In her testimony before the court, the victim’s mother, Olaniran Elizabeth, said, “I went out to hawk fish on that day and returned around 5:00pm, only to discover that my daughter’s movement was unstable. While checking her underwear inside the room, I discovered bloodstains and semen on her laps, when I inquired, she pointed and mentioned the detainee’s name to have done it to her. Some people in the neighborhood testified to seeing my daughter playing around with the detainee, he initially denied the offence but later confessed to the Police at Ido Ekiti.” Counsel to the defendant, Paul Ayantoyinbo, prayed the court to consider the defendant’s age who was only fifteen years at the time of commission of the offence and temper justice with mercy.
