The Adamawa State Police Command has nabbed two teenage boys for alleged rape. Thirteen-year-old Gambo Ali and 14-year-old Halidu Sani, who are cattle breeders at Sirigira in Guyuk Local Government Area, are being held for allegedly raping the 13 and 14 years old girls. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Suleiman Nguroje, told newsmen in Yola that the girls were raped when they were returning from church service at 2pm on Saturday, the 19th of February 2022. He added that the two suspects confessed to the crime, saying they were tempted. According to the police spokesman, the boys said while rearing their cattle, they saw the girls and could not help going after them. In a separate incident, 31-year-old Yaya Tizshe has allegedly defiled an 8-year-old girl at Viniklang, Girei Local Government Area of the state. Tizshe who confessed to the crime, according to the police, claimed that he was tempted by the devil. The man said it had become usual for kids in the vicinity to come to visit him as their uncle, and that on that fateful day, the little girl and her friends came to visit him. He added that she jumped on his body to play with him and he took advantage of her. Ngoroje said the minor, as well as the teenage girls similarly assaulted by the cattle breeders, were receiving medical attention.
