President Muhammadu Buhari has reacted to the spate of killings in the country, particularly the rise in ritual murders and deadly attacks against on-duty policemen and ethnic minorities. He has also condemned, the latest incidents which occurred in Enugu, Imo, Abia, Zamfara and Ogun States. The president described the incidents of ritual murders, hate crimes and killing of law enforcement officers as aberrations. While expressing the sympathy of the nation to families of all the victims, Buhari said law enforcement agencies, state governments, local authorities, community and religious leaders must rise against it by taking all lawful actions to prevent further incidents of such nature and put in place measures against the normalization of the primitive acts, hate crimes and acts of terror. “I condemn these dastardly acts of violence and pray for the souls of the departed,” said the President, adding that the courts of the land must apply “the strictest of punishment under our laws to the perpetrators of these horrific crimes.”
He said that killings in the name of rituals, political agitation and tribal hatred are not in keeping with the tenets of our religions and of the civilized and enlightened cultures we are all claiming to be, adding that “no person has the right to take the law in his or her own hands.” The President also emphasized the need for all Nigerians to be their brother’s keeper and should see an attack, be it verbal or physical on anyone, as an attack on the very essence that keeps us as a nation. Meanwhile, President Buhari has commended the government of Abia State for the actions it has so far taken on the incident a few days ago against traders at the New Cattle Market, in Ukwa Local Government Area of the state and appealed for calm. He equally expressed sympathies to the families of those killed and those who suffered loss of property following the attacks.
