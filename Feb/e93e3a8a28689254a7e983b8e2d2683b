Gunmen have invaded a fishing settlement, Ini-Ikwe, in Onna Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State and cut off the hand of a fisherman. They also carted away seven outboard engines within one week. One outboard engine, according to the spokesperson of fishermen, Mr Ernest Charlie, costs one million naira. Charlie, who stated this while making a formal complaint to the Chairman of Onna Local Government Area, Elder Iniabasi Ekanem, said fishermen’s safety was no longer guaranteed considering the persistent attacks on them by gunmen in the area. According to him, “Last week, gunmen collected six outboard engines from us and even cut off one of our friend’s hand during the attack. Just yesterday, one outboard engine was stolen again in our community.” While lamenting that their source of livelihood had been threatened, the spokesperson called on the government to beef up security in the area by deploying surveillance boats to stop further attacks. “Our sources of business in the community are dying because of insecurity in our waterways. The State government should please come to our rescue.
Gunmen are terrorizing us in our waterways and our safety is not guaranteed,” he said. Responding, the chairman of Onna, who was represented by Mr Phillip Ambrose, the Dean of Supervisors in Onna LGA expressed dismay over the attack by hoodlums in the waterways and sympathised with the affected fishermen. He explained that the council was collaborating with security agencies to tackle the security situation in the area. Ambrose promised to report back to the Authority and urged them to remain calm and not take laws into their hands.
