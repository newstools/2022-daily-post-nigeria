Popular media personality, Toke Makinwa has lamented the state of the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Lagos. Toke, who just arrived Nigeria, took to Twitter to complain about the faulty air conditioners at the airport. Her tweet read: ”Touch down Lagos Nigeria and the heat at the airport is insane, why will the AC at arrivals not work?” She lamented that “the fans blowing hot air and the officers having to work under such circumstances is sad. What a country! “I am standing at the arrivals dripping in sweat and all I can think is the officers in the box who have to endure this daily. “Like we’ve all just accepted this as normal cos we go into our cars with Air Conditioners after but these people who work here under such harsh conditions are human too. “No wonder they take out their anger and impatience on travelers. You enter Nigeria and pick up stress.”
