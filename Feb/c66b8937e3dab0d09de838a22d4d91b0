Senator Victor Lar, Campaign Director, Ali-Modu Sheriff Campaign Organisation, has debunked allegations that Sen. Ali-Modu Sheriff has links with the Boko Haram sect. Reports had emerged that Sheriff’s name was on the list of sponsors of Boko Haram recently released by the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Lar debunked the allegations on Sunday in Abuja. He explained that Sheriff, a two-term former governor of Borno State, had no links with Boko Haram. “Sheriff’s name is not on the list of sponsors of Boko Haram released by the United Arab Emirates (UAE), security agencies have been investigating him since he left office in 2011 and had not found him guilty of the allegations,” Lar told NAN. “If he was involved, he would have been arrested, or his involvement made public. In any case, I challenge anyone with information proving his involvement to come forth with such.” He added, “Having a case with the EFCC means standing trial or being prosecuted. Sheriff isn’t standing trial. In any case, those alleging should go to EFCC.”
