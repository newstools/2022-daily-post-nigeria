Nigeria has been re-elected into the African Union Peace and Security Council (AUPSC) for another three-year mandate (2022-2025). The country, representing West Africa, pulled 44 votes in the first round to secure victory. Victor Adeleke, Ambassador to Ethiopia and Permanent Representative to the AU, represents Nigeria. The election of the 15-member council was held during the 40th Ordinary Session (Ministers of Foreign Affairs) in Addis Ababa. Elected alongside the world’s most populous black nation were Cameroon, Djibouti, Morocco and Namibia. Elected for a two-year mandate were Burundi, Congo, Uganda, Tanzania, Tunisia, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Ghana, Senegal, and The Gambia. Nigeria is the only country that has sustained the membership of the PSC since its inception in 2004. The PSC conducts early warning and preventive diplomacy, facilitates peace-making, establishes peace support operations and recommends intervention to promote peace and security. The AU organ works in support of peace-building and post-conflict reconstruction as well as humanitarian action and disaster management. President Muhammed Buhari’s administration is accelerating the implementation of the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) and the African Governance Architecture (AGA) in line with the AU Agenda 2063 and the UN 2030 Agenda.
