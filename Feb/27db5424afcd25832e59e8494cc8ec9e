A legal practitioner, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, has condemned the arrest of Omoyele Sowore. The Sahara Reporters’ publisher was arrested on Thursday in Abuja by policemen for reasons undisclosed yet. Adegboruwa lamented that he’s been denied access to lawyers, doctors, family members, allies and comrades. The Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) said state machinery should not be unleashed against an individual “on account only that he seeks a better country”. “Sowore has been facing trial on account of his lawful campaigns for democracy and good governance. “He has been restricted to Abuja where he has been staying for well over four years”, his statement read. “Recently, the younger brother was attacked and brutally murdered in very suspicious circumstances. “I call upon the government of President Muhammadu Buhari to respect the fundamental rights of all citizens, including those of Sowore.” Adegboruwa said he should be released or charged to court for whatever offence that may be alleged against him.
