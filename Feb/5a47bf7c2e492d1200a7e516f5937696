Former Chairman, House of Representatives’ Committee on Appropriation, Abdulmumin Jibrin, has named former Lagos State Governor, Bola Ahmed Tinubu as the next President of Nigeria. According to him, Tinubu will surely succeed President Muhammadu Buhari, adding that the All Progressives Congress, APC’s national leader is the best candidate from the party come 2023. Jibrin said that just as Muhammadu Buhari was fielded and won the 2015 presidential election, so shall Tinubu beat all oppositions to claim the party’s sole ticket and win the election. The former Lagos Governor and Senator had a few weeks ago made his intention to run the presidential election public. Tinubu declared his interest after a closed door meeting with President Buhari at the State House. “In 2015, PMB was ahead of all the APC Presidential aspirants. He was fielded and he won! In 2023 race, Alh Bola Ahmed Tinubu is ahead, qualified, competent and CLEARLY has the best chance,” Jibrin tweeted. “He will be APC candidate. He will win the Presidential race and get the job done, God grace.” The latest member of the APC to declare for the position was a former Governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha. Okorocha announced his intention on Wednesday in a letter to the Senate President, which was read by Ahmad Lawan at the senate plenary.
