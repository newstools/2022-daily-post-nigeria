Former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has said if there is any truth to the rumours of a rift between Cristiano Ronaldo and Harry Maguire, then the club must act quickly to “f**king sort it out”. Several reports claim Ronaldo and Maguire are embroiled in a power struggle over who should captain the team. It is believed that Maguire, who is the current captain, feels undermined by Ronaldo’s presence in the dressing room. Maguire and United interim manager Ralf Rangnick have both denied the rumours, but Berbatov has said if there are any issues, then the two players should deal with them face-to-face. Berbatov told Betfair: “There is always rumour and gossip going around at any club and who knows if there is anything in the story of a clash between Harry Maguire and Cristiano Ronaldo over the captaincy. Harry says that’s not the case. I hope he’s right. “But if there is something to it then I hope they can speak face-to-face and sort it out. “What is for sure is that this is not the sort of thing United need right now. United are fighting for a top four spot which they need to achieve. “Nobody needs to be talking about this stuff right in the middle of the season.”
