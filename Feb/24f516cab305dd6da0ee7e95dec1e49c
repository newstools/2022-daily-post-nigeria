Former Kano State Governor, Ibrahim Shekarau, has stated that political platforms in Nigeria are the same. The Senator spoke in Sokoto on Sunday at an empowerment programme organized by Rep. Balarabe Salame (APC – Gwadabawa/Illela). He said parties have good people who have good intentions and bad people with selfish interests, NAN reports. Shekarau urged Nigerians to always elect those with “clean intentions” to ensure “collective development”. The stalwart declared his admiration that a PDP governor (Aminu Tambuwal) honoured the invitation of an opposition member. “The two political parties’ chairmen and supporters are in attendance, this is highly commendable. “We need to always keep in mind that God will judge us on our decision of choice of politicians to whom we give our mandate”, he said. The lawmaker hailed Sokoto’s political architecture and recommended it to other parts of the country.
