Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has appointed Lagos State Polytechnic (LASPOTECH) Rector, Dr Oluremi Olaleye, as the Acting Vice-Chancellor, Lagos State University of Science and Technology (LASUSTECH). Olaleye announced his appointment at a meeting with members of the institution’s staff, NAN reports. LASPOTECH became LASUSTECH after accreditation by the National Universities Commission (NUC) on February 2, 2022. Olaleye thanked the House of Assembly for approving the transmutation and Sanwo-Olu for his assent to the bill. The VC informed the workers that the governor assured no one would lose their jobs in the reorganization. He urged them to key into the new process, support the state government, governing council and management. “Lagos State Government knows that staff have families and for their needs to be met, nobody will be sacked. “We have about 60 PhD holders in this institution, the governor assured us that nobody will lose his or her job. “This institution will not be a conventional but a specialised university of science and technology. “Not until the last student graduates, LASPOTECH still exists. The students currently in school will graduate as OND/HND”, he said. Olaleye confirmed the reinstatement of four sacked non-academic staff. Their disengagement caused a seven month crisis that disrupted academic activities. LASUSTEH has been included in the ongoing Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) registration being conducted by the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB).
