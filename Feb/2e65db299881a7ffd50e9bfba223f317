A University don, Professor Armstrong Matin Adejo, has identified the magnitude of disrespect on campuses as a major fundamental factor that has been working against achieving a credible operational mentality of the youths. Adejo, who made the observation on Friday, while delivering a convocation lecture at the Federal University of Wukari, in Taraba State, felt sad that the youths have suddenly grown so large that they brush their elders aside on walkways without a hoot. The languages they employ as further made known by him are so bastardized and cheap that nothing constructively could be made out of them. Stressing on the need for all hands to be on deck in order to address such acts, old age, he said, no longer attracts respect, adding that the “consequences are that a majority hardly find mentors known in any credible system that recommends role models.” Outside the aforementioned, the despicable manner in which students wear their clothes, he said only suggests that evil days are really here. He said, “The ladies come out in most bizarre attires as they refuse to understand what is permitted in bedrooms from what is acceptable on the street. “If one dresses the way they do, the result, is definitely a canonization of sex trade, such indecent dressing sets the stage for madness, because the wearer and those confronted by such end up having poor results, terrible promiscuity and unrestrained spread of deadly ailments. “
