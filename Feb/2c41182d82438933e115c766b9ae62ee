Ademola Bayonle, a young medical doctor, has joined the Osun governorship race. The 35-year-old is seeking to become the Young Progressive Party (YPP) flagbearer for the July 16 exercise. Bayonle got his nomination form at the YPP National Secretariat in Abuja on Saturday, NAN reports. He noted that Ekiti and Osun elections give the youth an opportunity to set the pace ahead of the 2023 general polls. The aspirant urged citizens to take the bull by the horn and ensure the older generation leave behind a good structure. “If we allow them to continue to make decisions for us, thirty years from now when they are gone, we will be the ones to suffer the consequences. “Now is the time to join and make an impact for the future we want for ourselves and for the next generation. “A mistake often made by youths is believing that taking part in politics involves money to pick tickets to run for offices. “Politics goes beyond money, some people started the “Not-Too-Young-To-Run” campaign and that is participation”, he added. Bayonle encouraged young Nigerians to join political parties and contest for federal, state and local positions. He said those not contesting can contribute to the electoral process by engaging other youths and educating the elderly. The doctor urged the electorate to look beyond the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for fresh ideas.
