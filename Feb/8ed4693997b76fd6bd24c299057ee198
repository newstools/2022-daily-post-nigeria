Chelsea assistant coach, Zsolt Low, has hailed the performances of three Blues players following his side’s FIFA Club World Cup semi-final 1-0 victory over Al-Hilal on Wednesday evening. Low, who took charge of Chelsea’s first-team against Al-Hilal, lauded Romelu Lukaku, Kepa Arrizabalaga and Kai Havertz for their displays during the FIFA Club World Cup semi-final tie at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium. Recall that Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel who contracted COVID-19, did not travel with the team to the United Arab Emirates for the tournament. Lukaku scored the only goal of the tie in the first half to send Chelsea to the FIFA Club World Cup final, where they will face Brazilian side Palmeiras on Saturday. Speaking at his post-match press conference, Low said, “In the cup, he [Kepa] did a big performance to save the penalty. Today when we needed him he was there and made one big shape. He is in very good shape. He plays and trains well. We’re lucky to have him.” He added: “Everyone’s very happy Romelu scored. He fought very hard and tried hard in the last game. He did everything. That is why we give him the chance all the time. We hoped for a bit of luck to score today. He’s very happy, we are very happy and hope he continues and scores again in the final. “Kai had a good training week so that is why we decided to let him play. To see his quality in the game. He did his job very good, he had some dangerous attack situations and worked hard to close down spaces. He had a good game.”
