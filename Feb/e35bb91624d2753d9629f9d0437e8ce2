The Rapid Response Squad (RRS) of Lagos State Police Command has arrested a Tricycle Owners and Operators Association of Nigeria (TOOAN) leader, Azeez Abiola. Popularly known as Istijaba, he and others were on the verge of causing mayhem when they were apprehended. Others are Yusuf Azeez a.k.a Araba (42), Kazeem Akinbo a.k.a Womi (43), Taofiq Odewale, a.k.a Omo Iya Agba (38), and Moses Abiodun a.k.a Orobo (34). They were nabbed while leading supporters to NURTW headquarters in Agege, an action the authority believed would trigger violence across Lagos. Abiola and the rest had a pump action gun in their possession. His supporters fled the scene to evade arrest after sighting officers. The government, acting on intelligence, had warned that it would deal decisively with people trying to foment trouble in Agege and Abule Egba. RRS Commander, CSP Olayinka Egbeyemi, has been directed to reinforce patrol in the areas to forestall a breakdown of order. Commissioner of Police, CP Abiodun Alabi, has ordered transfer of the suspects and the exhibit to the State Command for investigation.
