Napoli coach, Luciano Spalletti has compared Victor Osimhen with the club’s legend, late Diego Armando Maradona, ahead of his side’s Europa League knockout round playoff tie with Barcelona on Thursday. Spalletti said Osimhen has the same ‘animal fury’ as Maradona. Osimhen is back on form after recovering from a cheekbone injury, either scoring or assisting in his last three Serie A games for Napoli. “With that header against Cagliari, he proved to have a sort of animal fury which is much-needed in key moments,” Spalletti said at the pre-match press conference ahead of the Barcelona clash, according to Football Italia. “Maradona had the same thing and somebody else should have it in our team. You can see Osimhen has it when he faces his opponents. “He has outstanding characteristics and some extra qualities that are not easy to find in other players,” he said. Meanwhile, Napoli played a 1-1 draw with Barcelona in the first-leg at Camp Nou last week.
