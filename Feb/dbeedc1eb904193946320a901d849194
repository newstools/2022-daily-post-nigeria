The Leader Of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, on Wednesday warned the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, concerning the future of his political career. In a statement signed by his media aide, Osho Oluwatosin, Primate Ayodele revealed that he foresees nemesis coming after Tinubu due to some things he did in the past. Ayodele said the politician had planted some unpalatable seeds that are now ripe for harvest. He explained that Tinubu hijacked power from some leaders in the course of his political career and the same thing is about to happen to him, except God decides to show him mercy. ‘’Tinubu has planted some seeds, and it’s time to harvest it. Unfortunately, they are not palatable seeds and they are about to come after him as nemesis. ‘’He will be betrayed by those he brought up. I see his past coming to hunt him in APC. In his political journey, he has hijacked power from some leaders and the same thing is going to happen to him in APC,” he said. ‘’He should not bother to struggle for the soul of his political career, the law of karma will apply to his political life. It is only God’s mercy that can save him from what is going to befall him.’’ Furthermore, Primate Ayodele explained that God loves Tinubu a lot, but some of his moves have proven that he doesn’t love himself. Speaking on his warnings to him, Primate Ayodele expressed his heartfelt love for the astute politician, making it known that he doesn’t have any personal issue with him but he has to say God’s mind about his political career. ‘’God loves Tinubu a lot but he doesn’t love himself. I am not his enemy, I love him a lot and I don’t have any personal issues with him. I love all that has to do with him but I have to speak the mind of God on his ambition. ‘’He should go and make spiritual consultations with other pastors. If they are truthful, they will tell him the same thing,’’ he added.
