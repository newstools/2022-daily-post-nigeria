The All Progressives Congress (APC) faction loyal to the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, in Osun State has condemned the conduct of the primary election, saying it is nothing but a sham with a fraudulent process to favour Governor Gboyega Oyetola. The faction claimed that the agent of Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, a candidate favoured by Aregbesola, informed another crack of the APC in the state that there is no record and result sheets in any of the 332 wards. Speaking on the absence of officials of Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), they also alleged that the figure declared for Oyetola was highly inflated in the affected wards. The Publicity Secretary of the faction, Abiodun Agboola, made this assertion in a statement on Saturday that there are a lot of irregularities in the conduct. Agboola further claimed that no proper accreditation was done in the majority of the ward collation centres where voting took place saying that the place where accreditation was done was in favour of Oyetola. According to the faction, “Verified information from the agents of Adeoti, our governorship aspirant, has it that there is no record and result sheets in any of the 332 wards of the state. “We strongly condemned the conduct of the primary election because it is nothing but a sham with a fraudulent process to favour Governor Oyetola.” Loyalists and supporters of Adeoti, according to Agboola, were chased while some were brutally attacked in wards where they have strong presence. The local government, according to him, includes Oriade, Olorunda and Osogbo, Odo-Otin, Boripe and Ile-Ife. The Aregbesola faction accused the Osun APC Primary Election Committee, led by Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrasaq of Kwara State, of lacking credibility and fairness.
