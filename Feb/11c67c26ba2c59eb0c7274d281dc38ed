As reactions continue to trail President Muhammadu Buhari’s assent to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill last Friday, the Accord Party says it predicted the President’s willingness to advance democracy in Nigeria. The party described the electoral amendment bill which was signed in less than one year to the general election as a ‘legacy bequeath’ to the nation, particularly the new clauses that are hoped would sanitize elections henceforth. In a statement by the National Legal Adviser of the party, Maxwell Mgbudem on Monday, the bill now an Act would create an opportunity for political parties to rejig their internal democracy towards electing credible leaders. Mgbudem, who is also the National Vice Chairman of the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), called on Nigerians who have attained the voting age to get registered with political parties of their choice and also obtain voter cards in readiness for 2023. The statement said: “The new Electoral Act will revolutionize the process of electing leaders at various levels of government. “The Bill will herald an era of competent and credible leaders who will emerge through a transparent voting exercise, hence the votes will begin to count.” Mgbudem explained that the assent was goodwill extended to Nigerians that must be replicated while lamenting that the Area Council elections which held in Abuja recently was marred by apathy He applauded legislators for working with the President to achieve the feat, noting that the will of the masses must be held as sacrosanct if Nigeria should get it right in her political evolution and development. Mgbudem hailed Nigerians for their patience, the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), the Media and other stakeholders for sustaining the pressure on both the executive and the Legislature to ensure that a new Electoral Act is passed and signed into law. The IPAC Vice Chairman, while expressing confidence that the 2023 general election will be credible, advised the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to swing into action to make the best out of the new Electoral law.
