Barcelona manager, Xavi Hernandez, has said he wants Frenkie de Jong to be at Barcelona “for many years”. Xavi stated this during his press conference ahead of their LaLiga clash against Valencia. De Jong has been linked with a move away from Camp Nou in recent months, amid increased competition in midfield from youngsters Pedri, Gavi and Nico. But Xavi said: “For me, Frenkie is a great player. I think he’s taken a step forward since we arrived. He’s a different player, more dynamic. “He had some discomfort in his calf which didn’t allow him to play well in the Supercopa against Real Madrid. “Now he looks comfortable, he isn’t losing the ball, he’s helping in defence, he’s getting into the box, he’s scoring goals. He’s a player to be at Barca for many years.” De Jong, 24, joined Barcelona from Ajax in a deal worth €86 million in 2019 and signed a long-term contract until 2026.
