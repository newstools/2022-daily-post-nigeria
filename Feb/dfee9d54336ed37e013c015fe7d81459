Ossai Success, an aide to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State, has condemned those praising Ikuforiji Olaitan Abdulrahman, also known as Oxlade, over his alleged leaked sex tape. Nigerians woke up to the sex tape on Wednesday, which has since gone viral on social media. Some fans, including UNILAG students hailed the Oxlade for the sexual prowess displayed by the singer. However, there were some comments criticising the singer who is yet to address the sex tape as of the time of filing this report. However, reacting, Success, in a post on his Facebook page, said those celebrating Oxlade over the video are a corrupt set of people. Making reference to Tiwa Savage’s sex tape, which was widely condemned by many Nigerians, Ossai asked Oxlade to apologise to Nigerians. He wrote, “Stop praising Oxlade, he should apologise to us. “Praising Oxlade when you condemned Tiwa Savage’s video is abnormal. “You cannot praise Oxlade and condemn Tiwa Savage knowing fully well that Oxlade’s video is not different from Tiwa’s video.”
