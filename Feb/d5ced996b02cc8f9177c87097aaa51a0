More than 200 terrorists have attacked communities in Kontagora, Mariga and Rijau local government areas in Niger State. They stormed the areas in a convoy of about 100 motorcycles and killed children at Bangi, a village in Mariga LGA. The assailants vandalized, burned, looted a number of houses and shops, stealing at least 250 cows along routes. The well-armed criminals operated “freely” as they did during previous invasions, PRNigeria quoted a source. “Aside sacking Argida, Babugadi, Warari, Birnin Boga, Mogola and others, they also killed little children at Bangi. “The bandits rustled no fewer than 250 cattle, which they moved to the dense Maonda forest”, he revealed. A military intelligence officer explained that bad weather prevented the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) from aerial bombardments. He said pilots are mindful of severe weather conditions due to adverse hazy weather including intense storms, poor visibility, high turbulence. “They adhere strictly to the metrological warnings on the deterioration of horizontal visibility occasioned by a noticeable advection of dust that comes with associated risks and dangers”, the officer added.
