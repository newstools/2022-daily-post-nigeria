The Kano Zonal Command of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has secured the conviction of one Muallayedi Mohammed Sani before Justice Hafsat Yahaya Sani of the Kano State High Court on a three count charge of conspiracy and forgery. The convict and one Sabinatu Aliyu Alhassan who is now at large were said to have engaged in foreign exchange racketeering, whereby they forged air tickets and visas to collect personal travel allowance, PTA, from commercial Banks at official rate and sell at higher rate in black market. One of the charges reads, “That you MUALLAYADI MUHAMMAD SANI sometime in October, 2021 in Kano, Kano State, within the Jurisdiction of this Honorable Court with intent to defraud, forged some documents titled “Air Ticket, Passport and VISA” purported to have been genuinely issued to facilitate collection of PTA (Personal Travel Allowance) from commercial Banks and thereby committed Forgery, an offence contrary to section 363 and punishable under section, 364 of the Penal Code Law.” The defendant, however, pleaded guilty to the charges. The prosecution counsel, Zarami Mohammed, therefore asked the court to convict him accordingly. Defence counsel, Patience Edamaku pleaded with the court to temper justice with mercy in sentencing her client. Consequently, Justice Sani convicted and sentenced Sani to seven years imprisonment with option of N200,000 fine.
