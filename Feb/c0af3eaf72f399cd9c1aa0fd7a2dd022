Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta, has insisted that his team still has a long way to go to finish in the Premier League top four this season. Arteta said this following Arsenal’s 2-1 victory over Brentford on Saturday. Arsenal defeated Brentford 2-1 at Emirates, thanks to goals from Emile Smith Rowe and Bukayo Saka. Christian Norgaard did score a late goal for Brentford. The win over Brentford means Arteta’s men are now in the sixth position on the Premier League table with 42 points from 23 games. The Gunners, however, have three games in hand. Speaking on Arsenal’s top-four chances, Arteta said at his post-match press conference after his side defeated Brentford, “There’s a long way to go, but we are a little bit closer.” He added, “I think we played really well [against Brentford]. We had so many attempts in the first half and in the Premier League, you have to put those away. “Overall, I think you should be happy with the result.”
