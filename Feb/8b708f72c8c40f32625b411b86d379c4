President Muhammadu Buhari has said that he desired to leave behind a legacy of a united, peaceful and prosperous Nigeria when he finally leaves office in 2023. Buhari also pledged his commitment to hand over a strong, diversified home-grown economy, stable democracy, repositioned agriculture-led and revamped armed and security forces to the next administration. The president stated this at a dinner in honour of the 2022 Committee of Business, Political, Media and Civil Society Leaders at the State House, Abuja, on Monday. He further assured Nigerians that his administration would finish strong in the last lap of his tenure. He said: “I am gradually entering my final year in office. It’s a period I intend to spend not only on consolidating on the achievements of the past seven years but also to leave a legacy for a united, peaceful, and prosperous Nigeria. “I take this initiative to mean that you all intend to collaborate with this administration in that direction. “For those among you who are politicians, you must look beyond gaining power to how you can leverage public positions in the process of societal change. “To the businessmen and women among you, there is great glory in public service.”
