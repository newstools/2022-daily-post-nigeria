The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, is to challenge the victory of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in three council areas of Kwali, Abaji and Gwagwalada in the February 12th council election in the Federal Capital Territory, FCT Abuja. Governor Samuel Ortom, who was chairman of the PDP Campaign Committee Council for the FCT election, disclosed this Monday, February 21st, 2022, at the Benue Peoples House, Makurdi, when he hosted Jemgbagh PDP Elders’ Forum, led by Barrister Samuel Tsumba. The Governor told the delegation that a son of Jemgbagh, Chief Sabastine Hon, SAN, had been engaged as lead counsel for the PDP to reclaim the mandate of the party in the other three council areas whose results were fraught with high level irregularities. He explained that the PDP’s victory in the three council areas, including Abuja Municipal Area Council, AMAC, Bwari and Kuje – in addition to 44 councilorship slots against APC’s 18 councilorship, was a clear indication that the opposition manipulated the council election. Governor Ortom was particularly happy that a son of Jemgbagh and National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Dr Iyorchia Ayu led the party to victory in the seat of power, describing him as a round peg in a round hole. The Governor described Jemgbagh as his second home, having been born and brought up in Gboko, pointing out that he had to reclaim his late father’s landed property in the area to serve as a mark of honour to those who raised him. Earlier, Chairman of the Jemgbagh PDP Elders’ Forum, Barrister Samuel Tsumba said their visit was to appreciate the Governor for the many good things he had done for Jemgbagh, including projects’ execution and appointments. He said the recent support of Governor Samuel Ortom to the emergence of their son, Dr Iyorchia Ayu as the National Chairman of the PDP was also greatly appreciated.
