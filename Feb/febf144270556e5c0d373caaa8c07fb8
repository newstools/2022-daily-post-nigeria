New Barcelona striker, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, could leave the club in June 2023, it has emerged. This is because the 32-year-old has an exit clause in the three-and-a-half-year deal he signed. The LaLiga side, in a statement on Wednesday, revealed Aubameyang has an option to agree to depart on June 30, 2023. There is also a €100million release clause in the Gabon striker’s contract. Aubameyang terminated his contract with Arsenal in order to join Barca as a free agent. An Arsenal statement on Tuesday night confirmed Aubameyang’s exit: “We wish Auba all the best for the next chapter in his career and thank him for his contribution to the club.”
