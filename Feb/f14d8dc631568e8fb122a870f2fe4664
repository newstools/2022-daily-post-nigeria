A group in the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Ekiti State, the Repositioning Group, has debunked claims by a former Governor of the State, Segun Oni, that its members were forming a grand coalition to win the June 18 governorship election. Chairman of the Ekiti PDP Repositioning Group, Alaba Agboola in a press statement said there was nowhere the group met with Segun Oni, or his agents to discuss any grand coalition. Agboola added that after the PDP governorship primary election that produced Bisi Kolawole as the candidate of the party, groupings in the party seized to exist, reasons why one of the major arrowheads of the Repositioning Group, Otunba Yinka Akerele, is now the Director-General of Bisi Kolawole Campaign Organization. Agboola said, “Members of the Ekiti PDP Repositioning Group are not political Harlots who move from parties to parties and as such cannot be part of any coalition with Oni, who obviously came to the PDP from the APC just for the purpose of using the PDP platform to contest the election. “Most importantly, two aspirants from the Repositioning Group, Otunba Yinka Akerele and Lateef Ajijola, who contested the PDP primary election are fully with the party’s candidate. “Therefore, members of the Repositioning Group are in PDP and in PDP will they remain and work with other members and supporters of the party to win the June 18 governorship election.”. ”Oni should desist from this namedropping vice that will only mislead the general public”, Agboola said.
