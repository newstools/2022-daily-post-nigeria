Singers, Zinoleesky and Mohbad have been apprehended by operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) after a midnight raid on their residence in Lagos. NDLEA spokesman, Femi Babafemi, who confirmed the story explained that cannabis and molly were recovered by the operatives in their residence. According to the spokesman, “Our men raided an area in Idado estate where Bịara Market boys stay. Some quantities of Cannabis sativa and Molly were recovered from their apartment and car.” He further explained that six persons were arrested in all with two females and four males. According to the spokesman, the arrest of the victims is coming weeks after the Agency arrested fast-rising skit maker, De General, after a raid on his residence in Lagos. He stated that De General was immediately charged to court and was convicted of trafficking tramadol and Cannabis sativa. He added that the skit maker was pardoned by the court on the grounds that the quantity of the drugs found on him was too small to earn him a sentence.
