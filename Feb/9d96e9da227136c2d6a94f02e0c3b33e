Former UEFA president and Juventus legend, Michel Platini, has revealed the mistake Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo and Paris Saint-Germain’s Lionel Messi made in their glittering career so far. Platini believes Ronaldo and Messi should have moved to the USA or China after leaving Real Madrid and Barcelona, respectively. Recall that Ronaldo left Real Madrid in 2018 for Juventus, where he spent three years before joining Man United in 2021. Messi, meanwhile, left Barcelona for PSG in the summer of 2021. “I respect Ronaldo and Messi, but I retired at 32,” Platini told La Gazzetta dello Sport. “I could’ve joined Barcelona or Marseille, but I wanted to be identified with the club that I had made history with. “Ronaldo was Real Madrid and Messi was Barcelona. If I were them, I would’ve moved to the USA or China, not to another big club.”
