Shehu Abdullahi has returned to full training with his Cypriot club Omonia, after being sidelined with injury. Abdullahi announced this via his Twitter handle on Friday. He wrote: ”I’m excited to return to full training. I appreciate your support and prayers. The love I got from the team management, coaching staff and my teammates was overwhelming.” The 28-year-old was one of several Super Eagles players who did not feature at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. He missed the tournament alongside the likes of Victor Osimhen, Paul Onuachu, Samuel Kalu, Leon Balogun and Oghenekaro Etebo. However, this represents a huge boost for Nigeria, ahead of their 2022 World Cup playoffs against Ghana in March.
