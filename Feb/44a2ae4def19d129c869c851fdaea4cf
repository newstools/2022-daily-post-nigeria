A local vigilante group has rescued two minors aged 12 and 13, who were allegedly being sexually molested by a National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) member, in Nkpolu Oruworukwo Community in the Mile Three area of Port Harcourt Local Government Area of Rivers State. The corps member is said to be the son of the minors’ guardian. The Chief Security Officer of the community, Godstime Ihunwo, who disclosed this to journalists in Port Harcourt, said the victims “have been handed over to the Rivers State Ministry of Social Welfare.” Ihunwo narrated how they had intercepted the victims “along with their junior sister last Thursday around 10 pm with their luggage”. On interrogation, they revealed that they ran away from the house because they “were being subjected to ill-treatment and sexual slavery”. According to Ihunwo, the children said their late aunty had told them that they were taken from “an orphanage home”. The matter has been reported at the Rumuolumeni Police Division but no arrest has been made.
