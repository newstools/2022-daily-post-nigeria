The newly-inaugurated chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, Ebonyi State chapter, Mr. Stanley Okoro, on Friday, expressed optimism that the governor of the state, David Umahi, will pick the ticket of the party as its presidential flag bearer. Mr. Okoro made this known while addressing stakeholders and party supporters during a heroic welcome reception given to him on his return from Abuja. He said that Umahi is qualified to fly the flag of the party as its presidential flag bearer, adding that the incumbent governor will emerge as the next president of Nigeria. The chairman said he should be held responsible, should the party fail in Ebonyi State. “Ebonyi State is not one of the states you will be doubting will win the general election. Even PDP, which is the opposition party, will still vote for APC in Ebonyi State because of the achievements of the governor. “The person that will take over will only maintain the projects. I want to let you know that I am back. Woe unto me if the party fails in Ebonyi. “I am very confident with what I am seeing. People are seeing me as a Villa boy. Something great will happen. I have so much confidence that he will fly the party’s flag and eventually emerge as president in 2023. “We have never had any parallel congress in Ebonyi State,” Okoro boasted.
