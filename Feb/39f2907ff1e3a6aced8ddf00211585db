Deji Adeyanju, an Abuja-based rights activist, on Thursday, accused the All Progressives Congress, APC, and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, of ignoring the southeast for the 2023 presidency. Adeyanju alleged that the APC and PDP are not considering the southeast for the 2023 presidency. In a tweet, the convener of the Concerned Nigerian Advocacy group accused Nigeria of being unfair to the southeast. Adeyanju said the southwest should not be considered for the presidency in 2023. He explained that the southwest produced a president that ruled Nigerians for eight years and produced a vice president for another eight years. Adeyanju wrote: “Equity demands that power should naturally go to the South East. The southwest should not even be in the picture at all. “8yrs of OBJ + 8yrs of Osinbajo but this country is very unfair. However, both APC & PDP are not even considering SE at all.” APC National Leader, Bola Tinubu is aspiring to run for the presidency in 2023. The former Governor of Lagos State hails from the southwest.
