President Muhammadu Buhari has urged nations, institutions, private and public bodies, to return Nigeria’s artefacts in their possession. Buhari made the call on Monday in reaction to Britain’s handover of Okukur and the Head of Oba of Benin bronzes, to the monarch, HRH Oba Ewuare II. The artefacts were taken away by British soldiers in 1897 when they attacked the ancient Benin Kingdom. They were repatriated from the University of Cambridge and University of Aberdeen after125 years. The President thanked the schools, and the UK government for issuing the prerequisite Export Permits to Nigeria at no cost. ”These are unprecedented moves worth emulating by others”, the President said while encouraging Britain to return others. He assured that the arts would be returned to museums and other facilities in conjunction with the royal families and kingdoms. Buhari also commended Germany which is in the process of repatriating 1,130 Benin bronzes this year. The Nigerian leader hailed the High Commissioner to the UK, Sarafa Ishola, and the National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM) for their efforts.
