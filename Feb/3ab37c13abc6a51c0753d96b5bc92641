Zamfara State House of Assembly has served the Deputy Governor, Mahdi Aliyu-Gusau, with a notice of impeachment for alleged gross abuse of office. Shamsudeen Bosko, Chairman, House Standing Committee on Information, spoke to the media in Gusau on Monday. The lawmaker announced that Aliyu Gusau was served the notice through the Secretary to the State Government. Bosko said the notice was part of the constitutional duties of the legislature in line with the Section 188 of the 1999 constitution, as amended. The lawmaker accused the deputy governor of rushing to the Federal High Court in Abuja to stop the process. The court had ordered the maintenance of ‘status quo ante Bellum’ by both parties on the matter. Bosko recalled that the House obeyed and obtained ex parte, an order with specific days of life span. Gusau is being accused of abusing his office in violation of Sections 190 and 193 (1), (2) (a)(b)(c) of the 1999 constitution, as amended. Other allegations against him include: “self-enrichment using public funds, criminal diversion of state funds, conspiracy to defraud the state and approval of dubious retirements in his office and failure to discharge constitutional duties, amounting to insubordination.”
