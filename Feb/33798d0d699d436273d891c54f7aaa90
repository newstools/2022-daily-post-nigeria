A member of the House of Representatives representing Iseyin/ Itesiwaju/Iwajowa/Kajola Federal Constituency, Hon. Shina Abiola Peller, has declared that only sports will bring the needed unity and development to Oke Ogun geopolitical zone in Oyo State. Peller made this disclosure while speaking at a press conference heralding the second edition of Peller Unity Cup on Wednesday at Okeho in Kajola Local Government Area of the state. The lawmaker, while speaking at the event, which had in attendance the Onjo of Okeho, Oba Rafiu Osuolale, representative of Aseyin of Iseyin, Oba Abdulganiy Adekunle Ologunebi, ex-Super Eagle players, among others, lamented that Oke Ogun as a region in Oyo State is underdeveloped. He said that the major contributing factor to the stagnant stage of the region is disunity. Peller, however, insisted that the only panacea to bring unity and development to the region is sports. He remarked that sports, especially football, will be an avenue to help bring the people together as one, and that will at the same time promote peace, youth engagement and development. The lawmaker said that there is a need for stakeholders in the area to come together to use sports to promote peace and unity in the community. He said, “Football, being a universal language that everyone understands, helps connect people together irrespective of tribal, political or religious belief. It helps to unite people. “Our discussion bordered on Oke Ogun as a region in Oyo State, its underdevelopment and what could have been a major contributing factor to its stagnant stage. “It was during this period that it dawned on me that disunity was one of the major factors for the underdevelopment. “Let us make use of this common phenomenon (football) to achieve extraordinary and uncommon things that all will be proud of,” he said.
