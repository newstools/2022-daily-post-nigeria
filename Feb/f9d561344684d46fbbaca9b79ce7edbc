Known to have kept his relationship status from the prying eyes of the public, the actor told DAILY POST he would like to get married to an ambitious woman he could build a family with. “I respect all women and feel they deserve nothing short of the best. However, for my choice of woman for marriage, I like them with big boobs and curves,” he said. “Also, I love that feeling of resting my head on my woman’s asset while sleeping. It gives me a great relief especially coming home after a busy day at work. Breast is life.” Pitakwa, who is known for his energetic display in some of his action-packed movies, added, “Marriage is a beautiful thing. I love to have kids and build with my woman. Aside acting, I also try to engage in other businesses. “I do one or two businesses in multimedia, and real estate. I don mark some faces on ambassadorial deals too.
