Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel has reacted after record signing, Romelu Lukaku only had seven touches in 90 minutes of their 1-0 win away at Crystal Palace on Saturday. Chelsea returned to Premier League action after nearly one month, following their Club World Cup victory. Hakim Ziyech gave the visitors their much-needed victory after he fired home in the 89th minute. But Belgium striker, Lukaku only had two touches of the ball in the first half and only managed another five in the second half. Tuchel had gone with a different formation against Palace, ditching his usual back three to play a 4-1-4-1 Asked whether the new formation was responsible for Lukaku only having seven touches, Tuchel shrugged his shoulders and replied bluntly: “No. No, it’s not about the system,” he told beIN Sports. “Well, it is what it is. But it is for him no change of system because it’s the same attacking structure. “We always attack in a 4-1, it’s just for the build-up sometimes we build-up in a 3-2 and sometimes in a 4-1. For him, it changed nothing.” Asked a similar question during his post-match press conference, the German added, “I’m not so sure if I have a good answer for your question, I don’t know. “Obviously he was not involved and could not make a point today. I’m not sure if it says so much about us in general.”
