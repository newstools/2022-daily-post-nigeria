As many as 1000 children in Odukpani and Calabar South LGAs of Cross River State have so far been inoculated in the ongoing National Immunization Plus Days (NIPD,) a periodic health intervention scheme. This was disclosed in Calabar by the Director-General of the state Primary Healthcare Development Agency, Dr Janet Ekpenyong at the end of the medical visitations to both local governments. She said the NIPD was created to ensure total vaccination of children within the ages of 0-59 months against Polio and some childhood killer diseases. She disclosed that health workers were mobilised to designated centres spreading across markets, schools, churches and other strategic locations in two councils. While addressing some parents and caregivers in their various houses and locations, Ekpenyong appreciated them for taking their wards and children out for vaccination, describing them as ‘collaborative agents of change” and important stakeholders in the quest for Universal Health Coverage. She urged them to help sensitize their friends and other community members to always visit health centres and discontinue the patronage of local medicines which has little or no regulations. Ekpenyong emphasised that the agency seeks to actualize the ‘Zero missed child’ target in the ongoing National Immunization Plus Days Exercise. She said there is no form of discrimination in any community irrespective of topographic challenges as health interventions are enjoyed by all.
