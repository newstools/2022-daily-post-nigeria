Manchester United legend, Wayne Rooney, has said that the club will not qualify for Champions League this season. The former England striker believes that Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham are the teams to finish in the top four this season. Manchester United have struggled to impress this campaign, currently lying fifth in the Premier League table after a disappointing 1-1 draw against Burnley on Tuesday night. Asked whether United will qualify for the Champions League this term, Rooney told talkSPORT, “I think it’s going to be tough, if I’m being honest. You can see confidence is low and there are other issues going on around the club. “They’ve certainly got the players there and they have got some good results of late, but performances haven’t been great, that has to improve. “Them players need to show their character, show they’re all together and fighting for that club – because there are games I have watched when you question that at times. That’s me being honest. “If it carries on going the way it’s going, I don’t think United will get top-four. I think there needs to be serious conversations among the players, without coaches and staff there. When pressed on who he thinks will finish fourth, with Spurs, Arsenal and West Ham in close proximity, Rooney said: “Tottenham, I think they might sneak in there, they’ve got a very good manager.”
