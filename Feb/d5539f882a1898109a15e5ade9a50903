Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, on Monday, condemned the removal of state police from the amendment of Nigeria’s constitution. He called the development a disservice, noting that the prolonged spate of insecurity made the demand a necessity. In a statement by his spokesman Kehinde Aderemi, Adams said he long a feeling that the legislators “would not come out with anything that reflects the interest of the people”. The traditional leader decided the alleged selfishness of the Senate, declaring that the amendment is “mired in unnecessary politicking”. He said the State Police removal from the altercation process shows that the National Assembly members are not worthy representatives. “The Red Chamber didn’t consider the need for State Police, which could have helped in addressing the pressing security challenges we face daily. “Their plan was to hide under the cover of the law to improve their political leverage and boost their interests; nothing more. “The security situation is a major challenge in the country and the Senate decided to look the other way by removing State Police from amendment.” Adams said the process was already an “exercise in futility” and that the lawmakers would not achieve desired objectives. The Aare further accused them of seeking immunity, life pension and other paraphernalia, forgetting they are representing the masses.
