Former West Brom attacker, Kevin Phillips has claimed that Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba could leave the club and complete a shock move to Premier League rivals, Tottenham Hotspur or Arsenal. Pogba is expected to leave Man United at the end of the season. The France World Cup winner is yet to sign a new deal with Man United and his contract will expire this summer. The 28-year-old has scored just one goal and registered eight assists in 18 games for Manchester United across all competitions so far this season. “It is an interesting one. The big question is, who can afford him? “There is no way he would go to Man City and I can’t see him going to Chelsea either. When I look at it, those two clubs are out of the question. “I think Tottenham could be an option though. Would he be able to play under [Antonio] Conte in that system? Conte certainly got the best out of him at Juventus. That relationship makes it possible. “Arsenal is another club. He could slot in alongside Thomas Partey. The financial side of it would be big. It is going to be a massive contract for someone to take on. Will you get the best out of Pogba week in, week out? I think it is more likely that he goes abroad, in all honesty,” Phillips told Football Insider while discussing Pogba’s future.
