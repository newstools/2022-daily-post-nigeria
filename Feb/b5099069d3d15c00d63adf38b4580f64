Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Monday, gave his assent to three bills. The bills signed at the State House were passed by the House of Assembly in 2021. Sanwo-Olu said his action will enhance good administration, improve governance and move Lagos State towards a more organised society. The first law regulates real estate transactions; the second demands compulsory registration of cooperative societies. The third regulates ownership, licensing and sales of pets and prohibits people from keeping dangerous animals as pets. Sanwo-Olu hailed Lagos Speaker, Mudashiru Obasa and the lawmakers for their work. “We will continue to ensure that our citizens are getting good governance and that trust in government is further deepened,” he assured.
