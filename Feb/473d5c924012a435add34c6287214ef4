Former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, says youths have a huge role to play in the 2023 presidential and general elections. The two-time Governor of Kwara State spoke at the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Women’s Leaders Meeting in Abuja. Saraki reacted to the advice by ex-Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu, asking youths to wait for him to be president. The All Progressives Congress (APC) leader made the comment during a visit to the Alaafin of Oyo on Sunday. “If you become the president, you want to chase us from the streets? You’ll become old and be president but after me”, Tinubu said. Responding to a question on the comment, Saraki stated that young Nigerians and women formed majority of voters. “I hear a lot of politicians saying that today. (telling youths to wait after 2023). We should check their records. “Women and the youth have a great role to play. At the end of the day, governance is about providing for the people and 70% of them are under 25! “Is that role elective or appointed…They must play a role. I have always worked with the youths because they are very important”, the PDP chieftain noted.
