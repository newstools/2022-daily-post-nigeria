Former Ghana striker, Asamoah Gyan, has admitted the 2022 World Cup playoffs between his country and Nigeria next month could go either way. Gyan explained the tie is difficult to predict, because of the long-standing rivalry between the two West African countries. “Ghana and Nigeria are rivals, you cannot predict,” he told TV3. “Anybody can win, so we just have to stay focused and do what they have to do on the field.” Incidentally, Gyan was the match winner for the Black Stars the last time they faced Nigeria at the 2010 AFCON in Angola. Ghana will host Nigeria on March 24, with the return leg three days later in Abuja.
