A renowned politician, Dr Jamil Isyaku Gwamna (Sardaunan Gombe), has dumped the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, and joined the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in his bid to contest Gombe State gubernatorial seat in 2023. Gwamna exited the ruling APC after making huge consultations. He announced his entry into the PDP when he met with a former governor of the State and Gombe State PDP leader, Dr Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo, on Tuesday. He said, “we are here today for two things: to visit you and cement our existing relationship as brothers and to also inform you that I have returned to the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. “I assure you that we are going to unite ourselves to return the PDP to government in the State come 2023,” he said. In his response, Dankwambo thanked Gwamna and his entourage for the visit, welcomed him to the PDP and assured him of his support, as well as the unity of the party. “Sardauna is my brother and I welcome him back to our fold,” the former govenor acknowledged, promising, “we’ll work together for the unity and the success of the party.” Dankwambo further advised the Sardaunan Gombe and his entourage to go back to the grassroots and mobilise the people for the party ahead of the 2023 general elections. DAILY POST reports that Gwamna left the PDP ahead of 2019 general elections in protest after losing the governorship ticket. He is the current Managing Director of the Kano Electricity Distribution Company, KEDCO.
