The Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) has advised persons interested in buying lands in Lagos State to carry out a thorough verification. The Federal Controller of Housing in Lagos, Margaret Adejobi, made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday. The official urged the media to embark on awareness campaign against grabbers, complaining that they sold-off gazetted FGN lands in the state. Adejobi advised citizens to always check lands with with federal and state government agencies before purchase. She said grabbers ignore compensations paid to their fathers, encroach on gazetted government lands and fraudulently sell the same to multiple buyers. “Every day, I receive court summons, petitions. Even learned people fall victims to these land grabbers. Anybody who wants to buy land should do a search. “They can go to the Surveyor General’s Office in Alausa, or our office here at the Tafawa Balewa Square and check”, the controller said. Adejobi announced that a Presidential Implementation Committee had sold off nearly all FGN buildings in Lagos.
