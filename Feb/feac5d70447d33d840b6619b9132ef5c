West Ham United defender, Kurt Zouma, now faces up to four years in French prison for abusing his cat. The footballer was filmed by his brother kicking and slapping his pet cat and the footage was uploaded to Snapchat by the 27-year-old’s younger brother, Yoan. Two cats belonging to the player, including the abused one, have been taken away by the RSPCA after shocking footage showed him abusing them. West Ham has also fined him £250,000 – two weeks’ worth of wages – and axed him from the squad for the next game. The incident has universal condemnation as a consequence, despite Zouma’s speedy apology. A petition calling for legal action to be taken against him has already attracted over 100,000 signatures. The Daily Mail reports that a legal complaint has been filed against the player in Paris. And at the moment, lawyers working for the largest animal rights group in France, La Fondation 30 Millions d’Amis, have contacted prosecutors. A spokesman for the Foundation said: “We condemn this heinous act, have asked that the player be suspended from the France team, and filed a legal complaint against him,” According to Metro. Article 113-6 of the French Penal Code states that a French citizen can be prosecuted for criminal acts carried out abroad. Tough legislation was put in place in France last year which could land anyone guilty of mistreating animals with a prison sentence of up to four years.
