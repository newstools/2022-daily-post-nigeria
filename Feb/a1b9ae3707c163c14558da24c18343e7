Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, appears to have accelerated his plan to make Gabriel Martinelli his top striker, Football London reports. Arteta failed to bring in a new striker in the January window and still allowed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to move to Barcelona. The Gunners have netted just 34 times this season, the least of the top six in the Premier League. Emile Smith Rowe is Arsenal’s top scorer with nine goals in all competitions. Following Aubameyang’s exit, Arteta has just Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah, with both players out of contract in the summer. However, Arteta is eager to pull off his plan of converting Martinelli into a No. 9. The Brazilian is more used to playing out wide, cutting in on his right foot – but that could change, as he has been playing as a striker in training sessions at London Colney. The 20-year-old has made 21 appearances so far in all competitions, making seven goal contributions.
