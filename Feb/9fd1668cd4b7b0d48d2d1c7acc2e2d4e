Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State has said terrorist group, the Islamic State of West Africa Province, ISWAP, should not be allowed to grow. Zulum lamented that ISWAP members are more sophisticated, funded, and educated. He stressed that Boko Haram would be a child’s play if ISWAP is allowed to grow in the Northeast. Zulum spoke on Thursday at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, where he appealed to the military to ensure it defeats ISWAP. The governor warned that ISWAP is a threat to Nigeria. According to Zulum: “We shouldn’t allow ISWAP to grow. ISWAP are more sophisticated, more funded and they are more educated. And we shall do everything possible to defeat ISWAP. “Otherwise, what Boko Haram did will be a child’s play. This is an early warning that the Nigerian Army has to restrategise and defeat ISWAP. “ISWAP will be a threat to the entire nation. Because of its proximity to Sub Saharan Africa, they are coming from Libya and others resettling here.”
