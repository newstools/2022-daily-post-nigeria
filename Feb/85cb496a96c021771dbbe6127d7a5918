The clampdown on illegal fuel marketers by the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Kwara State command, yielded a positive result on Thursday, with the arrest of two persons who were engaging in black market business. The two suspects, Yunus Yusuf, (32) and Ismail Olamilekan, (33) were caught with 30 kegs of petrol meant for illegal black market business at Eyenkorin axis of Ilorin, Kwara State capital. They allegedly bought the 30 kegs of petrol from a neighbouring State and brought them to Kwara, to be sold at a high price to end users in Ilorin, the State capital. The suspects were intercepted in a taxi cab at Eyenkorin axis, loaded with the 30 kegs of petrol, the spokesperson of the NSCDC in the State, Babawale Afolabi disclosed to newsmen in Ilorin on Thursday. He said the two suspects in their confessional statements, admitted to be engaging in black market business of petrol, adding that “they went to Ogbomoso, Oyo State to buy the product which they intended to sell at exorbitant prices to desperate end users in Ilorin, the State capital.” Babawale, said “as directed by the State Commandant of the NSCDC, Makinde Iskil Ayinla, the anti-vandal unit of the corps led by the Commander, Ayinde Yusuf, has continued its operational activities in order to check any action or inaction that can worsen the current fuel scarcity situation.” He restated the readiness of the command to make life difficult to all saboteurs who are bent on making life difficult for the people by compounding the current fuel scarcity situation. The spokesman said the suspects would be charged to court after the completion of investigations into the matter.
