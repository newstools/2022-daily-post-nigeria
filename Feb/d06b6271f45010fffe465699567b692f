Prof. Pat Utomi, a political economist, has spoken on plans to join the presidential race in the 2023 election. Utomi, a former presidential candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Lagos that he does not need a title to make contributions in Nigeria. When asked if he would contest for the office of the president, Utomi said: “It is not a criminal offence. We will cross that bridge when we get there. “Our commitment is to a better society. I don’t need a title to make a contribution to the betterment of my country. “If it then turnouts that a title drops itself in, well, so be it, but I don’t need a title to make a difference to my country’s history. “I think people are obsessed with titles. Let’s first build a great Nigeria and history will remember those who it will remember with or without titles,” he said. Utomi noted that how Nigeria would be led in 2023 would determine where it would be in the comity of nations.
