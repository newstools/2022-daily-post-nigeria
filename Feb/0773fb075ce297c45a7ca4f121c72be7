An Area Court Judge in Adamawa State has been removed for incompetence. Chief Judge of the state, Hon. Justice Nathan Musa, removed the Presiding Judge of Lunguda Area Court sitting in Guyuk Local Government Area, Hon. Jemison Fawe, over what he termed gross incompetence. Nathan, who doubles as Chairman of the state Jail Delivery Committee, reached the decision to remove Fawe, when the committee visited Guyuk Correctional Centre in continuation of prison decongestion on Thursday. He had, upon observing issues at the correctional centre, ordered Fawe to report at the headquarters in Yola. The ill-fated judge was subsequently shown the way out Friday on charge of convicting and sentencing a man to three years in prison allegedly without a fair hearing and without being given the option of a fine. The judge was said to have convicted the man and jailed him three years when he was arraigned over the allegation that he exchanged words with his mother. The convict, who was among people serving jail terms at the correctional centre in Guyuk, had been arrested and arraigned by the police over a misunderstanding between him and his mother as reported to the police by his elder brother. Fawe was said to have convicted the man “without hearing a word from him” over what in his perspective happened between him and his mother. The lucky convict and four others at the Guyuk Correctional Centre were discharged by the Jail Delivery Committee.
