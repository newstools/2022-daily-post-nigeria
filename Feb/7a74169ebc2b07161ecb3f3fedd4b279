A Nigerian activist, Deji Adeyanju, has reacted to the video currently making the rounds on social media where the cloth of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu appears soaked with a yet-to-be-identified liquid after he got up from a seat to address some of his loyalists. In the video, a man on suit, who is believed to be one of the APC chieftain’s security detail was seen staring at the wet part of the dress while closing his nostrils. Adeyanju, who has always maintained that Nigeria does not need a sick or an old President to take over from President Muhammadu Buhari, whose frail health is believed to have dragged the country backward, said those working with Tinubu should endeavour to get quality diapers for him. “They should get quality pampers for political ancestor so that his poo or pee won’t show next time. And people around don’t have to be covering their noses,” he tweeted. “Political ancestor urinated on himself and his security aide is seen covering his nose. Oh, Naija for show!” Bola Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos and also an ex-Senator, had recently declared to run in the 2023 presidential election, vowing to make Nigerians happy.
