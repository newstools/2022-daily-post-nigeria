Arsenal legend, Thierry Henry has a verdict on the club’s chances of finishing within the top four teams in the Premier League this season. According to the Frenchman, Mikel Arteta’s team’s season should be considered a ‘failure’ if the Gunners miss out in the Champions League. The north London side sit sixth place in the Premier League table but have three games in hand over Manchester United and West Ham. West Ham are fifth while Manchester United are in fourth position. ‘The best thing about Arsenal is that they didn’t play,” Henry told CBS Sports. “West Ham didn’t take advantage of it. Tottenham has never taken advantage of it. “But Arsenal had to go and win at Wolves. That was a massive win, so there are still a lot of games to go. “For me, if they don’t do it, as I said at the start of the season, then it will be a failure.”
