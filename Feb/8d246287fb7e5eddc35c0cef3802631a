Brazil coach, Tite, will give up his position after the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar later this year. Tite said on Friday: “I will not lie, I’m just staying until the end of the World Cup.” The 60-year-old, however, hopes to end his career on the highest note possible. “I don’t just want to win something. I have won everything in my career. The only thing that is missing is the World Cup.” Brazil are among the favourites ahead of Qatar, having not yet lost in South American qualifying. Tite has led Brazil since 2016 but lost in the quarter-finals to Belgium at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. A year later Brazil won the Copa America and were defeated at home in the final by rivals Argentina in 2021.
