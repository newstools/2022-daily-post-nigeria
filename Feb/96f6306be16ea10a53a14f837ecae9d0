Abdul’aziz Yari, a former Governor of Zamfara State, was on Saturday, flown to the United Kingdom in a wheelchair. According to SaharaReporters, the former Governor was in a bad shape medically when he arrived the international airport ahead of the flight to the UK. Yari was reported to have departed Nigeria in a British Airways aircraft. “Ex-Governor Yari is flying to the UK on British Airways flight for a medical trip. He was even brought in a wheelchair,” a source at the airport told SaharaReporters on Saturday. Recall that Yari, who was Governor of Zamfara State from May 2011 to May 2019, was detained by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, in April 2021, over alleged illegal financial dealings and misappropriation of funds. A Federal High Court in Abuja also ordered the final forfeiture of funds belonging to him, domiciled in Zenith and Polaris banks.
