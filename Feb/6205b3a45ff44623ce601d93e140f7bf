Senator Shehu Sani, a governorship aspirant in Kaduna State, says some armed bandits blocked their way when they were travelling to Kebbi State for a wedding. In a tweet on his verified Twitter handle, the former lawmaker who represented Kaduna Central at the 8th National Assembly said upon receiving information on the activities of the bandits, he was forced to turn back. The tweet reads, “We were heading to Kebbi for a wedding, we were informed that bandits have blocked the road. “Some said we should pray and move on, I’ve joined those who prayed and moved back home”. DAILY POST reports that there have been cases of attacks in many parts of the state by the bloodthirsty bandits who have continued to launch attacks on unsuspecting residents. A month ago, about 16 people were confirmed killed in an attack on some communities in the Danko Wasagu Local Government Area of the state. The police spokesperson in the state, Nafi’u Abubakar, who confirmed the incident, revealed that two soldiers, a police officer and 13 residents were killed during the attack at Dankade village.
