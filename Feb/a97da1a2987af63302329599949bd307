Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, has criticized his players, including Cristiano Ronaldo, for losing composure and making wrong decisions during their Premier League 1-1 against Southampton on Saturday. Ronaldo was unable to save Man United as two goals from Jadon Sancho and Che Adam ensured both the Red Devils and Southampton shared a point each at Old Trafford. Manchester United have now failed to win back-to-back games after failing to beat Southampton. Rangnick’s side had drawn against Burnley before the Southampton match. “Unfortunately, again, it’s very similar to the last couple of games,” Rangnick said at his post-match press conference. “We had a very good first-half hour, we did all the things we intended to do with the counter attacks and deep runs, it is the way we created and prepared a great goal. But we stopped doing that, and in the second-half we lost a bit of shape. “We struggled to defend them in transition. We had enough chances in the last 20 minutes to score again, the expected-goal ratio was clearly in our favour, but in the end, we didn’t get the result we wanted. “But we lost composure, and took the wrong decisions, sometimes under pressure, sometimes not. This is where we have to get better.”
