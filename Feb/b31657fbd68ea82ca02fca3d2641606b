The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has asked the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, to resign his position from the apex bank before entering the race for 2023 presidency. In a statement signed by its director, Prof. Ishaq Akintola, MURIC insisted that following due process will prove that Emefiele respects decorum, law and order. The group said it was not against Emiefele’s ambition to become Nigeria’s President as a bona fide citizen of the country, having met the conditions. MURIC said it does not doubt Emefiele’s credentials, but insists the CBN boss should follow due process. “The last time we checked, however, the governor of the Central Bank is still in public service and Nigeria’s public service rules forbid someone in such a position from participating in electioneering campaigns,” MURIC said. It reminded the CBN Governor that he is also forbidden from contesting an election, adding that it would amount to a gross infringement on electoral rules and regulations if he fails to resign. MURIC, which says it has in its possession the campaign leaflets of the CBN Governor, called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to call Emefiele to order. MURIC said the CBN Governor should resign his position as a public servant before campaigning ahead of the forthcoming election, adding that a man in charge of the nation’s wealth cannot afford to flout the law.
