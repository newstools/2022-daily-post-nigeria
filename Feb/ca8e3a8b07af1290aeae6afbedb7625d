The Secretary, Zamfara State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Hon. Ibrahim Umar Birinin Magaji has lamented that politics of bitterness and rancour would worsen the security challenges in the State. Magaji stated this in an exclusive interview with DAILY POST in Gusau, the State capital, advising opponents of Governor Matawalle to sustain the State’s political tradition of unity and peace to move the State forward. He noted that despite the current political feud between former Governor Abdul Aziz Yari and Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle, they still maintained their cordial relationship, which he said would help in developing the State. “I can recall how the fraternal and cordial political relationship between Governor Matawalle and former Governor Abdul Aziz Yari, which was strengthened by Senator Ahmad Sani Yarima, has yielded beneficial results to the State,” he said. The Secretary emphasized that APC was very much ready to and willing to make peace with its members who refused to revalidate their membership. “The party had made some strategic plans to sanitize and develop the political activities of the State in its position as the ruling party,” he said. Magaji said that all hands need to be on deck to fight the security challenges in the State, stressing that politics of bitterness and rancour should be eliminated through a formidable political front.
