Chelsea goalkeeper, Edouard Mendy has insisted that he was not surprised by what teammate, Kepa Arrizabalaga did while he was away at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, with the Senegal national team in Cameroon from January to early February. Mendy is still considered the first-choice goalkeeper at Stamford Bridge, but while he was at AFCON, Kepa took charge between the sticks for Chelsea. The Spaniard shot-stopper impressed everyone, and there were a few calls for him to remain in goal. However, Mendy took the gloves back as soon as he returned from international duty with Senegal following their AFCON triumph. Speaking during his pre-match press conference on Monday ahead of Chelsea’s Champions League round of 16 first-leg tie with Lille on Tuesday night, Mendy claimed that his relationship with Kepa is good even though they are fighting for the number one jersey at Chelsea. Mendy said, “My relationship with Kepa is good since I came here. We have a good relationship on and off the pitch. “He did really well when I was at AFCON, but it didn’t surprise me because I saw him every day at training. I was super happy for him because he deserves it. “When you play for Chelsea, you’ve competition in every position, so you have to give your best and play at your highest level to be in the team at the weekend.”
