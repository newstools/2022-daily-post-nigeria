Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, says the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is working towards uniting stakeholders ahead of the 2023 election. Wike spoke to reporters in Jos, the capital, after a peace meeting attended by a number of party chieftains. In attendance were former Governor, Jonah Jang and ex-Governor of old Bendel State, Jeremiah Useni. Wike, in a Facebook post on Thursday, said the parley was successful as all in attendance agreed to drop their grievances. “They agreed to bury their differences and forge a common alliance for the victory of the PDP in Plateau and to save Nigeria from APC’s maladministration.” The governor noted that rebuilding the PDP was a critical task all members should be focused on. “If the party is united, we are sure of coasting home in 2023, not just in Plateau State but also in the national election”, he added. Ex-House of Representatives Deputy Speaker, Chibudom Nwuche, Timi Alaibe, Lee Maeba, among others were on Wike’s entourage.
