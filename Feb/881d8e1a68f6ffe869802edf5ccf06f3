The bye-election for the Akure North/South Federal Constituency, on Saturday, witnessed a large turnout of voters. In most of the polling units visited by DAILY POST across the two local governments where the election is taking place, the electorate came out en masse to cast their votes for their preferred candidate. At some units in cathedral axis of Akure South Local Government, most of the electorate arrived before the arrival of the personnel from the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC.  The situation was not different in most units in Akure South Local Government, as well as in Oba-Ile axis of Akure North Local Government Area of the State. Meanwhile, in some units within the two local governments, voting materials were yet to arrive as at press time. INEC had earlier cleared seven political parties to participate in the bye-election.  Following the death of the legislator representing the constituency, late Hon Adedayo Omolafe of the PDP, in August 2021, the seat of the Akure South/Akure North Federal Constituency became vacant in the National Assembly.
