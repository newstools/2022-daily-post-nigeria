The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), has called on the federal government to implement the agreement it signed with the union. The University lecturers made the call in a statement signed by Chairman and Secretary of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Drs. Biodun Olaniran and Toyin Abegunrin. The union issued the statement shortly after the union’s monthly congress on Monday. It said the union was tired of the insincerity of the Mohammadu Buhari administration. The union alleged that Buhari has failed to fully implement the agreements reached with its members. ASUU LAUTECH said staff members have resolved to embark on an indefinite strike. They added that this was necessary since the government was not ready to do the needful. “Our Union, ASUU, is using this medium to call upon the Federal Government (FG) of Nigeria once again to implement the agreement it (FG) has signed with ASUU. “It is unfortunate to mention that the FG signed an agreement with the ASUU since 2009 but the agreement has not been implemented to date. The agreement was renegotiated in the name of peace. “But to our dismay, the government has refused to sign the renegotiated agreement. “In order to make the implementation of the agreement easy for the FG, the union has limited its demand to only three”.
