Manchester United interim boss, Ralf Rangnick, has explained why he left out Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford from his starting XI against Watford. The four England players were left on the bench for the Premier League clash at Old Trafford. Anthony Elanga, who scored the vital equaliser against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League in midweek, started against the Hornets, Alex Telles, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Nemanja Matic also made the starting XI. Discussing his selection decisions, Rangnick told United club media: “It’s our third game in six days, we only came back very late Thursday night. “So it was about fresh people, fresh energy, fresh legs and also a little bit due to the things that we need tactically against this team. “We have to control the game in possession and at the same time make sure that they don’t get transitional moments – this is their biggest weapon and this is the way that they try to play.”
