Gunmen had invaded Ikot Ekpa Cottage hospital, Mkpat Enin Local government area of Akwa Ibom State and abducted one Dr Felix Ekpo, a senior medical officer who was on duty. The Secretary of the State chapter of the Nigeria Medical Association, Dr. Ekem Emmanuel John, who announced this in a statement issued to journalists in Uyo, on Wednesday, said the incident happened on Tuesday. While urging the members to remain calm and alert in their duty post, the association said it was in contact with relevant security agencies in the State to ensure safety and unconditional release of the abducted doctor. The association also urged the State Government to look into the matter, threatening to down tools if the victim was not released within 48hours. “To this end, we humbly request the Government to deploy all of its rich security machinery towards the urgent and critical task of rescuing Dr Ekpo, who is not only a citizen but also an employee of Government, kidnapped in the line of duty, right at his place of duty, as assigned to him by Government,” the statement added.
