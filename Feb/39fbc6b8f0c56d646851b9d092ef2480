Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, has asked why DCP Abba Kyari has not yet been arrested and jailed by President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. DAILY POST reported that the NDLEA spokesperson, Femi Babafemi at a press briefing in Abuja on Monday, chronicled how Kyari belonged to a drug cartel that operates the Brazil-Ethiopia-Nigeria illicit drug route. Recall that Kyari was suspended over his alleged involvement with an international fraudster, Ramon Abass, popularly known as Hushpuppi. The former Intelligence Response Team, IRT, boss was alleged to have benefitted from a heist carried out by Hushpuppi and his gang in Dubai. He, however, denied involvement in Hushpuppi’s fraudulent activities. But in the latest development, NDLEA said there is evidence linking Kyari to a drug cartel that operates the Brazil-Ethiopia-Nigeria illicit drug pipeline. The agency later released a video linking the Police officer to the drug trafficking cartel, adding that the DCP needs to answer questions that came up in an ongoing drug case in which he is the principal actor. And Omokri recalled in a tweet on Monday that “Under President Obasanjo, Nuhu Ribadu arrested and handcuffed Tafa Balogun, the then Inspector General of Police, who was Yoruba like Obj, and threw him in jail.” He wondered “What is so special about DCP Abba Kyari that he is not yet in jail and is still even attending parties?”
