A Rivers State High Court sitting in Port Harcourt has granted an application for amendment of court processes by counsel to residents of Diobu Waterfronts whose properties were demolished by the state government. The properties along the Illoabuchi waterfronts in Diobu Port Harcourt City Local Government Area of Rivers State were demolished two weeks ago. The demolition followed a directive by Governor Wike that shanties in parts of the state be demolished as part of measures to fight insecurity. At the start of the demolition exercise, the occupants of the waterfronts through their counsel approached the court, seeking for an order to stop the government from going ahead to demolish the properties. When the matter came up in court on Friday, counsel to the plaintiffs filed an application asking the court for amendment of the processes which the court granted. The judge Justice S.H Aprioku after granting the order adjourned till the 28th of February, 2022 for mention. The judge also warned the plaintiffs against making further comments in the media concerning the matter. Counsel plaintiff after the court proceedings informed his clients that the application for amendment of court processes was to seek compensation for victims of the demolition since the action has already been concluded.
