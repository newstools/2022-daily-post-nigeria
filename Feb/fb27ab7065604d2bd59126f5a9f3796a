Indigenes of Abba community have accused the Police in Anambra State of abducting their President General, Mr Alex Ekwuagana. They claim that Ekwuagana was abducted on the instigation of a billionaire oil magnate, in a neighbouring community, Ukpo. Abba and Ukpo communities have been at loggerheads, over a disputed parcel of land for many years running. Mr Tiger Onyike, an indigene of Abba community who raised the alarm over the abduction of Ekwuagana alleged he was abducted by Mr Patrick Agbazue, the Commander of Rapid Response Squad in Awkuzu on the orders of the Commissioner of Police in Anambra state. He said: “This is still part of the intimidation orchestrated a long time ago. The Commander of Rapid Response Squad Awkuzu, Mr Patrick Emeka Agbazue and current Commissioner of Police Anambra State, Mr Echeng Eworo Echeng are all contractors hired to intimidate the people of Abba with abductions and detentions in order for Abba to abandon their ancestral land and run away. “They claimed that Mr Alex Ekwuagana, the President General of Abba Town Union jumped bail, but all were lies. The President General is a director in the Auditor General’s office in Anambra State, who could easily be invited to any police station.” Onyike said it was not true that the police was trying to enforce a Supreme Court judgment. “If they think police is enforcing a judgement, let them show us the copy of the judgement they’re enforcing. the Police know the truth but rather choose to work for money,” he said. When DAILY POST reached the spokesperson of the Anambra State Police Command, DSP Toochukwu Ikenga, he said he had knowledge of the matter, promising to make a press release to the effect. As of the time of filing this story, no reaction has been made in respect of the allegation.
