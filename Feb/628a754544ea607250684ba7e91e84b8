Justice I.R Minakiri of a Rivers State High Court has withdrawn from a matter instituted by one Ogechi Ogwu-Edwin and three others against the All Progressives Congress and the former Caretaker Committee Chairman of APC, Isaac Ogbobula. Justice Minakiri also withdrew from a similar suit by one Alaibo Soibibo and three others against the APC and Isaac Ogbobula. This comes after he adjourned the suits whose plaintiffs are seeking an interlocutory injunction against the APC and the conduct of congresses. The judge had fixed the 15th and 23rd of February respectively for judgment on the suits after parties argued and adopted their written addresses in the matters. Justice Minakiri summoned the parties on Tuesday and informed them of her resolve to send back the case files to the registrar of the court following a petition and series of calls she received since after the last adjournment. With the latest development, the matters are expected to be re-assigned to a new judge and will begin afresh.
