Senator Uche Ekwunife, on Wednesday, turned down a comment suggesting she would defeat former Anambra Governor, Peter Obi, at the polls. The Senate Committee Chairman Science and Technology responded to a tweet by a user, Theo Abu. “Peter Obi can’t beat Senator Uche Ekwunife in a free, fair and credible election in the South-East. “This is practical politics and it does not care about your feelings. Politics is local”, he tweeted. Abu’s view generated hundreds of reactions that got the lawmaker’s attention. “His Excellency, Mr. @PeterObi is one of Nigeria’s most refined politicians – Anambra’s number one export to the world. “He is my political leader. A leader with whom I am well pleased!”, Ekwunife replied. The member of the 9th Senate represents Anambra Central Senatorial District. Regarded as one of the active legislators, she was formerly in the House of Representatives. Ekwunife, 51, was one of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship aspirants in 2021. The politician came third in the June 26 primary and was later appointed Director-General of the party’s campaign. PDP candidate, Valentine Ozigbo, lost to All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) flagbearer, Charles Soludo in the November 6 election.
