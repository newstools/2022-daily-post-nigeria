Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand has heavily criticised the team after their unconvincing display against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League round of sixteen on Wednesday. Anthony Elanga came off the bench to equalise for the Red Devils late in the game, with United looking totally disorganised in the first half. The win put the Red Devils in a better chance ahead of the second leg coming up three weeks later. “Look, Man United would have taken that result before the game,” Ferdinand said on BT Sport. “But they were lucky tonight. They were poor in the way they played, the first half was really poor. “But when you talk about football at this level, you often ask, ‘can you weather the storm and stay in the game?’ “For as bad as United played, David de Gea didn’t have much to do. You wanted a better performance but they’ve got a result,” he said.
