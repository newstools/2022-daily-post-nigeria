Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has heaped praise on Tottenham manager Antonio Conte. Both managers and their teams will clash in the Premier League this Saturday with City leading the race for this season’s title. Guardiola, who addressed the press on Friday, said that Conte, a former Italy national team boss, has taught him a lot in football. “I learn a lot watching his teams, the movement, the club rely on him 100% and his ideas,” Guardiola said when asked about Conte. “He showed in Juventus and changed many things, at Milano, at Chelsea. If the club rely on him 100% they will have success. “In my first season it was tough against him. To be there for a long time in this country, he can talk about it. We know how difficult this country is. “He’s a manager, even the national team, how they play is fantastic. I have incredible respect because when I watch his teams I learn something new.” Conte has managed Juventus, Chelsea, Inter Milan before joining Tottenham a few months ago and he’s hoping to help the club qualify for the Champions League next season. Before joining Spurs, Conte led Inter Milan to the Serie A title last season and was about to be appointed as Manchester United manager.
