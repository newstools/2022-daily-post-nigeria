Arsenal legend, Ian Wright has tipped West Ham to finish in fourth place ahead of Arsenal, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur. Wright made this prediction despite the Gunners’ 1-0 win at Wolves on Thursday. Gabriel Magalhaes scored the only goal as Arsenal moved into fifth place with 39 points, one less than West Ham. However, Mikel Arteta’s men have played two games less. Still, Wright feels the Hammers will get the last Champions League spot. “‘That was a very, very good performance in respects of digging in and getting a result and now all Arsenal need to do is continue what they’re doing, nick a few more goals and see if you can stay amongst it. “There are people who are slipping up and that’s all you can do. Just win your games, if it’s 1-0 then it’s 1-0. If you go somewhere and you’re playing against the teams around you, as long as you don’t lose, you stay amongst it and that’s all Arsenal have to do now,” Wright told Premier League Productions. When asked which club is favourite to secure the fourth position, he replied: “I’ll say West Ham are favourites because West Ham are right there.”
