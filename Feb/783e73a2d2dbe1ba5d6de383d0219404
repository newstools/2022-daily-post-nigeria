Former Liverpool star, Danny Murphy, has slammed Manchester United for celebrating their Premier League 4-2 win over Leeds United last the weekend. Murphy said Man United celebrated their win over Leeds ‘like they had won the Premier League title’, adding that it is a shame. Man United resisted a Leeds comeback to beat Marcelo Bielsa’s men in a high-octane clash at Elland Road on Sunday. The result means Ralf Rangnick’s side have strengthened their grip on the fourth position in the Premier League table as they are now four points ahead of fifth-placed West Ham. But Murphy said Man United’s expectations ‘have got to be higher’. “The thing I can say about [Manchester] United is that this is how far they have come, and it is a shame because they are a brilliant club,” Murphy told talkSPORT. “But they were celebrating that win at Leeds – to cement fourth position for the time being – like they had won the title. “Ok, passion, emotion – I get it. But this is Man United. Ok, they are now in fourth. Well done boys, you have won at Leeds, who have conceded the second most goals in the Premier League. “They have spent the most money in the Premier League and they are celebrating fourth position and talking about, “A couple of months ago we would not have won this game”. Come on. “The expectations have got to be higher. I am just saying this thing that United have won two in a week and are now in fourth and everything is alright again – I don’t concur with that.” Man United’s next game is against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League on Wednesday.
