Wuhan in China has reported new positive cases for COVID-19, suspected to be the Omicron variant. Authorities in the capital of China’s Hubei Province confirmed 14 cases as of Tuesday afternoon. Those infected in 6 districts include 10 locals and 4 non-locals, Xinhua reports. Thirteen had attended a training session held by a company from Friday to Sunday. Li Tao, Deputy Secretary-General, Wuhan municipal government, said all have been sent to a hospital for treatment. An Independent Panel for Pandemic Readiness and Response had accused China and the World Health Organisation (WHO) of slow reaction. The team set up by WHO Director General Tedros Ghebreyesus released its report in January 2021. It was co-chaired by ex-Prime Minister of New Zealand Helen Clark and former President of Liberia Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. Clark said China could have been faster in its response, wondering why the discovery of 27 cases in Wuhan was made public one week after detection. “One question is whether it would have helped if WHO had used the word pandemic earlier than it did”, she said. The United Nations (UN) agency declared coronavirus a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
