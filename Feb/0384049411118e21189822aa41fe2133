Some people suspected to be hoodlums, on Saturday, reportedly stormed the Ibadan residence of Mr. Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho. DAILY POST gathered that the residence located at Soka area of Ibadan, was attacked by the hoodlums Saturday afternoon. Our correspondent gathered that one of the occupants of the building was killed. Several other people were injured during the attack. Sources told DAILY POST that the hoodlums also destroyed some property belonging to the Yoruba activist. All efforts made by DAILY POST to get a reaction from the Public Relations Officer of the state police command, Adewale Osifeso, were futile as calls put through his mobile phone were not successful. Similarly, efforts made to get a reaction from Yomi Alliyu, who is the lead counsel to Mr. Adeyemo also proved to be abortive as several calls to his phone were not answered while an SMS sent to him has not been replied as at the time of filing this report on Saturday. Our correspondent recalls that Adeyemo is one of the people championing the creation of Oduduwa Republic. Adeyemo’s residence, which was attacked on Saturday, had earlier been invaded by a team of Department of State Service. Two people were killed during the invasion of the house which took place on Thursday, July 1, 2021.
