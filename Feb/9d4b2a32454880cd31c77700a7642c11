The South African police have vowed to ensure the safety of Nigerians residing in the country, after the latest round of mob attacks that left a Nigerian, Nicholas John, dead. The police made the promise when the leadership of the Nigeria Union South Africa (NUSA), led by Mr Collins Mgbo, its President, met stakeholders at Kimberley district in Northern Cape, South Africa, where a Nigerian died, after a mob attack. Mgbo said in a statement from Pretoria on Sunday that the meeting was attended by Head of Kimberley Police Cluster, Brig. Rikhostso, the host community, representatives of religious organisations and the South African widow of late Mr John. John’s widow was identified as Ms. Caroline Chikoma, who is currently nursing a 4-month-old baby. Mgbo revealed that the aim of the meeting was to appeal to the police to ensure that justice was served in the tragic assault on John and for his killers to be brought to book. Mgbo said, “Secondly, the meeting was able to establish a structure or team, comprising the police, Nigerians, churches and other migrant community organisations. “The responsibility of this group is to make sure that information is sent across to the police whenever there is a crisis so that the police can handle the matter quickly before it gets out of control. “The police have promised the Nigerian community that they’ll make sure their lives and properties are protected.” On Feb. 17, Mgbo had announced the death of Nicholas John after attacks on foreigners by South African gangsters. He identified John as an indigene of Ogun State in the Southwest part of Nigeria, who made his living selling cars, in Kimberley district, South Africa.
