Former Nigeria head coach, Gernot Rohr has named Maduka Okoye as the best goalkeeper in the squad. Rohr installed the Sparta Rotterdam stopper as first choice during his time in charge before he was sacked in December. Augustine Eguavoen, who took over from the German on an interim basis, also chose to start with Okoye at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. Although Okoye was blamed for the goal that saw the Super Eagles bow out from the tournament in Cameroon, Rohr has kept to his defence. “He came in as fourth choice, but in 18 months he was first choice, after what he did at Sparta Rotterdam. His rise is phenomenal, so you can expect some occasional mistakes. He worked so hard to get to where he is now. You have to credit him. “They are very good goalkeepers in Nigeria, but Maduka has an edge, which is that he is a regular for a team in the Dutch league, where he was second best goalkeeper last year. “He is heading to Watford for a huge fee for an African goalkeeper of his age. I am proud of him,” Rohr told OwnGoalNigeria
