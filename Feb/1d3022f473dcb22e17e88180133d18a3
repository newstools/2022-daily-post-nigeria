Katsina State Government has announced the ban on the activities of “Yan Sa Kai” vigilante group, ordering their arrest by the police and other security agencies for their recalcitrant offences and extra judicial killings in the state. This was disclosed in a statement duly signed by the Special Adviser on Security Matters to the state government and made available to DAILY POST by the State Director General, Media, Abdul Labaran Malumfashi. According to the Special Adviser on Security Matters, Ibrahim Ahmed Katsina, with the ban, the police and security agencies are directed to ensure that all ‘Yan Sa Kai activities across the State are dismantled, noting that “henceforth, nobody should take the law into his hands, under whatever guise. Arrested suspects should be handed over to the Police or any security agency for proper investigation and action where need be.” Following the directives of the Katsina state government, the Katsina Command has directed “all its Commanders and Divisional Police Officer (DPOs) to go after the recalcitrant offenders and their sponsors wherever they are in the state and make sure they face the wrath of law.” The Command also warned “members of the public to disassociate themselves with the group and cooperate with security agencies,reporting any “Dansakai or Yansakai” within their domains. saying “the Command will not fold its arms while some disgruntled members of the public take laws into their hands, brazenly killing innocent citizens, destroying and looting public property without recourse to the rule of law.” According to the statement, henceforth “the Nigeria Police Force and indeed other sister security agencies will deal decisively with any person or group of persons found parading themselves as Yansakai or any other like name in the state.”
