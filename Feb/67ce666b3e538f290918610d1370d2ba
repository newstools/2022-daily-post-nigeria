The Osun Branch of the Federal Polytechnic Ede Alumni Association has asked the Osun State Police Command to bring the prime suspect in the killing of Hassan Adedeji, a prospective National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) member to justice. The association also condemned the killing of the prospective Corps member who was a Higher National Diploma graduate of the Department of Banking and Finance. He was gunned down, together with a commercial motorcyclist by a suspected cultist in the early hours of Thursday, February 10, 2022, at the Agbalemobode area of Ede. The killings sparked days of unrest as students went on rampage protesting the death, burning tyres and blocking major streets in the ancient town. Making the call Monday, the chairman of the association, Olorunfemi Olatunji Awoko, who described the incident as babaric and nauseating, charged the Osun State Commissioner of Police, Wale Olokode to thoroughly investigate the circumstances that led to the death and killing of the student, with a view to preventing further occurrence of such incidents. Lamenting that the aftermath of the killings was the unrest which the surrounding communities and Ede was thrown into, Awoko, who was a former student union president of the institution, also called on the police and other security agencies to step in and strengthen the security apparatus in the State so as to nip criminality in the bud. The student activist, while commending the police for taking action and arresting two of the suspected cultists, demanded that the police should intensify their efforts and get Rasheed Okoolu, the leader and prime suspect, who is still at large, arrested.
