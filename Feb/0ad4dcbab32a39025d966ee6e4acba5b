The Imo State Commander, Ernest Ogbu who disclosed this in a release issued in Owerri, the state capital, said the victims, comprising four females and eight males were intercepted by the operatives of the Nigerian Navy on patrol at Akachi junction, Owerri on 13th February 2022. The release said,” Teenagers aged between 20 to 15 years of age hail from Akwa Ibom and Cross River State respectively. ” Upon interview and further interrogation, it was gathered that one of the victims was indeed a suspect and not a victim as he was responsible for the procurement of some of the victims. “Most of them claimed to have lost their parents and are now left in the care of their brother who gave them hope of working in a cocoa plantation and provision shops. “Investigation into the case is ongoing as the Imo State Commander, Mr Ernest Ogbu appreciates the efforts of the Nigerian Navy and quick intervention in the case as well the Nigerian Immigration Service for the synergy in profiling the victims.”
