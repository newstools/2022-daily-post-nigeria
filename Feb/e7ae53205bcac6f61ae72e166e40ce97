The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arraigned Olalekan Mutholib on a five-count charge bordering on obtaining $100,909 by false pretence. Mutholib, under trial before Justice Nicholas Oweibo of the Federal High in Ikoyi, Lagos State, is also accused of N1,050,000 fraud. The defendant and accomplices claimed they possessed magical power to double $50,000 falsely obtained from one of their victims, Raji Babatunde. Mutholib and Nurudeen Gbolagade Rasheed, (at large) sometime in 2021, “knowingly conspired with others at large to obtain the sums of $50,000, $30,909.06, $20,000 and N1,050,000.60.” The offences contravene Section 8(a), 2(b) and Section 2(c) of the Advance Fee Fraud and other Fraud Related Offences Act 2006 of the Act. Mutholib pleaded not guilty to the charge when it was read to him. Bilikisu Buhari, prosecution counsel, asked the court for a trial date and prayed that the defendant be remanded in a correctional facility. The defence counsel, Oludare Adetoki, announced that he filed an application for bail. Justice Oweibo fixed March 1, 2022 to take arguments for and against the motion for bail. Mutholib will remain at a correctional centre until then.
