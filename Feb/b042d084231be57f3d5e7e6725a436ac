Former Asante Kotoko chairman, Herbert Mensah, has backed the Black Stars of Ghana to beat Nigeria and qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar later this year. Nigeria and Ghana will face each other in the final World Cup qualifying round in March, with the winner progressing to the 2022 FIFA World Cup slated for November this year. The West African giants were eliminated from the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, in Cameroon. Nigeria was eliminated from the round of 16, while Ghana didn’t make it past the group stage after losing to Comoros. However, Mensah is optimistic Ghana will overcome the Super Eagles. “We need to look and build, say this was a disaster, we have Nigeria next, and we have a country that traditionally we beat or we frustrate,” Mensah was quoted by Complete Sport as saying. “Do we have what it takes to beat Nigeria? I think we do.”
