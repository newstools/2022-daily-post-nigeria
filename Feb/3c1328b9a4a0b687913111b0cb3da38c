Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has threatened to depose the newly installed king of Akpor Kingdom in Obio Akpor local government area of the state over activities of illegal oil refinery operators in his domain. The governor said he will not hesitate to remove the king if he fails to stop illegal oil bunkering in his kingdom. The Governor made the threat on Friday while presenting certificates of recognition to two royal fathers. His Royal Majesty, Nne-Nwe-Eli Emohua XIII, Ohna Sergeant Chidi Awuse and His Royal Majesty, Nye Nwe Ali Akpor, Eze Ozuowuowu Levi Amos Orlu Oriebe received their staff of office at the Government House, Port Harcourt. The Governor said the war against artisanal refineries must be sustained. He also frowned at the king of Omerelu community in Ikwerre Local Government Area where he said illegal oil bunkering activities are thriving. Wike said apart from the soot issue and the sabotage against the economy created by oil bunkering, the internal roads being constructed in the communities have been damaged by the activities of oil bunkering operators. “We are doing internal roads in Omerelu. This is a community that has been crying for roads and we have given them not less than 11/12 kilometres of internal roads and now they’re spoiling it because of the conveyance of oil products. We can’t continue to accept that. I can’t understand why you just want to collect the chieftaincy title and do nothing.” Governor Wike, however, advised the two kings presented with their staff of office to ensure that peace reigns in their various domains.
