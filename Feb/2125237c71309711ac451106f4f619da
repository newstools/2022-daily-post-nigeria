A popular rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, has claimed that Bola Tinubu, an All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential aspirant, was flown to London in an air ambulance. Sowore claimed that Tinubu fled to London after he noticed that his presidential ambition was dead on arrival. Tinubu recently informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his intention to contest in the 2023 presidential election. The former governor of Lagos State, however, said he was consulting with relevant stakeholders across the country. But, last week, the APC National Leader traveled to London, where he is running his presidential campaign. Dismissing Tinubu’s claim, Sowore, in a Facebook post, wrote: “Three weeks ago you would think the election had been decided when Jagaban of Corruption, Bola Tinubu “declared” his intention to run but soon as he discovered that his ambition was dead on arrival, he took his ambulance and fled to London!.”
