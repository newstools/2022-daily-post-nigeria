Tragedy struck on Monday as gunmen kidnapped 10 people at the Ajaokuta rail station in Kogi State. The incident, according to sources, happened at about 2 pm. It was also gathered that the gunmen, who were kitted with fire arms also opened fire on a man identified as Dennis and killed him instantly. DAILY POST source revealed that late Dennis was on his way to pick his boss from work before he met his untimely death. DAILY POST further learnt that the gunmen who came in commando-style whisked their victims to an unknown destination. A source in Ajaokuta said the kidnappers have contacted one of their victims’ families and demanded a N20 million ransom. A resident of Ajaokuta, Dele Ajala said, “the latest kidnap has plunged some of the victim’s family into sorrow. This just goes to show how insecure the country is. There is a need to reinforce the state with adequate police officers to counter this kind of issue. Robbery and kidnapping have now become legal business in the country. “It is appalling to see people fall victim to kidnapping on daily basis. This shows that the people cannot trust their government to secure them anymore”. When contacted, the Kogi State Police Public Relations Officer, William Ovye Aya, said the command is yet to be briefed about the incident. He however promised to reach out to our correspondent as soon as he gets information about the incident. DAILY POST recalls that in January 2022, four people were also kidnapped while returning home from a naming ceremony in Yagba West Local Government Area of Kogi State.
