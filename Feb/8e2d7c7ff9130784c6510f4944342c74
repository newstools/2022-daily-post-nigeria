Senegal forward, Sadio Mane has said they deserved to beat Burkina Faso and qualify for the final of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. The Teranga Lions scored three goals in the last 20 minutes of their semi-final clash on Wednesday. Abdou Diallo stabbed home from close range in the 70th minute for the first, before Bamba Dieng made it 2-0 six minutes later. Blati Toure pulled one back in the 82nd minute, but Mane sealed the win with a breakaway goal. Senegal, who finished as runners-up in the 2019 last edition, will face hosts Cameroon or Egypt in the final. “We knew it would not be easy, it was a semi-final of the Cup of Nations after all. “And we were up against a good Burkina Faso team who gave us a lot of problems. “We were calm and we took our opportunities and I think we deserved this victory,” Mane said after the game.
