The Leader Of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, on Thursday, said the Yoruba race may not get the 2023 presidency, despite having sellable and credible aspirants. In a statement released by his Media Aide, Osho Oluwatosin, Primate Ayodele revealed that God has shown him that the presidency may elude the Yorubas due to the spirit of discordance among stakeholders of the race. Primate Ayodele noted that Yorubas don’t struggle to get things but the 2023 presidency will be a different ball game because of the spirit of disunity in the race. He further affirmed that neither Tinubu nor Vice President Yemi Osinbajo will get it if the race isn’t united. According to Ayodele: ‘’Yoruba should shun quarrel otherwise, presidency will elude the Yoruba race. The Lord has told me that Yoruba presidency is under threat, it will elude them except they immediately work against it. They need to come together so they can get something, Yoruba presidency is shaking, and that’s what I see. ‘’The Yorubas have credible candidates but the northerners are watching, Yorubas don’t struggle for things but there is a spirit of discordance amidst the credible candidates hereby causing serious quarrel, it is seriously shaking. ‘’Tinubu or Osinbajo may not get the presidency if they don’t appease the forefathers of Yoruba. This is beyond consultation of humans, they need serious God’s directive otherwise Yorubas will lose presidency.’’
