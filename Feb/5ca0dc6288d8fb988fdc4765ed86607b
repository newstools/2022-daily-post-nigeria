The leadership of the Taraba State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described the recent defection of the Senate Deputy Minority Leader, Emmanuel Bwacha, from the party to the All Progressives Congress (APC), as a blessing in disguise. Bwacha, who represents Taraba South in the Senate, was received into the APC by President Muhammadu Buhari and the APC’s Caretaker Chairman, Mai Mala Buni, at the State House in Abuja Speaking with DAILY POST on Thursday, the party’s spokesperson in the state, Andeta’rang Irammae, said the senator “left the party alone and not with the party’s supporters.” Irammae noted that the people he (Bwacha) draws his power from did not decamp with him to the opposition party, adding that his defection will not affect PDP in the state. He added that Bwacha’s exit from the PDP would further strengthen the party. While calling on the party’s supporters to remain steadfast as the senator’s exit from the party will not hinder the party from triumphing in the forthcoming general elections, the leadership of the party, he said, will not cease from ensuring internal democracy.
