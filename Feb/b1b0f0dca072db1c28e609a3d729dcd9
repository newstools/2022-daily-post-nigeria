Reno Omokri, a socio-political activist, has suggested that President Muhammadu Buhari is against the much clamoured Igbo presidency. Omokri wondered why the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, would file fresh corruption charges against an All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential aspirant, Rochas Okorocha, on the same day he declared his intention to run for the presidency. EFCC had filed a N2.9 billion corruption charge against Okorocha, stressing that he misappropriated the money when he was the governor of Imo State. In a series of tweets, the former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan wondered why EFCC had not arrested Bola Tinubu, another presidential aspirant after he declared. Omokri stressed that the anti-graft agency’s action was an indication of bias against Igbos. The socio-political activist said EFCC should charge Tinubu if it does the same to Okorocha. He wrote: “The fact that the EFCC filed fresh 2.9 billion charges against Okorocha the same day he declared his interest to contest the 2023 Presidential election is not a coincidence. It is a sign to Ndi’Igbo by General Buhari that he does not believe in Igbo Presidency! “Why does it have to be the same day? This is obviously a message. Tinubu declared. Why had the EFCC not charged him? We wrote a petition against Tinubu over his clear breach of the Money Laundering Act with his infamous bullion vans. Why charge Okorocha and not Tinubu? “I have my own preferred candidate. But I can’t ignore this obvious bias against Ndi’Igbo. If the EFCC charges Okorocha, then they must charge Tinubu!”
