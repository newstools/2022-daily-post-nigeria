Nollywood Actor, Yul Edochie, has called for the release of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Edochie, in a tweet via his Twitter handle on Wednesday while seeking the release of Kanu, called for dialogue. He tweeted: “Release Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and call for dialogue. “In a multi-tribal country like Nigeria, there’ll always be agitation from different quarters. “To keep the country united you should listen to your people, know why they’re agitating and resolve it peacefully. Not by the use of force.” Meanwhile, Nnamdi Kanu, at the hearing in court today, complained that he was going blind and pleaded with the Judge to rescue him. Kanu disclosed that the Department of State Services, DSS, took away his glasses since his arrest. He also asked the court to dismiss the charges against him on the grounds that the alleged offences were not committed in Nigeria. The Biafra leader claimed that no prima facie has been made against him by the federal government throughout the proof of evidence in support of the charges.
