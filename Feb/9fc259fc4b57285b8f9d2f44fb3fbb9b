Governor Samuel Ortom has expressed confidence that the council elections in the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Abuja would be a walkover for the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, due to the abysmal performance of the All Progressives Congress, APC, stressing that the PDP’s anticipated victory will be a good signal towards the 2023 general elections. DAILY POST reports that elections into the six Area Councils in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja have been scheduled to hold on Saturday, February 12, 2022. The Governor, who spoke with journalists on Wednesday, in Abuja after presiding over a meeting of the PDP campaign committee council for the Abuja elections, expressed confidence that the opposition party would clear the poll. Governor Ortom said what was left for them as a party was to work hard and be vigilant against any attempt to disrupt the election, pointing out that the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC has given the party assurance to conduct a transparent and free election, saying the party has confidence in the electoral umpire. The Governor called on stakeholders of the party to make sacrifices for the success of the party in the council elections. While restating the belief of the PDP in fairness, justice and equity, Governor Ortom however warned that any attempt to rig the election and shortchange the party will be met with stiff resistance. FCT PDP Leader and Senate Minority Whip, Senator Philip Aduda was optimistic of the party’s landslide victory in the six area councils. He boasted that the PDP had done it before and would do it again come this Saturday. He, however, said there was the need for them to be vigilant to protect their votes, warning that the influx of some people into the FCT as the election approached has created suspicion.
