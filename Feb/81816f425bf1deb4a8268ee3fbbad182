Reports from Mandaragirau Village in southern Borno indicates that fighters from the Islamic State for West African Province, ISWAP abducted three people in the early hours of Saturday. The three young men abducted are Yamta Usman, Hamidu Adamu Chiroma and Mustapha Adamu Chiroma also known as Lingi. Sources told DAILY POST, “We woke up to this shocker. The last time this kind of episode happened here was when they went to the market and pick someone. But that one we learnt that they suspected him to be an informant for the soldiers. ” For these young men, we are suspecting that the ISWAP may be out to take young men to forcefully conscript them into their ranks. ISWAP recently have been recruiting young men from villages around the southern Borno axis.” He said. Another resident told DAILY POST that it was rather unbelievable to see happenings like this when the news making the round indicated that the military was dealing decisively with the ISWAP elements. ” If something like this will continue to happen in the face of the ongoing stories and promises, then we do not know who to trust or believe anymore. I was devastated to receive the message very early in the morning that ISWAP came to our village and took with them some young men. “This is sad. We have not received any news regarding why they were taken. We are all praying for them to return safely. But I am equally afraid of the happening especially these days with such reports of abduction and current recruitment by the ISWAP. ” He said
