A Madrid court on Thursday declared former Barcelona striker, Samuel Eto’o, as the biological father of a 22-year-old Spanish woman, Erika Do Rosario Nieves. Eto’o declared himself in absentia and did not attend to the evidence presented against him in court. This has been indicated to EFE by lawyer Fernando Osuna, who was in charge of the legal representation of Nieves’ lawsuit in 2018. Nieves’ mother and Eto’o met, according to the lawsuit, in a Madrid nightclub in 1997, when the Cameroon legend was on loan at Leganes. The mother disclosed that, during the pregnancy, she tried to communicate with the former Chelsea attacker, but he did not answer her phone calls or emails. She provided biological evidence that supported her testimony, which made the judge admit the claim, although Eto’o never met the court’s requirements. Eto’o must now pay Nieves 1,400 euros per month, including retroactive payments since the lawsuit was filed.
