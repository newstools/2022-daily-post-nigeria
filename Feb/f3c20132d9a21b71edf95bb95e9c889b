Arsenal legend, Paul Merson has compared striker Pierre Emerick Aubameyang’s behaviour ahead of his move to Barcelona to former Super Eagles forward, Peter Odemwingie’s failed move to QPR in 2013. Aubameyang finally sealed a move to Barcelona on transfer deadline day, but the buildup to the deal was full of drama. The Gabon captain completed a free transfer to Barcelona from Arsenal just before the January transfer window closes on Monday night. However, before the deal was agreed between Arsenal and Barcelona, Aubameyang had travelled to Spain without the Gunners’ permission, which Merson found funny. Merson compared the situation to that of Odemwingie, whose behaviour on the deadline day of January 2013 was the headline of that transfer window. Odemwingie had driven down all the way from West Brom to QPR in London with the intention to sign for the club. But he was denied entry after West Brom released a statement that they had not agreed to a deal with QPR, and Odemwingie had not been given permission to speak with the club. It is similar to what Aubameyang did, although the former Dortmund attacker eventually completed his move to Barcelona. “That is like Odemwingie going down to Loftus Road and saying I am just going down for a takeaway,” Merson said on Skysports.
