Four people have been arrested for illegal gold mining by operatives of the Ondo State Security Network dubbed Amotekun Corps in the state.
The illegal miners, who were nabbed on Thursday, were taken to the headquarters of Amotekun, Alagbaka, Akure for interrogation. Obe Rasaq Ayodele, the Ondo State Commissioner for Mines, Energy, and Mineral Resources, confirmed this while speaking on activities of the illegal miners in the state. The illegal miners were said to have been spotted in the hilly terrain around Owena Igbara Oke, Ifedore Local Government Area. The commissioner said “Illegal miners were detected around Owena Igbara Oke. They wreaked havoc on cash crops and fields. “They had escaped before we could arrive. However, we were fortunate in that we were able to identify a few individuals who admitted to carrying out the actions.
“They are providing vital information to Amotekun. They were largely gold miners.”
