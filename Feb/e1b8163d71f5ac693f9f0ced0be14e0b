FIFA has suspended Kenya and Zimbabwe for government interference, according to Gianni Infantino, the president of the world football governing body. Infantino revealed this at a press conference on Thursday. Kenya’s Ministry of Sports in November 2021, suspended the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) and appointed a caretaker committee to take charge of soccer activities in the country. In Zimbabwe, the country’s federation was also suspended by the Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) in November 2021. “We had to suspend two of our members; Kenya and Zimbabwe, both for government interference in the activities of football associations. The associations are suspended with immediate effect,” Infantino said. “They know what needs to be done for them to be readmitted or for their suspensions to be lifted.”
