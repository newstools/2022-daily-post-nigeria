The trial of Golden Tulip Hotel Chief Executive Officer, Amaechi Ndili, is yet to commence, seven years after it was instituted. The case stalled again on Wednesday at an Ikeja Special Offences Court in Lagos State. The court ordered that the file be returned to the Office of the Chief Judge for reassignment. Justice Sherifat Solebo gave the order after explaining she was approaching retirement, NAN reports. Ndili, 52, is also the Managing Director of Lionstone Offshore Services Ltd. Njide Ndili, a co-defendant and Lionstone Vice-President, was absent. The duo and their company are to be arraigned on a three-count charge bordering on conspiracy and stealing. Defence counsel, Ebun Sofunde (SAN), told the court that Njide was in a hospital and presented a medical certificate. But prosecution counsel, ACP Simon Lough (SAN), argued that it was a ploy to frustrate commencement of the trial. Lough said the certificate presented by defence contravened Section 198 of Administration of Criminal Law of Lagos State. Section 198 stipulates that a medical certificate presented in court should be from a government hospital. But Solebo held that the law does not apply since the trial had yet to begin and advised parties to take the case to another judge. The defendants committed the alleged offences between July 2012 and September 2013. The police say they converted to their personal use, $4.6million received from Addax Petroleum Development Nigeria Ltd. on behalf of Hercules Offshore Nigeria Ltd. The alleged offences contravene Sections 387 and 516 of the Criminal Code, Law, Cap C38, Laws of the Federation, 2004.
