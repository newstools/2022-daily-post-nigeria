Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick has insisted he has no plans to remove Harry Maguire as captain of the team. Rangnick stated this on Monday during a press conference ahead of their Premier League game against Brighton today. The German was responding to calls for Maguire to be replaced as skipper following a series of poor performances. But Rangnick said: “Maguire is our captain and I don’t see any reason to change that. “He is also a player who has to develop and get better like all the other players”. Maguire was appointed as captain of the team by former manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. The 28-year-old has come under scrutiny since he completed a record £80million transfer from Leicester City in 2019.
