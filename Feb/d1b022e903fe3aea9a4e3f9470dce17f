Following the signing into law of the re-worked Electoral Act Amendment Bill by President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday, the Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Pastor Adewale Giwa, has stated that the move will not have any impact on the country’s political space. According to Giwa, the 2023 elections will be of no difference from the previous polls until the needful is done. The foremost pastor during an interview on Sunday in Akure, the Ondo State capital, said a referendum must be conducted to properly address Nigeria’s problems. “Nobody is coming to change anything in Nigeria, unless we restructure our system. “Also, the political leaders led by President Muhammadu Buhari should as a matter of urgency call for a referendum to know the grievances of Nigeria. “He must also find a way to put aside the 1999 constitution and allow the citizens determine what they want. “The electoral bill signed by the president will not make any difference. They signed a bill that will favour them and to give Nigerian politicians what they want. We need to go back to option A4 electoral system that will make the votes of the electorate count. “As it is, if Nigeria goes ahead with the 2023 elections without the aforementioned solution, nothing absolutely is going to change.”
