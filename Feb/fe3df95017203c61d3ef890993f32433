Paris Saint-Germain has been handed a major boost ahead of their Champions League round of 16 first-leg tie against Real Madrid on February 15. Neymar who has been out of action for over two months after he was stretchered off with an ankle injury during PSG’s 3-1 victory over Saint-Etienne on November 28, returned to training. The Brazilian was pictured laughing and joking alongside his teammates, including Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe, during their training ahead of PSG’s Ligue 1 tie against Rennes on Friday. Neymar, however, will not be fit for PSG’s match against Rennes, four days before the Real Madrid clash, PSG coach Mauricio Pochettino said on Thursday during his pre-match press conference. “He will not be in the squad for Rennes,” Pochettino said, adding that the player was back training with the first-team squad. Neymar will have to prove his fitness to feature against Real Madrid next Tuesday. Neymar’s injury back in November caused major concerns as he fell to the ground and immediately called for medical attention after a challenge from Yvann Macon.
