The Police Service Commission has issued two weeks ultimatum to the Nigeria Police to conclude investigations on the case involving the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari. The development was contained in a statement issued on Friday by the Head, Press and Public Relations of the Commission, Ikechukwu Ani. The Commission also directed the police to ensure that the investigation is carried out by a different panel. The directive is sequel to the Commission’s 14th plenary meeting in Abuja, chaired by retired Inspector-General of Police and Chairman of the Commission, Musiliu Smith. Recall that Mr Kyari was suspended on August 1, 2021, following recommendations by Inspector General of Police, Usma Baba over his alleged ties with fraudster, Ramon Abbas, popularly called Hushpuppi. The suspension followed a report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the United States of America which indicted Kyari in the case of fraud involving the Instagram celebrity, Hushpuppi. Kyari, until his suspension by the commission, was the officer-in-charge of the Inspector-General of Police Intelligence Response Team.
