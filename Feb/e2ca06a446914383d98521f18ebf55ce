Nigerian activist Charles Oputa, aka Charly Boy, has advised ladies to stop seeking ready-made husbands and start being supportive. In an Instagram post, Charly Boy said that ladies must be able to offer more than sex and start supporting their men in other areas of life. According to him, most relationships are cut short nowadays because many ladies only have sex to offer in their relationships and nothing more. He said: “Many girls complain that guys walk away from them simply because they refused to give them sex. Some girls have even turned into sex toys just to keep a man. Let me be very open here, sex might not be the reason these guys walk away. “Remove sex from a relationship and you’ll see that most girls do not have anything else to offer their man. ” Aside from sex, what do you have to offer to a man. Can you support him spiritually? Can you support him physically and financially? How about mentally?” He urged ladies to stop spending unnecessarily on material things and plan for the future with their partners. “All you girls do is demand money for bags, shoes, phones, clothes, and outings. Making him spend unnecessarily. What are you even bringing to the table? “Have you ever sat him down and helped him plan for his future. Try to be a woman that a man will always regret losing for the rest of his life. “Be that woman that your man can’t afford to lose to another man. Build your man to your taste and stop looking for a ready-made husband when you’re not a ready-made wife,” he added.
