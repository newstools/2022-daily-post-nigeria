The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said the nation now has an Electoral Act 2022, which replaced the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended). This followed the signing into law of the Electoral Bill by President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday. The commission, in a statement by Barrister Festus Okoye, the National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education, said that given the tight timelines contained in the new law, the commission fully appreciates the importance of proceeding with their implementation in earnest, adding that an extraordinary meeting of the COMMISSION has been scheduled to hold on Saturday February 26, in order to discuss on the way forward. According to him, the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and the new Act will now constitute the principal law to govern the conduct of future elections, including the 2023 General Election.
