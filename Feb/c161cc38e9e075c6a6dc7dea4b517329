Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has endorsed the presidential ambition of Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Ganduje said the entire North was behind Tinubu’s 2023 presidential ambition. He said the time was ripe for the North to pay back Tinubu for supporting President Muhammadu Buhari. The Governor spoke on Monday at the inauguration of an office for Northern Youth Professionals for Tinubu in Kano. Represented by the Managing Director of Kano Road Traffic Agency, Dr. Baffa Babba Dan’agundi, the Governor assured that Tinubu has the backing of the North. “Northern Nigeria has no option but to support the Yoruba race and Tinubu. If I ask you to give the name of one person who supported the Northern candidature of Muhammadu Buhari, it will be Tinubu. “It is time for us to show whether we are truly sons of our parents or not. This is the time and we are with Bola Ahmed Tinubu. “His Excellency, Dr. Abdullahi Ganduje is part and parcel of this struggle, so we’re with Bola Ahmed Tinubu. “It was Tinubu who persistently stood firm and ensured that the people of the South-West supported Buhari from the APC primary up to the presidential election where he was victorious,” he said. Tinubu recently declared his intention to run for the presidency in 2023.
