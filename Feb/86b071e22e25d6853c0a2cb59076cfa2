An agricultural expert, Professor James Adediran has said climate change is threatening food production and supply in the country. The professor of soil science disclosed this during a workshop at the Nigeria Institute of Soil Science (NISS) South-West zone for extension agents and farmers in the region. Adediran maintained that the effects of climate change are posing a serious challenge to agricultural systems including crops, livestock, forestry and fisheries. He added that the effects of climate change vary from region, country and location, advising farmers to adopt new methods of agriculture such as irrigation to reduce the effects of climate change in the country. He said, “The effects of Climate Change has therefore posed a serious challenge to agricultural systems including crops, livestock, forestry and fisheries. “Soil is part of our environment and it is a vital factor for agricultural production. Climate change has been found to adversely affect the productivity of the soil. “Some areas are expected to become drier and more drought-prone, while others will witness more intense rains or altered rainfall patterns. Increasing temperatures will change the length of the growing seasons and affect yield in some areas, while at the same time modify the distribution of fish populations in rivers and oceans. “Therefore, the approach to mitigate or adapt to Climate Change requires site-specific strategies and responses. Also, for agricultural systems to sustainably contend with climate change, their contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions must also be addressed. “This can be done by involving all agricultural activities that will sustain productivity and reduce GHG emissions usually released in the atmosphere. “It is, therefore, necessary to find ways to meet these challenges, increase agricultural production and sustain food systems for affected regions, countries, locations and communities.
