The Rivers State Government has stepped up efforts in the fight against the operation of illegal refineries in the state, through the use of technology. The Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, on Thursday, took a presentation from the leadership of the Petroleum Retail Outlet Owners of Nigeria on a newly-developed technology called the Petroleum Products Passport and Petroleum Products Passport Seal, to be used in the fight against artisanal refineries in the state. The 3Ps and 3P seals developed by PETROAN and the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, are expected to work as “an electronic receipts” and automated seals for petroleum products purchased from legitimate sources. Speaking after the presentation, the Commissioner for Energy, Peter Medee, said the move was to “complement the effort of the state government in the fight against illegal refineries.” Explaining the function of the 3Ps, the commissioner said, “You are aware that it is until crude oil is stolen that they can do artisanal refining. “Presently, the Governor of Rivers State has been on the street and has spent a lot of money to directly confront these people doing artisanal refining. That is very good but that is a short-term approach. “Because, if the governor leaves tomorrow, the next government may not be that dogged enough to continue what Wike is doing. “That’s why we have come out with a medium and long-term solution that will completely solve this problem. And what is it expected to do? To take away the market completely from them. “The 3Ps is to ensure that a uniform ticket will be issued to all those who buy petroleum products in River State.” Also speaking, the National President of PETROAN, Billy Harry, said efforts are on to get petroleum marketers to sign up to the platform. Already, over one thousand filling stations have already signed up on the platform.
