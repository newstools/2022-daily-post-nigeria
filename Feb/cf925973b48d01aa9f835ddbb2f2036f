Kanye West has continued to call out his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian over the custody of his children. Recall that Kanye had days ago on Instagram complained about his daughter, North being active on TikTok. He sought for public opinion on how to keep his daughter who is just 8-year-old from the social media App till she’s old enough. He also called out Kim Kardashian about not feeling as if he has much control as a parent. The rapper in a recent Instagram post accused Kim of keeping their children from visiting his hometown despite agreement of a joint custody. He mentioned that he wants to take his kids to his hometown, Chicago, but Kim is stopping that from happening. Kanye also spoke about how his mother kept him away from his father, calling for inclusiveness of dads in their children’s lives. His post read: “I will no longer put my hand through blender to hug my children my mother took me to Chicago when I was 3 and told my dad if he came to Chicago he would never see me again. “I dream of a world where dads can still be heroes. “I want to bring my kids to my hometown of Chicago to see my basketball team play for 7000 people and Kim is stopping that. How is this joint custody?” This is not the first time Kanye would complain about not having a say in the lives of his children. He had in an interview complained of how security operatives harass him when he drops off his kids, as well as the idea of his daughter wearing makeup at a young age.
