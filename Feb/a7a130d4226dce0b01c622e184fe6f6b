Manchester United defender, Diogo Dalot, has snubbed his teammate and named Paris Saint-Germain’s Kylian Mbappe as his current favourite winger. When asked to name his favourite winger, Dalot didn’t mention any Man United player but named Mbappe. The 22-year-old disclosed this in an interview via Manchester United’s website on Saturday ahead of their away Premier League tie with Leeds United on Sunday. Dalot said, “So David, my favourite winger? He can be retired now? I always loved Ronaldinho so I would say Ronaldinho but let me think just because if it’s only from now. Now, I would say [Kylian] Mbappe.” Dalot joined Manchester United from Portugal giants Porto, in 2018. The Portugal international spent the 2020-2021 season on loan at AC Milan.
