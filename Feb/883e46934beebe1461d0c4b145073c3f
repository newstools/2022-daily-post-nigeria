The House of Representatives Committee on Constitutional Amendment has recommended immunity for presiding officers of the National Assembly. The committee, which presented its report on Wednesday, recommended among other things immunity from prosecution for Senate President, Speaker, Deputy Senate President and Deputy Speaker. In addition, the immunity clause will also cover judicial officers. It would be recalled that the committee had earlier stepped down the bill in January but the same committee is recommending the immunity law. If passed, the lawmakers will also enjoy the immunity that will prevent them from facing prosecution. It would be recalled that the Governor of Kano State, Umar Guanduje, despite a video of him stuffing cash in his ‘babariga’ has escaped prosecution thus far because of the immunity clause. Despite the outcry against the bill, lawmakers are moving closer to conferring such privilege on their presiding officers.
