The Coalition of United Political Parties, CUPP, has called for a total cancellation of the Ngor Okpala by-election in Imo State over alleged intimidation and harassment of the people. CUPP in a statement by its National Spokesperson, Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere called for a fresh election. He said, “The best thing for INEC is to cancel the entire Ngor Okpalla Election given the madness and attempt by Gov. Hope Uzodinma to rape the will of the people and visit his political 419 on our democratic process again. “Powers contained in the New Electoral Act must be tested and used to cleanse the attempt by Uzodinma to dirty our electoral process and rape the will of the people. “It’s painful that a few hours after Nigerians applauded Buhari for signing the Electoral Act, Uzodinma has embarrassed the President by visiting mayhem on the people and messing the law up. “The law must be used to tame Uzodinma by canceling the entire process to help rebuild confidence.”
