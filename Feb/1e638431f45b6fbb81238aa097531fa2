National Leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu has declared that he is ready to get dirty in the struggle to emerge next Nigerian President. The 2023 presidential aspirant on the platform of APC, stated this on Sunday during a consultation with the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi and the Olubadan-designate, Oba Lekan Balogun, seeking their various blessings. The Asiwaju vowed that no other contender would intimidate him out of the race, stressing that he is out to be President Muhammadu Buhari’s successor come 2023. His words: “No amount of intimidation can stop me. I am ready to get dirty. I am out to become President of Nigeria. We are at a crossroads.” Earlier, the former Lagos State Governor told the Alaafin that it was important for him to seek blessings from the traditional institution before embarking on the journey properly. He said: “I cannot embark on a project of such magnitude without seeking for prayers and cooperation of the traditional rulers. “I am here to inform our fathers of my decision to run for the position of the President of this country in 2023. What I need from our highly revered traditional rulers are their prayers and cooperation.”
