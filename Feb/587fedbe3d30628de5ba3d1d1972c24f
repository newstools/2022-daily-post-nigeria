Yobe State Governor and Chairman APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Mai Mala Buni, on Friday, received two Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, chieftains into the fold of ruling party. The defectors, Abdu Yakubu Dira from Daura B Ward and Alhaji Buba Kari Dumbulwa from Damagum B Ward all in Fune LGA, were received by the Deputy Governor, Idi Barde Gubana, on behalf of Governor Buni. He assured them that the APC would carry every member along. Buni also stressed that the entrants would be treated as full members of the ruling party without any discrimination while admonishing them to register and get their new party’s membership cards from their respective wards. He urged them to rally round policies and programmes of the present administration in the state. One of the defectors, Abdu Yakubu Dira, explained that they decided to dump PDP for the APC due to an unresolved issue. Dira added that the various developmental projects spread across the state by the Governor Mai Mala Buni led-administration, especially road construction linking Damagum-Dira to Gubana; provision of health care facilities; and youth empowerment, among others are worthy of emulation and commendation. He assured the governor that their teeming supporters will massively join the ruling APC soon.
