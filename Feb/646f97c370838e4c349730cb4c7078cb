Former Real Madrid striker, Ronaldo, has listed three things that will make Paris Saint-Germain’s Kylian Mbappe the world’s number one player. Ronaldo said that Mbappe’s strength, speed and finishing ability would soon lead him to become the finest player in the world. Mbappe’s current contract with PSG will expire at the end of the season. The France international is keen to join Real Madrid at the end of the season. “He is very strong. He has that speed and coolness in front of goal that will lead him to be number one,” Ronaldo said on Bobo Tv. He added, “And I have read the news that he will go to Real Madrid and earn 50 million [euros] a year. We were part of the wrong generation (laughs). “The football industry is growing so much that it’s only fair that the stars receive more and more money. If it’s like that today, it’s because there were players who inspired them, like we did.”
