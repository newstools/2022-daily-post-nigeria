The Yobe State Ministry of Environment has warned citizens of the state to desist from practicing open defecation and other attitudes that are harmful to human health. The Ministry via its Information Officer, Shettima Mustapha, handed down the warning in a statement, which highlights the quarterly sanitation activities across some major towns of the state. He equally cautioned the public on the dangers of depositing solid waste, which according to him, if not properly managed, can serve as breeding mosquito grounds and harbor other vermin, which can easily serve as vectors for the spread of diseases in the community. Mustapha noted that it is against this background that the Yobe State Government through the Ministry employed casual laborers to augment the quarterly refuse evacuation exercise carried out across the four major towns of the state which includes: Potiskum, Gashua, Nguru and Geidam towns. “This is to ensure adequate solid waste management before evacuation, as most of these solid wastes happen to be littered around and spread all over the communities by wind and scavenging activities”, the statement added. He said the casual laborers are working on a daily basis to make sure that all littered wastes are being raked and burnt to make it easier for evacuation in the quarterly evacuation exercise. “The Ministry is appealing to the general public to be conscious of any activity that will endanger life and well-being of the citizens, especially the activities of scavengers and those using the dumping sites for open defecation as those can tremendously trigger the spread of diseases in the community,” the statement advised.
