The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) carried out a major raid in Patey, Lagos Island, on Saturday. DAILY POST learnt that operatives of the agency recovered 5,862 kilograms of illicit drugs, including Loud and Codeine. A female kingpin, Mrs. Sherifat Kehinde Lawal, was arrested along with six others, Femi Babafemi, the spokesman announced. They are Ahmed Yisau, Solomon Alape, Olayemi Akinola, Salami Qudus, Bakare Rafiu, Rose Samson, Yusuf Rofiat and Chukwudi Egon. Babafemi disclosed that the operation followed intelligence and surveillance in Osho, Gambari and Beecroft streets. A team of anti-narcotic officers stormed Gambari street, the “base of the drug kingpin”. The agency said “the cartel in the axis” mobilized hoodlums who attacked the operatives with stones, bottles and guns to prevent arrest. “The operatives were able to tactically defend themselves, took the suspects and exhibits away”, it added. NDLEA Chairman, Buba Marwa commended the officers and men of the Lagos Command for their resilience. The retired General warned those being used by cartels to obstruct or attack anti-narcotic officers to desist or face dire consequences.
