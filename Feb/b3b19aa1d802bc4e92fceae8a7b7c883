A self-acclaimed disciple of Nnamdi Kanu, detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Simon Ekpa has claimed that he earlier predicted that DCP Abba Kyari would be disgraced for allegedly killing innocent Igbos. DAILY POST recalls that the former commander of the Inspector-General of Police Intelligence Response Team (IGP-IRT) who served in South-East but was suspended over alleged tie with an internet fraudster, Abbas Ramon, popularly known as Hushpuppi, was arrested by the Nigeria Police, on Monday. His arrest was sequel to fresh allegation against him on drug trafficking, as the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, declared him wanted for allegedly working with two international drug couriers, identified as Chibunna Patrick Umeibe and Emeka Alphonsus. He was subsequently arrested by the police and handed over to the NDLEA as more investigations continue. Reacting, Ekpa in a tweet on his official Twitter handle, on Monday, described the embattled cop as a criminal, who according to him, had killed innocent Biafrans. The tweet reads, “I called Abba Kyari a criminal even before the indictment in the US. I told him that for killing Biafrans, he will be disgraced and his career will end in Biafraland. “Today is he not known globally as a criminal? The big question is, what happened to all the innocent Biafrans he killed?”
