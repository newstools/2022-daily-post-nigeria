Ahead of the 2023 presidential election, Chairman of the Southern Governors’ Forum and Governor of Ondo State, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, on Tuesday, stated that any political party trying to pick its candidate from the northern part of the country will definitely fail at the polls Akeredolu emphasised that his colleagues, under the aegis of Southern Governors Forum are determined to ensure that the next president comes from the south. The governor stated this while receiving members of the Power Rotation Movement, who were led by Dr. Pogu Bitrus, who also doubles as the Chairman, Middle Belt Forum, in his office, Alagbaka, Akure. Akeredolu, who maintained that he believes in fair and equitable Nigeria, said those opposing the country’s power rotation are toying with the country’s continued survival. He praised the group for enlisting the help of young people in rallying support and votes ahead of the 2023 election. “We have come out and announced that power must go to the south in approximately two or three meetings. “Only a party willing to lose will pick a candidate from the north. You’ve evolved into a movement of political party members banding together. “Fair and equitable power rotation is what we stand for. The only thing that is fair is that it should come to the south after 8 years in the north. “Some people have argued that the presidency should be based on competence. Are they saying there are no competent ones in the south?” Earlier, the Chairman of the movement, Pogu Bitrus, said, “Leaders in the south and middle belt met in Abuja and agreed that power should rotate to the south, that the middle belt and the south should move against any party that fields any candidate outside the southern part of the country.”
