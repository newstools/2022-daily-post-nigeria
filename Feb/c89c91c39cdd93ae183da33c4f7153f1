Armed robbers, on Thursday, hijacked a bullion van in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, DAILY POST reports. The bullion van was attacked at Idi Ape junction, opposite a private school. Our correspondent gathered that the bullion van was attacked shortly after it left one of the banks in Ibadan, located a few metres away from the Testing Ground Police station, which houses one of the area commands of the Nigeria Police Force in the State. Sources at the scene claimed that two police officers escorting the bullion van were killed during the attack. The gunmen reportedly shot sporadically, scaring passersby while the operation lasted. Residents of Ibadan, on hearing of the attack, sent emergency messages to their loved ones to steer clear of the area. One of the messages reads, “Breaking…Please be careful. Bank Robbery at Idi Ape, BANK ROBBERY: KINDLY KEEP OFF IWO ROAD TESTING GROUND POLICE STATION AREA, IDI APÈ AREA WHERE SERIOUS ROBBERY IS HAPPENING NOW. BEWARE AND BE WISE. BEST REGARDS”. A video of the incident obtained by DAILY POST on Thursday showed that the armed robbers operated for several minutes. A resident of Ibadan, who asked not to be named, said some innocent people were also killed during the attack. “They killed the policemen and some innocent citizens. “The bullion van was attacked at the Idi-Ape junction, opposite Mary Hills. “Soldiers are now in the area,” the source said. But, all efforts made by DAILY POST to get a reaction from the Public Relations Officer of the State Police Command, Adewale Osifeso proved abortive. Several calls put through to his mobile phone were not answered. Also, an SMS sent to Osifeso asking for his reaction has not been replied to as of the time of filing this report. Video:
