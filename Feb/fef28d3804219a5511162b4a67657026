A former Rector of the Federal Polytechnic, Ede, Osun State, Builder Patrick Hussain has dragged his successor, Dr John Taiwo Adekolawole to court over alleged false and malicious accusation. Builder Hussain is alleging that the false and malicious accusation levelled against him by the Rector at a Governing Council meeting of the institution on August 5 and 6, 2019, was a calculated attempt to demean and assassinate his character and also damage his hard earned reputation. Crisis erupted between the two academics when Dr John Taiwo Adekolawole, the Rector of the Federal Polytechnic, Ede alleged that the former Rector, Builder Patrick Hussain supplied guns in the assassination attempt on three officers of the institution. The former Rector, in a Writ of Summon, number HED/05/2022 also claimed the sum of twenty six million and five hundred thousand Naira as special and general damage against Dr John Taiwo Adekolawole. He also averred that the current Rector had constantly subjected his person to ridicule and public odium. Reacting, the Rector, Adekolawole stated that he and Hussain have been friends for long and that there was no dispute between them. In his words, “I was his Pastor at Kaura Namoda. So, there is nothing a church member can do to his Pastor. A church member cannot take his pastor to court. The elder can correct the younger. I don’t wish him bad.” The Governing Council Chairman, Air Commodore Emmanuel Jekada (rtd.) however, said he was not aware of any suit.
