Governor Gboyega Oyetola has said the window of reconciliation is still open to those who are members of caucus groups within the All Progressives Congress (APC). He said this during his tour to Ayedire and Ola-Oluwa Local Government Areas. Oyetola urged the members of the APC to extend their hands of fellowship to aggrieved members who have shown genuine resolve to return to the party. He said “the window of reconciliation is still open to those who are members of the splinter group, to have a rethink and join the mainstream of the party structure. “This is where the party is and this is where God resides. It is our belief that with God, success is ours. I am resolute to continue to make you proud,” Oyetola said. He summoned the party loyalists to get ready for the February 19 governorship primary of the party, saying the time has come for the APC to be more united than ever before.
