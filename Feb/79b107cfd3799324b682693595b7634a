Rev. Fr. Joseph Shekari of St Monica’s Catholic Church, Ikulu Pari, who was abducted on Sunday has regained freedom. The Chancellor of the Catholic Diocese of Kafanchan, Rev. Fr. Emmanuel Okolo, in a statement on Tuesday confirmed the development. He said Shekari was released at about 10.30pm on Monday. Recall that the abductors demanded the sum of N60 million as a ransom for his release Okolo, however, thanked everyone who prayed for the priest’s release and directed that all priests of the Diocese celebrate Mass of thanksgiving to God for the quick release of Shekari. He prayed that God will repose the soul of Shekari’s cook who was killed during the attack.
