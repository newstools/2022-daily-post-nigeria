Manchester United defender, Luke Shaw, has identified the Red Devils to win the Champions League this season. Shaw said this ahead of Man United’s Premier League tie with Leeds United on Sunday. Man United will face Atletico Madrid in the Champions League round of 16 first-leg tie in Spain next week. The Old Trafford club has struggled for consistency throughout the campaign, even under the guidance of their interim manager, Ralf Rangnick. “This is the crunch time of the season and it’s very important in the league to get some momentum,” Shaw told the Mirror. “As a team, we believe we can win the Champions League. “Not many people on the outside will think it and some will think I am stupid for saying that. “But we have that belief and confidence that we can win it. “I am sure everyone in this dressing room – the players, staff and management – all have that belief that we can. “Now we need to pick some momentum up, get results and keep playing well.”
