Comedian, Mr Macaroni has joined many Nigerians to plead with the federal government to come to terms with the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, to end the nationwide strike. On Monday, ASUU President, Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke declared a nationwide strike following the Federal Government’s inability to implement demands that cut across funding and other welfare packages for lecturers. The ASUU National President had warned that the strike would be “comprehensive and total.” But Nigerian students took to social media to lament government’s alleged nonchalance towards education in public universities. Macaroni, while reacting to the development on his Twitter handle begged the federal government to meet the demands of ASUU. He said Nigerian students deserve better than strikes disrupting their academic year. His tweet read: “I plead with ASUU and the Nigerian Government to come to terms that will see to it that students return to school as soon as possible. Abeg! “Nigerian Students also deserve better.” Meanwhile, the National Association of Nigerian Students NANS had threatened to protest the decision of their teachers to embark on strike, stressing that students have been traumatized for too long. Asefon Sunday had in a statement condemned the manner the parties in dispute handled the negotiation, urging them to return to the negotiation table.
