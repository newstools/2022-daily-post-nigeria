Unknown gunmen on Monday attacked the convoy of Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, during a roadshow he conducted in Osogbo, the Osun State capital. It was gathered that the gun-wielding hoodlums, suspected to be political thugs, waylaid his convoy and started shooting in a bid to scare away the former governor of the state and members of his entourage. The pandemonium broke when Aregbesola got to Orisunbare market, close to Old-Garage when sounds of gunshots rented the air. There was pandemonium as his supporters ran for safety. A team of combined security operatives from the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Nigeria Immigration Service and Department of State Security, who were among Aregbesola’s convoy, repealed the thugs. This is coming after Aregbesola openly declared support for the former Secretary to the State Government, Moshood Adeoti and proclaimed him as the next governor of the state. Meanwhile, DAILY POST reported earlier that Osun State announced that it has credible reports that some “misguided cowards” have invaded Osogbo, the state capital with armed thugs to foment trouble.
