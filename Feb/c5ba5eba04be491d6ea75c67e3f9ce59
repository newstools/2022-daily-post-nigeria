Mr Cosmas Akighir, an APC chieftain has said the current Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs, Sen George Akume, has what it takes to be the next national chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC. Akighir stated this on Monday in a congratulatory message he issued to the newly elected Chairman of APC in Benue State, Mr Austin Agada. Recall that the ruling party has concluded plans to hold its National Convention on February 26 where it will elect a new chairman for the party. Akume is one of the contenders of the highly sort after APC Chairmanship positions. Akighir noted that Akume is a leader that would bring people together without favouritism and nepotism. He pointed out that he has paid his dues with the capacity to galvanise APC while also carrying the commoners along with the party’s mandate. “I believe if he hits the ground running, he is a leader that is close to the people, not a leader that waves from afar. “We need a leader that will listen to the yearnings of the common man because he knows where the shoe pinches. He is not an ordinary person, he started from the lowest cadre and rose up to Permanent Secretary in the State service, fulfilling his career in the civil service. He enjoined all APC members nationwide to support the minister adding that he is very passionate about taking the APC to the next sustainable level of progress.
