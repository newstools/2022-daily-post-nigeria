Former Governor of Kano State, Ibrahim Shekarau of the G-7 APC faction, has accused the national headquarters of the party of being unfair, unjust and irrational, for issuing Returning certificate to the Governor Ganduje factional APC Chairman, Abdullahi Abbas, few minutes after the Court of Appeal nullified their earlier Federal High Court’s victory. Shekarau described as unfair the act of the national headquarters of the party by issuing a certificate of return to the Governor Abdullahi Ganduje-led faction immediately after the Appeal Court judgement despite the faction having two court rulings for over two months without the party recognizing their court order. The Court of Appeal in Abuja on Thursday, dismissed the judgment of a lower court, which upheld the parallel congresses of APC conducted by the G-7 faction of the party led by Shekarau. Leader of the G7, Shekarau, while reacting to the Appeal Court’s ruling in Kano, lamented that despite his faction always expressing readiness for true reconciliation and respect to the party national hierarchy, they were unjustly treated by issuing the Ganduje-led factional Chairman, Abdullahi Abbas certificate recognising him as authentic leader of the party executives in the state. ‘’For over two months, we have two High Court rulings recognising the congresses conducted by our faction, but the national headquarters of the party did not in its wisdom accord us the recognition to have issued our elected Chairman, Ahmadu Haruna Zago certificate, but just few hours after the Appeal Court ruling of Thursday, the party issued Abdullahi Abbas certificate of return,’’ Shekarau decried the situation an audio obtained by DAILY POST.
