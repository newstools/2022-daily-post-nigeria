The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has accused the All Progressives Congress, APC, of plotting to elongate President Muhammadu Buhari’s tenure. PDP’s National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, said Buhari’s delay in signing the Electoral Act Amendment Bill was a plot by the APC to elongate Buhari’s tenure. In a statement, Ologunagba warned of the dangers of not signing the bill into law. According to Ologunagba, Buhari and the APC administration are “heightening apprehension across the country and orchestrating a constitutional impasse that can railroad our democracy into an emergency tenure elongation. “Widespread restiveness with consequential violence, bloodletting and attendant humanitarian crisis in the country that may affect the entire West Africa subregion, Europe, America and other parts of the world if not addressed.” Yesterday, the Presidency had said Buhari would sign the Electoral Act Amendment Bill within hours. Buhari’s spokesman, Femi Adesina, said the President would sign the reworked bill into law. The National Assembly had on January 31, 2022, transmitted the bill to the executive for signing, after it was amended. The bill is expected to be signed by the President within 30 days of its passage.
