Barcelona boss, Xavi Hernandez, has warned his players, including the club’s new signing, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, that they are in for ‘test of fire’ against Atletico Madrid. Xavi warned Barcelona players that Atletico Madrid is a very difficult team that dominates the high pressure and low block. Barcelona will, on Sunday evening, host Atletico Madrid in a LaLiga tie at Camp Nou as they continue to battle for a top-four spot. Xavi’s men are currently one point and one place behind Atletico Madrid, who occupy the final top-four spot on the LaLiga table. A win against Diego Simeone’s side would be huge in the Blaugrana’s bid to grab a top-four finish this season. Speaking at his pre-match press conference ahead of the clash, Xavi said, “We will play against a very difficult team that dominates the high pressure and the low block. “We will have to show that we have trained well. It will be a test of fire.”
