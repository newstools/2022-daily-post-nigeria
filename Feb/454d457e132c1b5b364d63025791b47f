Food items, including yam, grains, among others, worth over N200 million, have been destroyed by fire outbreak, which occurred in the early hours of Saturday, in Wukari Local Government Council of Taraba State. DAILY POST reports that the incident, which cause could not be ascertained as of the time of filing this report, occurred when the traders had all retired home. Visibly dejected, the chairman of the Yam Market, Anthony Agbu, confirmed that the incident which started at about 12a.m. on Saturday, led to massive destruction of their goods. Stressing how the inferno will tell negatively on the people, as well as the farmers, he said the need for the relevant authorities, to as a matter of urgency, provide succor to the affected traders, had become necessary. “As you have seen, our yam market and all our goods have been razed down by the fire incident that occurred here early this morning,” he said. Some victims, including Justina Theophilus, Emmanuel Gani, Chindo Magaji and Margaret Adashu, who spoke with DAILY POST, said all their resources have been destroyed. Also devastated by the incident, the Council Chairman of Wukari, Dr. Daniel Adigrace, said, “when I was called last night that this market was on fire, I quickly mobilized my team and rushed to the scene.” Lamenting the level of damages, he called on both the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), as well as the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) to wade in.
