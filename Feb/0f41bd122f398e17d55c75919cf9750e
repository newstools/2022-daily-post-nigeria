Nigeria legend, Austin Jay-Jay Okocha has reacted to the appointment of former Barcelona winger, Emmanuel Amuneke as Super Eagles assistant coach. Okocha described Amuneke’s appointment as a ‘positive’ development for the Super Eagles, adding that the former Tanzania head coach is going to add value to the national team. Recall that the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) had a few days ago announced Amuneke’s appointment into Super Eagles technical crew ahead of Nigeria’s 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifier against the Black Stars of Ghana in March. Amuneke was named the Chief Coach and Augustine Eguavoen’s first assistant, while Salisu Yusuf was named Second Assistant Chief Coach of the Super Eagles. Joseph Yobo is the Third Assistant, while Aloysius Agu is the Goalkeepers’ Trainer. “Amuneke’s coming to Eagles coaching crew is a good addition. We all know how qualified he is and the value he’s bringing to the team,” Okocha was quoted by This Day as saying. “He was successful in Tanzania and his inclusion is a positive one for Nigeria. It shows our intentions in getting things right ahead of the playoffs.”
