Nollywood actor, Alex Ekubo, has decried the situation of things in Nigeria as fuel scarcity hits the nation. According to him, the negative uncertainty in Nigeria is alarming as things can change in minutes. Alex Ekubo on his Twitter page wrote: “The negative uncertainty in Nigeria is alarming, you just go out and on your way back. Boom! Fuel scarcity.” DAILY POST observed that long queues resurfaced recently at filling stations in Abuja and Lagos. Nigerians have taken to social media lamenting about the increase in transport fares and long queues at petrol stations. Some petroleum marketers in Lagos speaking with NAN on the condition of anonymity, blamed the current scarcity on the supply of a wrong specification of petrol in some parts of the country. They noted that the directive to withdraw the product from the market even after distribution to many filling stations across Lagos and other areas created a supply shortfall, thereby, leading to panic buying. The marketers noted that the fuel scarcity will persist in the state and other parts of the country until depots are restocked with adequate and quality products.
