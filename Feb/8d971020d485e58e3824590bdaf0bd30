Cameroon coach, António Conceição has given reasons his team was not able to beat Egypt in the second semi-final of the Africa Cup of Nations on Thursday. Egypt beat the host 3-1 in a penalty shoot out sending the Indomitable Lions into the third-place clash with Burkina Faso on Saturday. The Pharaohs have a date with Senegal in the final on Sunday. Both Cameroon and Egypt failed to find the net in the entirety of the 120 minutes with the North Africans coming out on top through a penalty shoot-out. “We are sad, but this is football,” Conceição told a press conference after the game. “The game was close, but the players were exhausted in the second half. “At the first half, however, we played well and we were close to scoring on more than one occasion. “We practiced for penalty kicks, but in the end, everybody could miss. The players are only human after all.”
