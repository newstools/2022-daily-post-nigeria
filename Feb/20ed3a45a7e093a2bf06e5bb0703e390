The Plateau State Government has called on members of the Police Community Relations Committee (PCRC) in the state to remain united in their task of ensuring security in their various communities. The call was made by the Commissioner for Environment, Mr Usman Idi, during an emergency congress meeting in Jos, the state capital. Idi, who is the chairman of the PCRC in the state, said, “This meeting has shown that members of PCRC are united and the structures are also intact and ready to contribute their quota in curbing insecurity.” According to him, “This meeting is an avenue to assess the PCRC’s situation as a family and look at the possible grey areas and ways in which such areas can be addressed.” He commended the members for contributing their quota to the Nigeria Police Force in terms of information gathering in order to stem crime in the state. He urged the members to continue bridging the socio-psychological gap between the police and the public. Also speaking, the Assistant Secretary, PCRC Area Command, Mr John Maren, commended the leadership of the chairman. He said that since his assumption of duty as the chairman, the PCRC in the state had witnessed unity and progress.
