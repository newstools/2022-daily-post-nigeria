Former House of Representatives members of the All Progressive Congress extraction have described the lack of internal democracy in the APC as a great threat to the successes of the party. The forum enjoined delegates to the upcoming national convention to only elect reputable, credible and trusted party chieftains as members of the National Working Committee (NWC) to move the party to success in the 2023 general elections. Ibrahim Zailani, the forum’s Protem Chairman, in a communique at the end of a meeting in Abuja, advised the top echelon of the ruling party to abide by all tenets of democracy in the interest of the nation. Zailani said, “It is in the progressive interest of the party to ensure that internal democracy reigns supreme.” The meeting reviewed the current state of the APC and called on the Caretaker/ Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee to ensure that internal democracy is sustained in the party.
