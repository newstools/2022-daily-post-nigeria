A 36-year-old mother of four, Mrs Opeyemi Omoyemi, has been jailed by a Magistrate Court sitting in Akure, the Ondo State capital for brutalizing and inflicting body injuries on her 12-year-old house help identified as Joel Sunday. Omoyemi was sentenced to four and half years imprisonment following her arraignment on a five-count charge. On count one, the defendant was sentenced to three and a half years in prison with hard labour, while on count five, she was sentenced to one year in jail. The defendant was accused of inflicting various injuries on the body of the house help with a stick and razorblade after accusing him of stealing meat from her pot of soup. Omoyemi was accused of committing the crime in her home at the Idimango Adewale axis, Ondo road in Akure, the state capital, on February 6, 2022. During the trial, the Prosecution Counsel, ASP Emmanuel Tanimowo, requested that count four be dismissed, which the Magistrate, Mrs O.A Edwin, approved. Folusho Kayode, the Defense Counsel, urged the court to be lenient in sentencing the prisoner, citing the fact that he was a first-time offender. He also told the court that Omoyemi, a mother of four little children, was the one in charge of the victim’s well-being. Following the sentencing, the Magistrate also adjourned the case to April 13, 2022, for trial in count three of the charge bordering on trafficking in persons to which the defendant had pleaded not guilty.
