Barely a month after the non-academic staff of the Taraba State University suspended their strike action, the academic staff of the institution is set to bring to a halt learning activities in the school. The staff who staged a peaceful protest on Thursday said nothing would stop them from downing their work tools if the school management and the state government continue to deny them their rights. The protesting staff staged the protest shortly after their Congress, demanding improved welfare for academic staff. Their threat to embark on the strike came barely one week after Governor, Darius Dickson Ishaku, showered encomiums on the union during the combined convocation of over eight thousand students. The rating of the institution among the best in the country by the National University Commission ( NUC), it would be recalled, Ishaku said was made possible by the lecturers whom he admitted are hardworking. The lecturers through the University ASUU’s chairman, Dr Samuel Shiikaa, said they are fed up with the incessant signing of memoranda of understanding with the state government, which according to him never sees the lights of the day. They alleged that the Governor never matches his word with action by improving the welfare of University teachers. According to him “Since 2009, we have been signing memoranda of understanding with the state government, but the government will always not honour its own side. The union threatened that academic activities would soon be brought to a standstill if urgent actions are not taken by the state government. Payment of pensions and timely promotion of its members are some of the many demands of ASUU in Taraba State.
