Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma has cautioned Nigerians against forcing and blackmailing President Muhammadu Buhari into signing the Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law. Uzodinma said Buhari had the constitutional backing to study the bill and address areas he is not comfortable with. Speaking with journalists in Owerri, Imo State, the Governor urged Nigerians to allow the President to do his job. “I don’t understand the anxiety and the propaganda of trying to force the President or blackmail the President into signing the Electoral Act without following the constitutional dictates by ensuring that he studies the Electoral Act. “He has the mandate of all of us; over 200 million Nigerians to study the act and if there are things in his opinion that he considers not to be in the best interest of the people, he has to address it. “All these social clubs and anxiety here and there, it is not the best thing. I think we should allow the President to do his job,” he said. Buhari is yet to sign the Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law after the Senate transmitted it to him. Buhari’s spokesman, Femi Adesina, had said the President would sign the bill either Tuesday or Wednesday, but he failed to do so. However, reports emerged yesterday that Buhari will sign the bill on Friday. Amid the delay, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, had accused the All Progressives Congress, APC, of attempting to extend Buhari’s tenure. The PDP alleged that tenure elongation was the reason for Buhari’s delay in signing the bill into law.
