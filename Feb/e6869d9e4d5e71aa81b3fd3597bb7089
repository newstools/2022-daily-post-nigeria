The Chairman of Ussa Local Government Area of Taraba State, Rimamsikwe Hassan Karma, has imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew on the council.

The people Rufu and Lissam communities, where said to have on Friday engaged themselves in a battle that led to massive destruction of property. Speaking to DAILY POST via telephone, the chairman admitted that the people took the law into their hands by going as far as attacking themselves and destroying valuables. Karma noted that problem started when masquerades from one of the communities allegedly went berserk, flogging innocent people. DAILY POST gathered that the masquerades even beat up a pastor, a situation, which angered the other community, who immediately went on a reprisal attack.
