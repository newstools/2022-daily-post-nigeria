The leadership of the Taraba State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has called on its supporters to take advantage of the ongoing Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Continuous Voters Registration (CVR) exercise. The call came on Friday through the party’s chairman, Agbu Kefas, during the party’s executive caucus meeting, which took place at its state secretariat located in Jalingo, the state capital. The meeting, which DAILY POST learnt, was geared towards strengthening the party ahead of the 2023 general elections, was observed to have brought together all the party’s executives from across the state. Optimistic that the party will emerge victorious in the next polls, the need for eligible voters in the state to turnout en masse and embrace the ongoing exercise, the chairman said has become necessary. While appealing to those above 18 years who have not yet registered to endeavor to take advantage of the exercise, those that want their voting points or unit and area changed, he said, should as well not hesitate to grab the ongoing opportunity. In this same vein, the immediate past chairman of the party, Victor Bala Kona, also urged the party executives spread across the state to mobilize supporters at the grassroots to participate in the exercise. On his part, the northeast zonal chairman of the party, Emmanuel Bovoa, stated that the commission’s schedule of appointments for online and physical CVR, at the INEC offices in both states and local governments nationwide had commenced long ago. He called on eligible people in the state to, as a matter of urgency, take advantage of the exercise by finding out time to get themselves registered. He also urged them to endeavor to complete the process at designated centers from where they can obtain their Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC) in order to avoid being disenfranchised.
