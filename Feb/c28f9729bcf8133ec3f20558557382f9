Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, has given injury updates ahead of Friday’s FA Cup clash against Middlesbrough. Rangnick hinted that Paul Pogba could start a game for the first time since November after recovering from a thigh injury. However, Edinson Cavani, Victor Lindelof and Eric Bailly are unavailable. Jesse Lingard, who failed to seal a move away from Old Trafford this January, will also not feature. “Paul will be part of the group and might even be in the starting XI. “Edinson Cavani contacted me at the weekend and asked to have two more days at home. I knew he couldn’t be in the starting XI with jet lag anyway. “Lindelof has been ill the whole week and not training. The same is true with Jesse, who asked that we could give him a couple of days off to clear his mind. “Eric Bailly came back yesterday, he has some problems with his ankle and will not be part of the squad. “Luke [Shaw] will be playing because Alex Telles played 90 minutes for Brazil,” Rangnick said.
