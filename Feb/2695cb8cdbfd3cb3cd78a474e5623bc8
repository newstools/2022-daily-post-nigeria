Super Eagles defender, Zaidu Sanusi is set for a shock move to Premier League club, Newcastle United. The Spanish transfer market website, Fichajes indicated that Sanusi has emerged as Newcastle United’s primary summer transfer target for the left-back. Newcastle is looking at bringing in a left-back as Matt Targett, who joined the Magpies on loan last month could return to his parent club Aston Villa with no option or obligation to buy included in the deal bringing him to St James’ Park. Sanusi, who currently plays his club football at FC Porto, has drawn the interest of Newcastle as the Premier League team is keen to bolster the squad next season. Sanusi’s current contract with Porto will expire in 2025. The 24-year-old is back in the plans of Porto manager, Sérgio Conceição, after falling out of favour at the start of the season. He featured in all Porto’s matches played during the group stage of this season’s Champions League.
