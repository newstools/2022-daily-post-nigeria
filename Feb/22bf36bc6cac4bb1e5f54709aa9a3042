Leicester City forward, Kelechi Iheanacho, has admitted that he was gutted over Nigeria’s elimination from the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). The 2021 AFCON will come to a conclusion on Sunday, with Egypt taking on Senegal in the final. Nigeria was eliminated from the AFCON in the round of 16 after losing 1-0 against Tunisia. But Iheanacho, who was the match-winner for Nigeria against Egypt, however, said he was happy to be back at Leicester City and has shifted his focus to Sunday’s FA Cup fourth-round clash with Nottingham Forest. “I’m happy to be back,” Iheanacho told LCFC TV. “Obviously, I’m gutted that [Nigeria] are out of [AFCON], but now I need to focus on the club duties. I’m happy to be back and into games straight away. “It’ll be a big one, a rivalry, so hopefully we’ll give the fans a good game and we’ll win the game.”
