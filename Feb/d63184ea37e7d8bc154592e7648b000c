President Muhammadu Buhari’s Personal Assistant on New Media, Bashir Ahmad, has congratulated Senegal on winning the 2021 African Cup of Nations, AFCON, in Cameroon. Ahmad described the Senegalese victory against the host nation, Cameroon, as well deserved. In a series of tweets, the Presidential aide faulted the decision to award Senegalese player, Sadio Mane, the best player of the tournament. He wondered how Mane was able to defeat Cameroon’s Aboubakar to the award. Ahmad tweeted: “Congratulations to Senegal on winning the #AFCON2021. Well deserved. “Sadio Mané awarded the best player of the tournament, how? Cameroon’s Aboubakar is by far the best player of this #AFCON2021. They should have given him his award.” The Teranga Lions defeated their Egyptian rival 4-2 on penalties to lift the 2021 AFCON on Sunday night. The 2021 AFCON final was played at the Paul Biya Stadium, Olembé, in Cameroon. The match ended in a 0-0 draw as both Senegal and Egypt failed to score after 120 minutes.
