Borno State Governor, Babagana Zulum, has put the figure of terrorists who have so far voluntarily surrendered themselves to military authorities at 30,000. He said with the way they were massively laying down their weapons, insurgency in the state may come to an end under his tenure “God willing.” He gave the figures shortly after he met with President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House on Thursday to apprise him of progress in the surrendering of Boko Haram terrorists. “Over 30,000 former fighters have now surrendered and are in the custody of the authorities,” he revealed. He debunked claims of any incentives, saying the Borno State government does not offer any incentive to the fighters to come out of the forests, rather, they have done so voluntarily. The Governor who had earlier warned that ISWAP was gaining ground in the North East, told State House Correspondents that he discussed the continuing surrender of the insurgents and the case of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) with the President. He gave a ray of hope, insisting that the security situation in Borno State has improved tremendously, praying that the situation continues in that direction. Zulum who had also suggested that the federal government consider hiring mercenaries to battle the terrorists noted that kinetic measures alone will not end the war easily.
