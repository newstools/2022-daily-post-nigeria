The Osun State Government has charged the Commissioner of Police in charge of the State to fish out the perpetrators of the attack on the Oranmiyan House campaign office of Rauf Aregbesola, the immediate past governor of the State and current Minister of Interior. This is as the State government publicly condemned the Thursday’s attack on the political edifice which has always served as the meeting place for members of The Osun Progressives (TOP), a faction of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) who are loyalists of the former governor. The condemnation was contained in a statement signed by Funke Egbemode, the State’s Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation in Osogbo, on Thursday. Egbemode, who dissociated the State government from the dastardly attack, added that attributing such mischief to the government was wicked since it had invested heavily in the peace that the State was currently enjoying. The Commissioner also called on parents and guardians to be more vigilant with their children in order to forestall their being used as instruments in the hands of mischief makers, even as elections were around the corner. She added that governments had directed that anyone caught in the act of criminality or disturbing the peace of the State under any guise will not be spared by the law. On Thursday evening, armed men who had come in a Sienna bus stormed the political edifice shooting sporadically. Eyewitnesses, who spoke to DAILY POST, revealed that they also attacked the building which is situated along the Gbongan-Ibadan road with the intention of setting it ablaze. According to the eyewitness, “the armed men shot at the transformer, set ablaze the transformer and wanted to torch the building, but they failed in their plan.”
