The Leader Of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, on Thursday, identified some politicians who can’t succeed in their aspirations to become governors in their respective states in 2023. In a statement signed by his media aide, Osho Oluwatosin, Primate Ayodele said some aspirants in Delta, Ebonyi, and Cross River states can’t become governors in 2023. He cautioned them against spending money on election campaigns because “God has not anointed them to lead the states.” Primate Ayodele identified the politicians as Arthur Jarvis, Daniel Asuquo, Prince Godswill Edward, Asuquo Ekpeyong, and Festus Keyamo. He also named Great Ogboru, Senator Emmanuel Aguariavwodo, and the deputy governor of Delta State, Kingsley Otuaro. Furthermore, the clergyman said Fidelis Nwankwo, Mr Chris Uzulor, and Edward Nkwoagu can’t become governors in their respective states in 2023. Primate Ayodele’s prophetic revelation cut across the All Progressives Congress (APC), and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the states named. The statement reads: “For PDP in Cross River, the man of God mentioned Arthur Jarvis and Daniel Asuquo while Prince Godswill Edward, Asuquo Ekpeyong were mentioned in the APC. “In Delta state APC, Primate Ayodele warned Minister Festus Keyamo, Great Ogboru and mentioned Senator Emmanuel Aguariavwodo, the deputy governor of the state, Kingsley Otuaro in PDP. “In Ebonyi state, PDP’s Engr Fidelis Nwankwo, Mr Chris Uzulor, and APC’s Edward Nkwoagu as politicians who won’t become governor in the state in 2023.” Ayodele urged those he identified to spend their money on philanthropic work, rather than waste it on political campaigns. He stressed that there is a blessing in carrying out philanthropic work than spending so much on a campaign that won’t yield anything.
