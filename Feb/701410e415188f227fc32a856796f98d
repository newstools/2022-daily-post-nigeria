The Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) has told the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to upload the results of polling units timely on its result viewing (IREV) portal. The Director of CDD, Idayat Hassan, made the call in a statement on Saturday. Hassan said the timely upload of election results on the electoral umpire’s portal would enhance transparency, credibility and confidence in the process. She also called on the security agencies to demonstrate neutrality by creating the enabling environment for a fair contest by all contestants in the race. She added that the organisation has deployed observers to the six area councils to monitor the election and ensure improved quality. The parties that are fielding candidates in the chairmanship and councillorship elections across six local government areas include Action Democratic Party (ADP), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Social Democratic Party (SDP), All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) and All Progressives Congress (APC). Others are the Allied Peoples Movement (APM), African Action Congress (AAC) and Labour Party (LP).
