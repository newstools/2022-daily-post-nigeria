Emmanuel Offiong Bassey, Chairman of Akpabuyo Local Government Area, Cross River State, has alleged that the opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), is plotting to disrupt the February 26, 2022, bye-election for the vacant Akpabuyo State Constituency seat in the House of Assembly. Over the weekend, he told state officers as well as southern leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC), led by former Senator Florence Ita-Giwa who called on him preparatory to the bye-election, that the PDP have a plan up their sleeves to cause problems and disrupt the election. Earlier, he had laid the same complaint before traditional chieftains of the local government whom he invited to his office. “We have credible information that PDP leaders are planning to cause problems during the by-election. “We have on good authority that they will bring in mercenaries on the day of the by-election”, he said. He urged the village heads and clan chiefs to be vigilant during the period of electioneering especially the bye-election coming up barely two weeks from now. He also urged them to report any strange faces in their various villagers to the authorities. Bassey had also asked the village heads to go to their various domains and call out their subjects who don’t have voters cards to take advantage of the current voter’s registration in the country. “Your voter’s card is your power. It guarantees the future of your children when you use it to elect leaders of your choice who will give you good governance,” he said. The monarchs pledged cooperation and appealed that their monthly stipend of N7,500 is increased.
