The Rasaq Salinsile faction of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State has condemned the announcement earlier made by the State government that some misguided cowards had invaded Osogbo with armed thugs with intent to foment trouble. In a statement signed by Abiodun Agboola, the Publicity Secretary of the faction, it revealed that the intention of the shootout in Osogbo was to take out the Interior Minister, Rauf Aregbesola, by attacking his convoy at Orisunmibare Market, on Monday evening. The statement revealed that for about twenty minutes, the Old Garage part of Osogbo was thrown into panic as traders and road users ran helter-skelter as a result of gunshots from the security operatives and political thugs. The faction noted that when the convoy was attacked, a team of combined security operatives from the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps, Nigeria Immigration Service and Department of State Services, who were among Aregbesola’s convoy, stepped down from the vehicles and started shooting in a bid to scare away the armed thugs. It maintained that in a bid for the government of Adegboyega Oyetola to tarnish the good name of the minister, it quickly put up a report, deceiving many that the minister invaded Osogbo. It called on the government to produce evidence of dead bodies which it claimed to have died as a result of the shooting, stating that no person was wounded in any of the minister’s outings. While qualifying the action of the Osun State Government as irresponsible and a ploy to scare away people, it noted that Osun which was adjudged the third most safest State in Nigeria before Oyetola became Governor, is now one where political violence and insecurity thrived. DAILY POST had earlier reported that the State government had announced that it has credible reports that some misguided cowards have invaded Osogbo, the State capital with armed thugs to foment trouble.
