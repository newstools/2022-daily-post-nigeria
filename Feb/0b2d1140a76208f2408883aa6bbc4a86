Former Manchester United striker, Michael Owen has predicted the outcome of today’s Champions League round of 16 fixtures. Paris Saint-Germain will host Real Madrid at Parc des Princes in the Champions League round of 16 first-leg tie. Manchester City will clash with Sporting Lisbon in an away Champions League round of 16 first-leg tie at the Estádio José Alvalade. Providing his predictions, Owen told BetVictor: “This should be a thriller. With all the attacking talent that’s on show, we will see goals. PSG probably haven’t been at their best this season, but they’ve got so much quality. I fancy them here. “I’m predicting a 2-1 PSG win, and it wouldn’t surprise me if Messi scored yet again against Real! Commenting on the Sporting Lisbon vs Manchester City game, Owen said, “Away trips in the Champions League are never easy, but this should be straightforward for City. Sporting are a decent side, but this is as good a draw as they could have got. “I’m sure Sporting will keep it tight early on, but City will have too much quality for them. 2-0 City.” The kick-off time for all the games is 9 pm.
