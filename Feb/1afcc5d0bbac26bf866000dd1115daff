Funmilayo Adebayo, a controversial Nigerian evangelist popularly known as Mummy GO, has warned Nigerians against celebrating Valentine’s Day. Mummy GO described Valentine’s Day celebration as a day the kingdom of darkness has dedicated to convincing people to celebrate immorality, adding that the day is not worth celebrating. According to her, Valentine’s Day was initiated by the kingdom of darkness to destroy people. The evangelist said this in a viral video. DAILY POST reports that Valentine’s Day is normally celebrated by lovers all over the world on February 14. Mummy GO said: “The story that happened that they said they are celebrating as Valentine does not deserve celebration. The story has nothing to celebrate, but the enemy just chose it because that man, Valentino, or what did they call him, they knew everybody loved him because he’s a good person who helped people and showed love to everyone. “Yet, how did he die? He died a useless, terrible death. He died of dejection if you know the story very well. Is that something that needs to be celebrated? No. “But they purposively chose it because the kingdom of darkness needs a day dedicated for falling, destruction and how do you convince people to celebrate immorality: they use popular figures loved by others.”
