Tottenham Hotspur manager, Antonio Conte, has become the latest football figure to call for peace and speak out against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia had on Thursday invaded Ukraine following weeks of rising political tensions in the region. The conflict escalated on Friday, with the fighting reaching the capital city of Kyiv. Sports people, teams and organizations around the world have joined in the condemnation of Russia’s attack. Recall that dozens of civilians have been killed and hundreds wounded after Russian rocket artillery opened fire on Ukraine’s second-largest city Kharkiv, authorities in Kiev said on Monday. The world of football has stood up against Russia today after Premier League clubs acted during their top-flight matches over the weekend. “My opinion is that it’s a very sad situation. We are in 2022 and to talk about the possibility of being at war is incredible,” Conte said during his pre-match press conference ahead of Tottenham’s fifth-round FA Cup clash against Middlesbrough on Tuesday night. “It’s incredible and at the same time it’s stupid. Only to think about this. “We need to have peace in the world, not people dying for this type of situation. I repeat, it is incredible in 2022 to have a war. “War is not the answer for anything. The world has to be compact and show solidarity against stupid people.”
