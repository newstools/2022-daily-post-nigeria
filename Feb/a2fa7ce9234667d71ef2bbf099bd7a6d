Leicester City manager, Brendan Rodgers has claimed that Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel is not happy because the Blues are not currently top of the Premier League table. Chelsea have seen their Premier League title hope falter over recent months after a run of just three wins in their last ten league games. Tuchel’s side now sit 13 points behind current leaders Manchester City, with it now looking improbable that they will end their five-year wait for a Premier League title. As a result, Rodgers has suggested that Tuchel will not be satisfied with his side’s current position, with only Man City manager, Pep Guardiola, the only one who can claim to be happy with the table. Speaking after Leicester City’s Premier League 2-0 defeat to Liverpool on Thursday, Rodgers said at his post-match press conference: “I think every team other than Man City won’t be happy. That is the reality of it. “If you ask every manager, are you happy, I think Man City would probably say, Pep [Guardiola] would probably say, yeah, I’m quite happy. “Jurgen [Klopp] won’t because he’ll want to be top. Thomas [Tuchel] won’t because he will want to be top.”
