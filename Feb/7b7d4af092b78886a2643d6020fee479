Former Arsenal star, Kevin Campbell, has told Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp not to start forward Diogo Jota when his side clashes with Chelsea in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday. Jota picked up an ankle injury in Liverpool’s 2-0 win over Inter Milan in the Champions League last week. The Portugal international has since missed two matches for Liverpool and he is currently pushing for fitness ahead of their Carabao Cup final against Chelsea this weekend at Wembley Stadium. “I just hope Liverpool don’t take a risk on him [Diogo Jota],” Campbell told Football Insider. “They don’t need to. Put him on the bench if need be but don’t start him. They have got other players who can do the business.” He added: “Jota has been instrumental in getting Liverpool there, but it is not worth risking him for the long term. Make sure he is OK and if he is, get him on in the second half. Do not risk him and rush him back for the League Cup final. It’s a trophy but let’s be honest, it’s more important that Jota is fit for the Premier League and Champions League.”
