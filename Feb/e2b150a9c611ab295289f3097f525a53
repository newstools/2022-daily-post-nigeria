The Leader Of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, on Thursday said God has already destined his choice of Nigeria’s next president in 2023. Primate Ayodele revealed that the majority of those running already will “fail because God has destined his choice to be the next president of the country in 2023.” In a statement by his media aide, Oluwatoyin Osho, the clergyman warned against zoning of the Presidency in 2023. He warned that zoning would not help the country’s situation, stressing that God would totally decide the presidency. Primate Ayodele warned that the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, would lose if they opt for the zoning of their presidential ticket. According to Ayodele: “Zoning will not help the situation in the country now, God may decide to pick anyone from north, east, west, south. Nobody will determine who becomes president in 2023 except God. “Majority of those running up and down will fail, the 2023 presidency is destiny and divine, no one can stop whoever God has chosen. God will give Nigerians an ordained president in 2023. “PDP must not do zoning, it will make them lose gallantly, they should get a credible candidate that Nigerians can go for, if they go by the law of zoning, the party will fail.”
