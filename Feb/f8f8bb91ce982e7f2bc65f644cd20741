Justice Emmanuel also granted bail to Prophet Adeniran in the sum of five million naira, with two sureties in like sum who must be members of the church. The trial judge, while maintaining that the conditions must be met within five working days, added that Prophet Adeniran will be remanded in Ife Correctional Centre if he failed to meet the conditions.

He allegedly gathered some young girls at his Church in Ido-Osun and was sexually abusing them.
