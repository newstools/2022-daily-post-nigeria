Shehu Sani, a former federal legislator, has warned President Muhammadu Buhari against retiring to Daura, Katsina State after his tenure. The former lawmaker is worried by the spate of insecurity in the State, which has led to the killing of over 1,192 persons and abduction of over three thousand others, according to reports. President Buhari has on several occasions announced his desire to return to his farm in Daura when his eight years in office ends in the next 16 months. However, the spate of insecurity in the North West has remained unabated, with kidnapping for ransom and killings happening more than ever before. “That bandits killed 1,192 and kidnapped over three thousand in Kaduna last year alone, outpaced the number of people killed and abducted in Yemen and Libya,” the former lawmaker, who represented Kaduna central senatorial district in the ninth National Assembly, tweeted. “If this is the State the President wants to retire and settle, he must secure it first,” he cautioned. Just yesterday, a report emerged from the State of suspected bandits killing a village head, Alhaji Jafaru Rabi’u, and abducting a yet-to-be-identified lady at Daddara Liman, Jibia Local Government Area of Katsina State on Wednesday night. Mallam Yunusa, a resident in the area, said the terrorists also killed four other people at the nearby Daddara village, located within the same Council. According to the report, the bandits looted several household materials as the villagers ran for safety.
