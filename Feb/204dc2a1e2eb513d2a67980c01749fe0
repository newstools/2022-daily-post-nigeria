The Jigawa State Government has directed security forces to deal ruthlessly with the activities of the National Taskforce of Importer’s Association of Nigeria (NATFORCE) operating in the state. This was contained in a statement by the Director of Special Services, Yusif Muqaddas, issued to DAILY POST in Dutse, the state capital. “I am directed to write and convey government directives for the clampdown of illegal activities of National Taskforce of Importers Association of Nigeria which is operating an illegal paramilitary outfit in the state. “This is coming despite the clampdown order on its operation by the Office of the National Security Adviser. “The task force, which was purposely set up to combat illegal importation of small arms and light weapons, has been involved in fraudulent offers for jobs to youths using letterheaded papers marked with the logo of Nigeria’s Coat of Arms.” He, therefore, called on youths in the state to be on alert on the activities of the illegal outfit and report any of its conduct to the security agencies. Muhaddas, therefore, called on ministries, departments and agencies to shun patronage of the illegal security outfit.
