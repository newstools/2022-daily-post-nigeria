Valuables worth millions of naira were destroyed in a fire incident that razed a building of eight bedrooms in Ilorin, Kwara State on Friday. The fire razed part of the building located at Aleniboro street off Ajase-Ipo road in Ilorin at about 5.30pm. A statement in Ilorin on Saturday by the spokesman of the Kwara State fire service, Hassan Adekunle, disclosed that one Mr. Lazerm alerted the brigade to the scene at about 17:30hrs. He said the timely intervention of firemen saved the whole building from being consumed. Out of the eight bedrooms in the building, only three were affected. “Based on our intelligence report from the scene, the conflagration was caused by the careless attitude of one unknown person who set refuse on fire which later spread to the affected building,” the spokesman added. The Director of State Fire Service, Prince Falade John Olumuyiwa, urged the general public to be safety-conscious at all times.
