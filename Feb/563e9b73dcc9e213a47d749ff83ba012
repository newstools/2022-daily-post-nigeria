Anthony Joshua has admitted he will be supporting arch enemy Dillian Whyte, when he takes on Tyson Fury in a WBC world heavyweight title fight. Fury will defend his title against Whyte at Wembley on April 23. The highly-anticipated all-British showdown has finally been agreed following weeks of speculation and negotiations. Joshua, speaking before Lawrence Okolie’s cruiserweight victory over Michal Cieslak at the O2 Arena on Sunday, told IFL TV: “Dillian Whyte needs to come in, look at what Tyson Fury does and reacts to, and do the complete opposite. Maybe work the body, and be conditioned to go the distance. “But I hope Dillian trains hard [and] doesn’t underestimate Tyson. Because it’s his first shot for Dillian, I think he’ll be hungry, do you know what I mean? “I’m rooting for Dillian, even though I hate him, and I want to smash him one of these days. “Go on Dillian, I’m with you all the way.”
