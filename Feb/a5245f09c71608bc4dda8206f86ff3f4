Former Super Eagles goalkeeper, Peterside Idah, has insisted that Egypt captain, Mohamed Salah, could not perform against Senegal in Sunday’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, final because the Lions of Teranga players kicked him left, right and centre. Idah said that the Senegalese defenders ensured they tamed Salah by kicking him from every angle during the AFCON final. Salah was quiet during the encounter as Senegal defeated Egypt to win their first AFCON. Sadio Mane led Senegal to defeat Egypt 4-2 in a penalty shootout in the 2021 AFCON final in Cameroon. “This is Africa; it is different here, this is a jungle, they kicked him left, right and centre. In Europe, the referees will protect you (but) here nobody protects you,” Idah told Channels Television’s ‘Sunrise Daily’ programme. “When you are in Europe, they are very structured…but when you come to Africa, it is different, we don’t play to the rules, so he [Salah] just could not perform.” “I expected Senegal to win. Senegal has been a better team. I would have felt so bad if Egypt had won it because we (Eagles) had beaten Egypt in the first game. So, I was praying for Egypt not to win it. Senegal was the better side.”
