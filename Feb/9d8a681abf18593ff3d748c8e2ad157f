Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has said he did not enjoy his last days at Paris Saint Germain. However, Tuchel insists he doesn’t look back at his time in France with bitterness. The German was infamously sacked on Christmas Eve in 2020 by PSG before joining Chelsea in January 2021. Tuchel has also said he is happy to be at Stamford Bridge working in the Premier League. “What makes me happy at Chelsea? I am happy, very happy. I found a very competitive club in a very competitive league, with a lot of very high-level coaches. And it’s a pleasure to be part of it. “If these are things that I missed at PSG? I didn’t say that. It was different, but I liked the experience, I liked my players a lot and being in this city. “Playing at the Parc des Princes was always exceptional. It was a totally positive experience for me. Maybe not the end, given the context, but the two and a half years in Paris were exceptional,” Tuchel told Canal Champions Club.
