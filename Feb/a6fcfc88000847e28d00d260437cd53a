Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State has ordered full enforcement of road traffic laws in the state to curb the menace of road accidents. This followed a recent fatal road crash, which claimed 16 lives in the state. The governor gave the directive on Thursday when he received the news of a road accident involving two vehicles, which claimed many lives along Damagum-Damaturu highway. In a statement signed by his spokesman, Governor Buni decried the increasing number of accidents on highways in the state and, therefore, charged motorists to be more careful on the road. He said, “It is sad and most unfortunate losing people to road accidents. “We must enforce the laws to curb these avoidable accidents,” he added. Governor Buni condoled with the families of victims of the accident and prayed Allah to grant them eternal rest and to the families the fortitude to bear the loss.
