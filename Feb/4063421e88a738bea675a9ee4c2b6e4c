The University of Lagos (UNILAG) has allayed fears over an incident on the campus. A viral video circulating on social media and WhatsApp suggested there was a kidnap attempt. On Wednesday, the footage caused apprehension among students, their families and friends. A press release by UNILAG Communication Unit stated that the narrative was a rumour and falsehood. The management said the incident was a case of social misconduct and physical assault between students. “One party attempted to flee the scene and was apprehended by the security towards the Onike gate axis of the University. “The case is being handled by the Security Unit and Division of Students Affairs,” the statement read. The foremost institution assured that the security and safety of all students remained a priority. Police spokesman in Lagos, Adekunle Ajisebutu, also confirmed there was no kidnap or an attempt. “It was a case of misunderstanding between a female student and three others (one of whom is a UNILAG student). “It led to an assault on the lady and some of the security guards,” the Public Relations Officer added.
