The Federal Government has lambasted the Canadian Government and Twitter for allegedly playing double standards by supporting the 2020 EndSARS protest while clamping down on ongoing trucker’s protests in the country. Some individuals in Canada had moved to shut down the country following the COVID-19 vaccine mandates and other pandemic restrictions in the country. In a bid to force the protesters to back down following the havoc being wreaked by the aggrieved citizens, the government declared the demonstrators, terrorists and insurrectionists. It was gathered that Twitter, a global social medium, suspended the account of individuals sponsoring the protest after over US$10m was raised. Jim Watson, the Mayor of Ottawa, the capital city of Canada has also declared a state of emergency in the city in response to the unfortunate development, saying the protests posed a threat to residents’ safety. Reacting, the Minister of Information and Culture, Mr Lai Mohammed lamented that Twitter and Canada which allegedly supported the EndSARS protest leading to the destruction of lives and government properties in 2020 are now clamping down on similar protests in Canada. The Minister who said the Federal Government was not gloating over the unfortunate happenings in Canada, claimed it is only “calling attention to the double standards involved in the way protesters deemed to be violent are perceived in Nigeria and the West. “Those who referred to the hoodlums who destroyed public and private property in Nigeria under the guise of EndSars as peaceful protesters have tagged similar protesters in their own countries as insurrectionists and terrorists. This glaring double standard should not be lost on all Nigerians.
