Ivory Coast legend, Didier Drogba, has become the latest football figure to praise former Nigeria captain, Austine ‘Jay Jay’ Okocha’. Drogba, who won the Champions League with Chelsea in 2021, took to his Instagram stories to praise Okocha with the caption “My Number 10”. He posted himself and Okocha with the caption ahead of the African legends match against former Senegal players. The game is to celebrate the inauguration of the 50,000 capacity Abdoulaye Wade Stadium in Senegal. Drogba and Okocha joined other African football legends like Emmanuel Eboue, Samuel Eto’o, Patrick Mboma, Asamoah Gyan, Emmanuel Adebayor and others to play against a Senegalese team full of former internationals. Recall that former Cameroon striker, Samuel Eto’o, also said Okocha would’ve been put on the same pedestal as Ronaldinho if he was not African.
