The Ministry of Finance building in Abuja’s Central Area went up in flames Wednesday morning. The exact section where the fire started is not known yet. Officers from the Fire Service are at the scene. The incident occurred barely two weeks after a similar one at the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN). The inferno reportedly started from office of the Special Adviser to FMBN MD, Ahmed Dangiwa, and spread to the boardroom. There have been multiple fire outbreaks at federal agencies in Abuja in the last three years. In October 2019, fire gutted the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) headquarters. In April 17, 2020, parts of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) office was burnt. Similar incident happened one week earlier at the office of Nigeria’s Accountant General. Earlier, fire broke out at the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) headquarters. Nigerians continually express worry about the federal government’s refusal to initiate a thorough probe of the incidents.
