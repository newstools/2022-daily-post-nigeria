Barcelona forward, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, has revealed that he urged teammate, Ousmane Dembele to stay at the club once he knew he was heading to Camp Nou in the January transfer window. Aubameyang and Dembele were teammates during their time at Borussia Dortmund where they flourished together. Recall that Dembele almost left Barcelona during the January transfer window. Aubameyang joined Barcelona on the last day of the January transfer window after the Gunners terminated his contract. “It is something very special because we had an incredible year in Dortmund and he is an incredible player,” Aubameyang told Mundo Deportivo. “Ousmane is one of the best with the ball and, for a striker, he is incredible. “To tell the truth, I am very happy that he is here and when I arrived, I told him: ‘You have to stay, man,'” he revealed. On whether Dembele would be staying, Aubameyang said: “I don’t know, but the only thing I can say is that everything is possible in life.”
