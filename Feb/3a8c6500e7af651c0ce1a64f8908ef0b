Operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) came under attack on Saturday in Lagos State in the course of effecting the arrest of a suspected drug kingpin. NDLEA’s spokesman Mr Femi Babafemi confirmed the attack in a statement. “NDLEA has arrested a drug kingpin and seized drugs in a notorious drug den on Lagos Island. “The drug kingpin mobilized members of his cartel to attack men of the NDLEA. “The operatives were on the Island to arrest the kingpin of the illicit trade before they were resisted and massively attacked,’’ Babafemi said. DAILY POST reports that this is coming less than two days after the NDLEA apprehended singers, Zinoleesky and Mohbad after a midnight raid on their residence in Lagos. Babafemi had explained that cannabis and molly were recovered by the operatives in the singers’ residence.
