Lagos State House of Assembly Speaker, Mudashiru Obasa, has mourned Professor Tunde Samuel, a former adviser to ex-Governor Bola Tinubu. He described the late member of the Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC), led by Tinubu, as a titan whose positive roles cannot be forgotten. Samuel, a founding member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), died on Wednesday night at the age of 73. At a visit to the family on Thursday, Obasa said his exit would take a long time for Agege people, the APC, the GAC and Lagos to bear. “His importance can never be under-emphasised. He was a passionate Lagosian whose thoughts, actions and activities were all geared towards strengthening democracy in Nigeria. “As an academic, he helped Lagos to establish a firm foundation for educational growth and progress with his imprint in Lagos State.” Obasa further hailed the deceased as a star with brightness that cannot be dimmed, The lawmaker prayed God to grant him rest and give the family, friends and associates the fortitude to hold up. Samuel was one of Tinubu’s policy and political strategists, a close friendship that dates back decades.
