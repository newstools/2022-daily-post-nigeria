Mr. Terver Akase, former Chief Press Secretary to Governor Samuel Ortom has condemned the conduct of security personnel attached to the gate of the Air Force Base Makurdi who denied the governor to receive the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo. DAILY POST had reported that the governor, who was at the Air Force Base on Saturday to receive the Vice President, who was on his way to Taraba State, was bounced by security personnel at the gate. Reacting, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, governorship aspirant in Benue State, Akase described the action of the security personnel as unfortunate and unwarranted in a democratic setting. In a statement issued by the Media Director of his Campaign Organization, Nathaniel Nongu, Akase opined that Governor Ortom’s move to receive the Vice President was not unexpected since the VP was passing through the state. Mr. Akase stated that if the presidency did not set out to embarrass the governor, why did it have to write and inform him about the Vice President’s visit? He enjoined other Nigerians, particularly those aspiring for the office of governor across party lines, to condemn the action of the Makurdi Air Base security personnel who were responsible for the incident, stressing that it can happen to anyone else tomorrow. The 2023 governorship hopeful urged public servants assigned national duties to always be professional and relate with Nigerians irrespective of political affiliation.
