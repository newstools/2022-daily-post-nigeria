Manchester United will not stop Cristiano Ronaldo from leaving this summer if he demands a transfer away, the Sunday Mirror reports. The 37-year-old will quit the Reds again at the end of this season if they fail to qualify for the Champions League. And it is understood the club will allow him go if it is clear he wants to leave. There is now a growing acceptance inside Old Trafford that bringing Ronaldo back after 11 years spent with Real Madrid and Juventus was an error of judgement. The move was driven by both commercial factors and the determination to stop him joining rivals Manchester City. But despite topping United’s scoring charts with 15 goals, Ronaldo is showing signs of wear and tear after playing almost 19 seasons at the top level.
