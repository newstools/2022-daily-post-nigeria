The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, has declared a suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, wanted. NDLEA’s spokesman, Femi Babafemi, declared Kyari wanted for alleged links with an international drug cartel. Babafemi disclosed this during a press conference held at its headquarters on Monday. Kyari was suspended over his alleged involvement with an international fraudster, Ramon Abass, popularly known as Hushpuppi. The former Intelligence Response Team, IRT, boss was alleged to have benefitted from a heist carried out by Hushpuppi and his gang in Dubai. He, however, denied involvement in Hushpuppi’s fraudulent activities. Babafemi disclosed that NDLEA has evidence linking Kyari to a drug cartel that operates the Brazil-Ethiopia-Nigeria illicit drug pipeline. He said the former DCP needs to answer questions that came up in an ongoing drug case in which he is the principal actor. Babafemi explained that Kyari’s refusal to cooperate with the Agency led to him being declared wanted. The Agency’s spokesman noted that security agents who should be partners in the pursuit of President Muhammadu Buhari’s mandate are at the forefront of breaking the law. According to Babafemi: “Today, we are forced to declare one of such law enforcement agents wanted in the person of suspended DCP Abba Kyari, the erstwhile Commander of Intelligence Response Team (IRT) at the Force Intelligence Bureau of the Nigerian Police Force. “With the intelligence at our disposal, the Agency believes strongly that DCP Kyari is a member of a drug cartel that operates the Brazil-Ethiopia-Nigeria illicit drug pipeline, and he needs to answer questions that cropped up in an ongoing drug case in which he is the principal actor. “Today, we are forced to declare one of such law enforcement agents wanted in the person of suspended DCP Abba Kyari, the erstwhile Commander of Intelligence Response Team (IRT) at the Force Intelligence Bureau of the Nigerian Police Force.”
