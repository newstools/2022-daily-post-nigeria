The immediate past spokesman of the apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Mazi Chuks Ibegbu, has admonished presidential hopeful and national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, not to threaten anybody with playing dirty because of his ambition to become Nigeria’s President in the 2023 general elections. Ibegbu said this in a statement forwarded to DAILY POST on Wednesday, on the heels of the clamour by the Igbo nation to take her turn on Nigeria’s highest seat of power in Abuja. He noted that it is treasonable of Tinubu to threaten Nigerians and he should learn to play politics without bitterness. He queried why the APC national leader should descend so low just to get power, lamenting that Tinubu has turned himself into a political monster. According to him, “I think, this is not the Tinubu we used to know. Something is wrong somewhere. We are begging his close allies to talk to him. “It is the turn of the southeast of the Igbo nation, God’s spirit, our Nigerian gods and even African and world deities are aware of that”.
