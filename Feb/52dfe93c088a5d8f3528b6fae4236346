Manchester United legend, Paul Scholes has criticized forward, Marcus Rashford following his display in the Red Devils’ Champion League 1-1 draw against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday night in Spain. Scholes said Rashford is too anxious and always searching for a ‘magical’ moment in a bid to rediscover his form after the England international endured another passive performance against Atletico Madrid. Rashford was unable to make an impact at the Wanda Metropolitano and he was withdrawn for Anthony Elanga in the 75th minute by Man United interim boss, Ralf Rangnick. Elanga eventually scored a late goal to ensure Man United drew with Atletico Madrid in the Champions League round of 16 first-leg. “He looks too anxious for me, he looks like he is trying almost too hard,” Scholes said on BT Sport. “Every time the ball comes to him it almost feels like he is trying to do something magical. It is probably the worst thing you can do. “I always remember when going through a tough time, the manager [Sir Alex Ferguson] said to keep it simple. Just work your way back into the game. He doesn’t seem to be able to do that. He is always thinking he has got to produce something. “He has just got to calm himself down, work himself into the game and the form will come back,” he said.
