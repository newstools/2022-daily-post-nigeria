The new Niger State Commandant of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Mr. Aliyu Garba Bature, has warned criminals and vandals of critical national assets to steer clear of the state. Bature, who stated this in Minna, said those that refused to adhere to the warning should be ready to face the full wrath of the law.
According to him, the corps under his leadership will make the state unbearable to vandals and their sponsors to stay. The Commandant also stated that NSCDC in the state will not relent in its determination to protect and ensure the safety of critical national installations across the state. Addressing officers and men of the command, Bature warned that he will not condone any act of professional misconduct, adding that he has zero-tolerance for corruption. “We are warning vandals and criminals to turn a new leaf or the command will go after them. Also, there is a need for men and officers of the command to live up to their responsibility in the discharge of their duty.” He further expressed his readiness to work round the clock to make the state inhabitable for vandals and other criminal minded elements in the state. “We also request people of the state and traditional rulers, community leaders in the state to continue to monitor the activities of strange faces in their midst and provide information to the command for prompt action assuring that such information will be treated with absolute confidentiality.”
