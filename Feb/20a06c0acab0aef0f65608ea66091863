Al Hilal star, Odion Ighalo, has given his verdict on Watford forward, Emmanuel Dennis. Ighalo expressed confidence that Watford, who are currently in the 19th position on the Premier League table, will escape relegation this season. “He [Emmanuel Dennis] is a very good player, with good technique, he is fast, he can score goals, he is very intelligent,” Ighalo told Watford TV. “He just needs to keep fit and keep taking his chances and scoring goals. “I think if the season is going to turn around, and they’re going to be safe, then they’ll have to keep Emmanuel Dennis, [Ismaila] Sarr, and [Joshua] King firing. “Get a couple of goals home and away; then I think the team [Watford] can escape relegation.”
