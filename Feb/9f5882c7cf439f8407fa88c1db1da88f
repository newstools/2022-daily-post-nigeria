Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand, has said that his former club are lacking mobility. He also warned the Red Devils against signing Wolves’ Ruben Neves and Leicester City’s Youri Tielemans, adding that the midfielders would not provide solutions to the mentioned problem. Paul Pogba could be on his way out of the club on a free transfer this summer, while manager, Ralf Rangnick is understood to be keen on reinforcing the squad’s midfield options at the end of the season. Portuguese midfielder, Neves was linked with a move to Old Trafford during the winter window but Wolves were reluctant to sell unless for a £40 million fee. Tielemans’ contract at Leicester is running out with the Belgian unwilling to renew and the Foxes would be willing to sell him for a £35m fee. Asked about Neves, Ferdinand told his show Vibe with Five: “I like him, he’s fantastic, he keeps the ball as well as anyone, a really good footballer.” On the prospect of United signing Tielemans and Neves to partner Fernandes in the midfield, Ferdinand replied: “That wouldn’t be my choice, I’ve got to be honest. “I like them, good players, but if you think that midfield is getting you any closer to the other teams I’d argue against it. “Mobility-wise we’d be lacking.”
