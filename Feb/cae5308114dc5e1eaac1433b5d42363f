The Yobe State Governor and Chairman APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Hon. Mai Mala Buni has said the problems in the party are very surmountable and do not constitute any threat. The Governor stated this in a statement by his Spokesman, Mamman Mohammed when he received members of the Buhari Campaign Organisation who paid him a courtesy visit. Buni said the party was bound to have some friction among its membership because of its huge size. “A party as large as the APC with over 41 million membership is bound to have some differing opinions among stakeholders, but it is very surmountable. “We are on top of the situation and we are optimistic of approaching the National Convention and the 2023 general election with a united front,” he said. Buni assured that the party would partner the Buhari Campaign Organization in all its activities. “The BCO is a very strong organisation with a wide reach; the party will work closely with you during the convention and the general election”, he assured. Earlier, the Grand Patron of the Organization, Sen. Abba Aji Katsina said the organization was making contributions to promote unity in the party. “We are here to assure you of our total support to a successful convention and the 2023 general election”, he said.
