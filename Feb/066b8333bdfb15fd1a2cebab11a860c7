The Secretary to Government of Katsina State (SSG), Dr. Mustapha Muhammad Inuwa, has called on the Federal Government to deploy more troops, sophisticated equipment to end the act of terrorism bedeviling the state and the entire northwest. The call was contained in a statement made available to DAILY POST by the Director of Press to the SGS, Abdullahi Aliyu Yar’adua, after the newly-posted Katsina Commissioner of Police paid him a courtesy call in his office on Tuesday. The SSG pledged that the Masari-led administration would not relent in its efforts to see peace returned to the entire state before the tenure elapses. In the same vein, Mustapha assured that the state government will continue to provide the necessary logistics and support needed to the security agents to ensure they succeed in the fight against terrorism and other heinous crimes across the state. He commended the efforts of the security agents in tackling the lingering challenges bedeviling the state, charging them to put more effort as many rural areas are still under severe threat from the hoodlums. Mustapha also reiterated the need for security agents to embark on coordinated and simultaneous attacks on the terrorists’ hideouts rather than wait for them to attack innocent communities before taking action on the hoodlums. The new Katsina State Police Commissioner in his remark earlier, said he was in the SGS office to solicit for the government’s continued support and cooperation in the discharge of police duties in the state. CP Dabban, while pledging to do his best, expressed readiness for synergy with other security agencies in tackling the menace of the hoodlums, said he has been adequately briefed by his predecessor and he is well aware of the level of insecurity in the state.
