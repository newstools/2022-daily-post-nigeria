Former Manchester United and Watford striker, Odion Ighalo has named former Arsenal playmaker, Mesut Ozil, as the best player he played against in his glittering career so far. Ighalo said this when he appeared as a guest on Thursday evening’s edition of Inside The Hive to answer questions from Watford supporters. The 32-year-old faced Ozil four times during his time with Watford and managed to win only one of the matches against the former Germany international. The Al-Hilal star made 100 appearances in all competitions for Watford, scoring 39 goals. The Super Eagles attacker spent roughly three years at Vicarage Road. Asked to name the best player he has played against, Ighalo said, “I have come up against many players. “I will say when we played against Arsenal, I came up against Mesut Ozil. He is a very good player and very skillful.” Ozil currently plays for Fenerbahce in the Turkish first-division league.
