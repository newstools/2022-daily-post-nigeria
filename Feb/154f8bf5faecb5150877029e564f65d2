Shehu Sani, a former Kaduna Central Senator has reacted to reports that Beninese government has extended Yoruba Nation freedom fighter, Sunday Igboho’s detention by six month. Sani described Igboho’s detention as inhuman and condemnable. In a tweet, the activist, however, distanced himself from Igboho’s separatist activities. “I don’t support Igboho’s separatist ideas and activities in anyway, but the reported extension of his detention by six months is inhuman and condemnable,” Sani tweeted. Reports has it that Yomi Aliyyu, Igboho’s counsel revealed that the freedom fighter’s detention was extended by six months without any criminal charges brought against him. Igboho was arrested on July 19, 2021, in Cotonou, while on his way to Germany. This was after he fled Nigeria to Cotonou in Benin Republic. The Department of State Services, DSS, had declared the Yoruba Nation agitator wanted after weapons were allegedly discovered in his Ibadan residence.
