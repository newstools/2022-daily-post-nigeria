Senator Ajibola Basiru, spokesman of the Nigerian Senate, has said no faction exists in the Osun State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Basiru, who represents Osun Central Senatorial District in the National Assembly, also said that there is no pending suit challenging the leadership of Gboyega Famodun as the state chairman of the party. He made this known Wednesday while answering questions bothering on the party and its leadership on Politics Today, a current affairs programme on Channels TV. While maintaining that the election that brought in Famodun as chairman was never challenged by any person, he added that any individual posing as chairman of a factional APC in the state is a comedian. In his words, “The election that brought up Prince Gboyega Famodun as Chairman of Osun APC was never and has never been challenged by any person, adding that if anybody else is purporting as chairman of factional APC, such person is a comedian. “No appeal, protest or litigation have been instituted to challenge the authentic leadership of Prince Gboyega Famodun in Osun APC.” Basiru, who pointed out that there was a court action instituted to challenge the ward congress, disclosed that it was struck out on grounds of lacking jurisdiction, lack of cause of action and representation by the Federal High Court in Osogbo. The former Osun Attorney General also said that another case instituted at the State High Court, Ikire was struck out for lack of diligent prosecution
