The Niger State Government has solicited the support of the Nigeria Immigration Service to help monitor and check the influx of illegal immigrants into the state. The Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Ahmed Ibrahim Matane made the plea during a visit by the new Comptroller of the NIS, Niger State Command, Nongo Samuel Shima to his office. Tasking the service to fish out illegal and criminal immigrants, he explained, “their nefarious activities have become inimical to the state. We must put a stop to the perpetration of criminal activities.” The SSG expressed the readiness of the state to partner with the service in tackling the incessant security challenges in some parts of the state. He further stated, “we reassure the new Comptroller of Immigration that government will continue to support the Immigration service in the state with a view to succeed in carrying out its mandate.” Shima had earlier told Matane in his address that he was in his office to familiarize himself with the government and people of the state. “We want to reaffirm the readiness of the Service to partner with the state government in finding lasting solutions to the security challenges bedevilling some parts of the state,” he said. He thanked the SSG for the warm reception given him since his arrival to the state while commiserating with the government and people of the state over the demise of the former SSG, late Hon. Ibrahim Isa Ladan, who died on Saturday in Abuja after a protracted illness.
