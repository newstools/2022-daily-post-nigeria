Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has said that his team will catch Liverpool in the Premier League table if they improve their game, style and win games. Tuchel said this during his post-match press conference after Chelsea defeated Crystal Palace 1-0 in a Premier League tie on Saturday. Recall that Hakim Ziyech’s late second-half goal ensured Chelsea defeated Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. Chelsea are in the third position on the Premier League table with 7 points behind second-placed Liverpool after 25 games. “They [Liverpool] look very strong. It’s what it is. They have a huge player in the winter to make their squad stronger and it’s how it is,” Tuchel said. “I will not give in and tell you today that it’s not possible to catch them. We will, but there is no other way than to improve our game, improve our style, and to win game after game after game. “There is no need to look at Liverpool, Man City or behind. We have enough to deal with and enough to improve. From there we start.”
