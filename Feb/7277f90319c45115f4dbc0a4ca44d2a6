As part of its CSR drive and strengthening security in the oil producing region, Green Energy International Ltd (GEIL), operator of the Otakikpo Marginal Field, has donated a mini barracks to the Nigeria Navy. While receiving the donation, the outgoing Flag Officer Commanding (FOC), Eastern Naval Command, Rear Admiral S.K Ibrahim, represented by Commodore SG Olubode Fazaz, the Commander, Nigerian Navy Ship Jubilee, applauded Green Energy International Limited (GEIL) for the consistent focus on securing the area of operation in Andoni, stating that the mini barracks will provide more accommodation and facilities to the naval staff in performance of their duties. He added that the Nigeria Navy will continue to provide adequate security to critical national assets (CNA) in the Niger Delta to ensure increased economic development of the area, for the overall benefit of the people and investors. While calling on other companies in the area to emulate GEIL, the FOC added that “This project would not only contribute positively to the operational effectiveness of the Naval Outpost Ikuru town, but will also boost the morale of personnel of the Outpost.” Ibrahim said he felt a great sense of fulfilment knowing that another positive impact has been made to the Nigerian Navy. In his remarks, the Chairman, Green Energy International Ltd (GEIL) Prof Anthony Adegbulugbe said the building of the mini barracks was part of the company’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) to aid the performance of the Nigeria Navy. “The project was a follow up to the building of the Navy facility and barracks in Ikuru town in Andoni community in 2015, and donation of Hilux trucks in 2019.”
