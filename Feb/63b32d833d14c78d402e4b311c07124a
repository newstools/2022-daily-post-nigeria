Former Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar has disclosed how he and late Alex Ekwueme “invented” zoning into the party’s affairs. Atiku disclosed that he invented zoning during a discussion with Ekwueme, and they went ahead to implement it. The former Vice President disclosed this during his interaction with the Let’s Fix Nigeria with Atiku group in his Abuja residence. Addressing the group, Atiku recalled how he “bought the idea of zoning in the PDP during a discussion with a former Vice President, the late Dr. Alex Ekwueme.” He assured that he would adopt measures that would unify and stabilize Nigeria if elected. “But then, as a multi-ethnic and multi-religious country, we felt that there should be a sense of belonging. We went and invented this zoning. “Therefore, we went further to say there should be zonal representation. So, let me assure you that as far as I am concerned, I will observe and implement whatever will bring about the peace and stability of this country,” he added. Atiku is yet to declare his intention to run for the presidency in 2023. The Waziri of Adamawa had said he was still considering his plan to run for the presidency in 2023.
