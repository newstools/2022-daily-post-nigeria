Ekiti State House of Assembly has passed a resolution calling on the State government to deploy traffic control officers across all the roads in the state. The resolution was a fallout of observations by Femi Akindele, representing Irepodun/Ifelodun constituency 1 while speaking Under Matters of Public Importance at the House plenary in Ado Ekiti. Akindele said the move will check the incessant road accidents currently being witnessed due to over-speeding on the improved road network in the state, particularly on the new Ado-Iyin road. He observed that the deployment of traffic officials would ensure sanity on the road. In his reaction, the Speaker of the House, Funminiyi Afuye noted that the improved road network across the state had led to reckless driving by motorists and advised that a resolution be passed to check the trend. The resolution was subsequently approved by the lawmakers. Meanwhile, the Ekiti State Pension Reform Bill, 2022 has successfully passed through the second reading at the House plenary with the bill committed to the Committee on Public Service, Establishment and Training for further legislative scrutiny. Introducing the bill, the leader of government business, Gboyega Aribisogan described it as timely and desirable, especially since pension issues in Nigeria had become a burning within the ranks of civil servants. He urged his colleagues to support the bill to ensure its speedy passage. Lawmakers including Aribasoye Adeoye, Akin Oso, Ajibade Adeyemi, Yemisi Ayokunle, Olubunmi Adelugba and Adegoke Olajide aligned with the Leader of Business on a quick passage of the bill due to its expected benefits. The bill was subsequently committed to the Committee on Public Service, Establishment and Training for further action following the suggestion of the Speaker to allow the inputs of stakeholders.
