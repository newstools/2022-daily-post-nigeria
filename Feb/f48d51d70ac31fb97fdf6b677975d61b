Former Manchester City striker, Sergio Aguero, has named the five strongest defenders that he faced during his career. Aguero has been reflecting upon his playing days, having been forced into early retirement this season due to health reasons. It came after the 33-year-old suffered a heart scare while playing for Barcelona in October. During his career, he also featured for Atletico Madrid. Aguero was holding a questions and answers session on Twitter, when he replied to a question asking who his five toughest defensive opponents were in his career. He named three Premier League stars – John Terry, Rio Ferdinand and Virgil van Dijk – alongside two LaLiga legends: Carles Puyol and Sergio Ramos. Aguero faced Puyol and Ramos during his stint at Atleti prior to his switch to the Premier League. His choices are perhaps unsurprising, with former Chelsea captain Terry, Liverpool defensive colossus van Dijk and Manchester United legend Ferdinand all renowned as being among the best in the position.
