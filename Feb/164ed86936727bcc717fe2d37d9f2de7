Former Real Madrid head coach, Zinedine Zidane, has reportedly rejected the opportunity to take over from Mauricio Pochettino at Paris Saint-Germain. Amid recurrent links with the Manchester United job, Pochettino has been tipped to leave PSG in 2022 and the French Ligue 1 giants were supposedly keen to part ways with the Argentine last month. According to TF1, via GFFN, Zidane was identified as the leading candidate to replace Pochettino, but the Frenchman turned down the chance to return to the dugout in Paris. The report added that Zidane is disgruntled with the way that PSG is run, as well as their style of play, leaving a lot to be desired. The former midfield maestro also didn’t want to come up against Real Madrid in the UEFA Champions League later this month. PSG are still thought to be planning for life after Pochettino, though, with a separate report claiming that the 49-year-old could be relieved of his duties by March. Zidane has been heavily linked with a move to become coach of PSG, France national team and Manchester United in the past. Following the glorious spell at Madrid, Zidane decided to take a sabbatical but returned to the Los Blancos when they landed themselves in trouble again. His second spell at Santiago Bernabeu did not see him win another UEFA Champions League, but he did lead Madrid to their 34th LaLiga title in the 2019-20 season. Zidane has been reluctant to take up a new project since leaving his Real Madrid job at the end of the 2020-21 season. I can leave Real Madrid for good of everyone – Zidane
