Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams has alerted of schemes aimed at bringing down the Oodua People’s Congress (OPC). Adams declared that the socio-cultural organization remained the most persecuted in Nigeria since its inception in 1994. At the 2022 Thanksgiving Service in Lagos, he noted that the OPC had weathered the storm and challenges from its fold and outside. The high chief accused “powerful establishments” in the South-West of trying hard to “destroy” the group. Adams, however, thanked God for the journey of nearly three decades, recalling that a number of OPC members lost their lives. On Nigeria, he said the country possessed the potentials, both human and material resources, to be one of the most powerful in the world. “The leaders drifted through continued neglect of tradition. OPC has distinguished itself as the only socio-cultural organization that celebrates God with different events.” Adams listed Eledumare festival, Oodua festival and others designed to promote the cultural identity of Yoruba race. Speaking, Osi Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Chief Gani Balogun reiterated the need to foster unity and peace. “I am sure history will be kind to the OPC as an organization that stood by the Yoruba race, fought and still fighting to ensure that the Yoruba stand above others”, Balogun said.
