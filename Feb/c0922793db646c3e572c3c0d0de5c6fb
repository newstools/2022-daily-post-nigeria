Chelsea defender, Emerson Palmieri, has given a reason why he rejected an early return to the club during the January transfer window. Palmieri is currently on loan at French Ligue 1 side Lyon from Chelsea. Chelsea sought to cancel Palmieri’s season-long loan deal with Lyon in January after losing Ben Chilwell to injury but failed to recall the Italy international. While Lyon refused to sanction the move, Palmieri was reluctant to push for a return to Chelsea as the January transfer window eventually closed. But Palmieri is now saying that he refused to return to Chelsea in January because he made a promise to Lyon sporting director, Juninho, that he would stay at the club until the end of his loan deal. “I didn’t go back to Chelsea because I promised [Lyon sporting director] Juninho that I would stay for a season,” Palmieri told Lyon’s official website. “I am a man of my word. I like being in Lyon, I want to be here. “For next season, it’s difficult to say because it depends on the clubs, but I am happy here.”
