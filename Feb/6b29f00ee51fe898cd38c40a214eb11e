President Muhammadu Buhari says the Federal Government will continue to support initiatives that would create wealth, jobs and opportunities for young Nigerians. He urged them to acquire knowledge and skills to innovate, create, be productive and contribute value so as to build their future and make Nigeria better. Buhari made the call at the weekend during the combined convocation ceremony of the Federal University, Wukari in Taraba State. The Nigerian leader’s (Visitor’s) address was delivered by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. He encouraged youths to see challenges “as opportunities for the creation of solutions, as we are a nation with a rapidly expanding population with attendant human sustenance needs.” “You belong to one of the most resilient, dynamic and energetic populations on this planet – a people that are by nature undaunted by the challenges of their environment”, his speech read. The President noted that the Nigerian can-do spirit was an inspiration to establish globally renowned industries and achieve great things. “Nigeria is now home to the third-largest film industry in the world. We are the epicentre of a global and pan-African popular culture driven by the dynamism of Nigerian creatives.” He hailed youths’ impact on technology, adding that tech entrepreneurs and innovators are not just applying their talents to profit-making endeavours, but also addressing social problems. Buhari charged the demography to maintain the country’s feat as the most vibrant innovation hub on the African continent. “There are promising start-ups in Nigeria. Many of these companies started business in 2015 and prospered in the midst of two recessions and the two years of COVID-19”, he added.
