Manchester United midfielder, Fred has tipped the club to win the Champions League this season. The Brazilian star insisted Manchester United being crowned Champions League winners this season is not completely out of the question. The Red Devils face Atletico Madrid in the Champions League round of sixteen on Wednesday, being their only chance of winning a trophy this season. And while probably not even the most optimistic of Red Devils’ fans would think the Old Trafford landlords have a chance of lifting Europe’s most prestigious club trophy, Fred insists it ‘would’t be crazy’ if they lifted it in May. Asked if it is crazy to picture United winning the Champions League this year, Fred told TNT Sports Brazil, “I don’t think so. “I know we’re not playing our best football, but we have a lot of quality names in our squad. I see many other teams playing far off from their best as well. “[To win it] wouldn’t be crazy, it could happen, but we have to work our socks off because we’re far away from being one of the favourites in this competition.”
