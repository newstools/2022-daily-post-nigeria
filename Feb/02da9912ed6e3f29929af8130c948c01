Manchester United goalkeeper, David De Gea, has claimed the club is “cursed”. The Spaniard, speaking to El Pais, said he could not explain why they have fallen behind their rivals in the Premier League. De Gea won the title in his second season at Old Trafford, before lifting the FA Cup in 2016 and both the League Cup and Europa League in 2017 respectively. United have not won any silverware since that time. The trophy drought is likely to be extended this campaign, as the Champions League is the only realistic chance of trophy left for Ralf Rangnick’s men. Since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, United employed four different managers and spent almost £1billion on players. “I think someone has put a curse on us or something. “The truth is I don’t know what’s going on, I really don’t. “People always ask me and we talk about it as team-mates and we just say “we don’t know what’s happening”. “We should have competed for more trophies, bigger titles, but I just don’t know why this team doesn’t function,” De Gea said.
