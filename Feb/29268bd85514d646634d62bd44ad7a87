The sit-at-home home order given by the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, on Wednesday, grounded commercial activities in Onitsha, Nnewi, Awka, and other cities in Anambra State. DAILY POST observed that major businesses, including banks, motor parks, filling stations, markets, schools and roadside shops were shut, due to the order. All roads in the cities mentioned were devoid of vehicular movement, just as it was difficult to find even pedestrians in many areas. A source said even the numerous police and military checkpoints around Anambra were not manned, just as the River Niger Bridge in Onitsha, which is usually a beehive of activities on a normal day was deserted. Though the IPOB had called off the Monday sit at home, people in the southeast have continued to observe it. The group said official days for the sit at home would only be days when its leader, Nnamdi Kanu would be taken to court. It was, however, gathered that Kanu’s matter in Abuja was on Wednesday adjourned to Thursday. This may lead to another round of sit at home, which will make it three days in just one week.
