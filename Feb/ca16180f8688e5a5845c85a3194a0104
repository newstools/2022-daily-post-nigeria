All Russian football teams have been issued indefinite bans from international football following the invasion of Ukraine, UEFA and FIFA have announced. This means Russia would not be allowed to play in this 2022 World Cup, having hosted the previous tournament in 2018. UEFA have also ended their £40million-a-year sponsorship with Russian state-owned energy firm, Gazprom, as Russia’s sporting exile continues. The governing bodies have been under immense pressure from members and politicians to take action against Russia following their military action in Ukraine, which began last Thursday. Poland over the weekend refused to play their upcoming world World Cup qualifier with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Also, International football associations, including The FA and Scottish FA had said that they would not face Russian sides at any level for the foreseeable future.
