An ex-Communications Director of the Ghana Football Association (GFA), Ibrahim Sannie Daara, has said appointing Borussia Dortmund assistant coach Otto Addo as the new head coach of the national team, will be the wisest thing to do. The Black Stars are yet to have a new handler after Milovan Rajevac was dismissed following a dismal outing at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. Addo and former Newcastle United manager, Chris Hughton have emerged as the two leading candidates for the role. Ghana is set to host Nigeria in the 2020 World Cup playoffs first, before travelling to Abuja for the reverse fixture. “We’re just about four weeks to playing against Nigeria. Anything other than being focused on that match, is us shooting ourselves in the foot. “And I say these things for two reasons, while journalists have been sent on a wild goose chase, the Nigerians are focused. “The wisest thing the GFA can do is to look for somebody that knows the squad, that knows the players, has worked with the players, knows the psyche of Ghanaian players and can move to stabilize the team in the midst of this outing in the Afcon that does not impress all of us, so that we can go with a strong face to face Nigeria,” Daara told Joy FM. Addo was one of two Rajevac assistant coaches during the Serbian’s reign, but was unable to join the team in Cameroon owing to club commitments.
