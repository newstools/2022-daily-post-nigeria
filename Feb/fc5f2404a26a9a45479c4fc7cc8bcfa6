Barcelona manager, Xavi Hernandez, has claimed they were unlucky with their Europa League draw. The LaLiga side will face Napoli in the round of 32 on Thursday. Both teams played each other in the Champions League last 16 two years ago. Xavi says the fact they now face the Serie A in the Europa League shows the strength of the competition. “We were unlucky with the draw. Napoli are a Champions League-level side. It is going to be a difficult tie. I would not say we’re favourites [for the competition or the tie]. “It is an open draw. Napoli are one of the toughest teams in the competition and we have to play the second leg away from home next week. There are other teams, like Sevilla, in this competition with a lot of experience. We’re candidates, but I would not say favourites,” Xavi said.
