General Abdulsalami Abubakar, former Head of State, has noted that Nigeria is at war and is facing a hard time. Abubakar regretted that this ‘war without morality’ has spread across all corners of the country where people slaughter themselves at any slightest provocations. The former military leader stated this at the 30th convocation of the Federal University of Technology (FUT) Minna, the Niger State capital, on Wednesday. “We are facing a hard time, security-wise. The war front is everywhere. This is a war without any morality, where the old and the young are slaughtered without any cause,” he said. Abubakar pointed out that the country’s security forces are overstretched, calling on all Nigerians to join hands in making sure that information is provided to them where possible. Speaking further, he said, “As we go into politics, caution Nigerians and politicians. Please, wisely play the game. Avoid using our children and grandchildren for propaganda and …trying to make them do what we know is wrong. “And for the youths, please, avoid being used as thugs and purveyors of disharmony and violence in the country.”
