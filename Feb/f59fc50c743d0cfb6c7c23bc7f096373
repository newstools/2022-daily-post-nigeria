Chelsea stars, Cesar Azpilicueta and Edouard Mendy, on Saturday, made history following their side’s FIFA Club World Cup final win against Palmeiras. Chelsea defeated Palmeiras 2-1 in the FIFA Club World Cup final played at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Romelu Lukaku scored for Chelsea in the 55 minutes before Raphael Veiga equalized for the Brazilian side nine minutes later from the spot-kick. The match ended in a 1-1 draw after normal time but Kai Havertz netted a late penalty in the second half of extra-time to give Chelsea their first FIFA Club World Cup. The victory over Palmeiras means Azpilicueta is now the first player in Chelsea’s history to win every major trophy – Premier League, Champions League, Europa League, FA Cup, League Cup, Super Cup and Club World Cup, available at Stamford Bridge. Mendy, on the other hand, is now the first African to win Super Cup, Champions League, Club World and AFCON in a year. Chelsea will now face Crystal Palace in the Premier League in their next fixture on February 19.
