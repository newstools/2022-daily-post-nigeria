Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, wants Nigerian striker, Victor Osimhen to replace Cristiano Ronaldo at Old Trafford. This claim was made by respected Italian journalist, Ciro Venerato. Reports had emerged that Ronaldo could be leaving Man United at the end of the season due to the club’s poor results, quality of the squad and problems in the dressing room so far this season. According to Venerato, Manchester United are targeting a summer move for Osimhen as a replacement for Ronaldo. Osimhen continues to be linked with a transfer to the Premier League ahead of the upcoming summer transfer window, with Arsenal and Newcastle United also mentioned as possible destinations for the Super Eagles attacker. But Venerato believes that Napoli’s owner, Aurelio De Laurentiis, would be forced to do business with one of Osimhen’s suitors if the Serie A club received a bid in the region of 100 million euros. “Manchester United focuses on the Nigerian, Rangnick wants him to replace Cristiano Ronaldo,” Venerato said on La Domenica Sportiva, according to calcioinpillole. “The club and the player have already been probed, with President De Laurentiis valuing him 100 million. “At the same time, Napoli asked Sassuolo for information for Scamacca, considered by Spalletti as the best possible heir of Osimhen.” Osimhen’s current contract with Napoli will expire in the summer of 2023. The 23-year-old joined Napoli from French Ligue 1 side Lille in 2020.
