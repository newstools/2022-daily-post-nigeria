Ahead of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) congresses in Anambra State slated for Saturday, February 19 to Saturday, March 5, 2022, the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party directed members of the Caretaker Committee that are interested in contesting for any position to resign. The party’s directive was contained in a statement made available to journalists in Abuja on Thursday by its National Organizing Secretary, Hon. Umar M. Bature. According to the statement, the resignation of members of the Caretaker Committee that are interested in contesting for any position will ensure a level playing field for all contestants during the Congresses. “For purposes of verification, all resignation letters are to be directed to the office of the National Organizing Secretary. Failure by such aspirants to adhere to the resignation directives renders his or her contest invalid,” the statement read. The opposition party urged all critical stakeholders, aspirants, to various positions and members of the party in Anambra State to remain focused and united in the overall efforts to rescue and rebuild Nigeria from misrule.
