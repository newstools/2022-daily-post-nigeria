The House of Representatives, on Wednesday, urged the Inspector General of Police (IGP), the Director-General, Department of State Security (DSS) and other security agencies to deploy officers to Ijesha land, Osun State. This is to arrest the killing of innocent Nigerians by suspected cultists operating in the area. The resolution followed the adoption of a motion of urgent public importance by Rep. Lawrence Ayeni (APC-Osun) on the floor of the House in Abuja. In his motion, Ayeni noted that Atakumosa East/Atakumosa West, Ilesha East and Ilesha West Federal Constituency of Osun State had been the most peaceful localities in the South West region of the country. He, however, noted that the inglorious activities of suspected members of the yet to be identified cultist group, had over the past three months, led to the murder of unsuspecting residents in the area. According to him, on Feb. 7, members of the dreadful cultist group in broad daylight killed five persons. “Those who were hurt by stray bullets and sustained various degrees of injury were taken to Wesley Hospital in Ilesha East for medical treatment. “The day for the All Progressives Congress (APC) party primary, a group of political thugs who drove in a branded vehicle of a certain political party, invaded the venue of the party primary and unleashed attacks on the voters,” he said. He said that the group succeeded in killing one person before they escaped from the incident, adding that the security agencies pursued them and recovered the vehicle used for the operation. “On Feb. 21, seven persons were killed in Irojo by the suspected cultists around 7.30 pm, barely an hour after a peace meeting by some community leaders and the Osun State Commissioner of Police,” he said. He said that residents of the areas could no longer sleep with their two eyes closed at night and were unable to go about their lawful businesses during the day following life-threatening incidents.
