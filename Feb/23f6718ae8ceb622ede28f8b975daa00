Arsenal have signed documents confirming they have terminated Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s contract with the club. The 32-year-old now has the all-clear to sign for Barcelona as a free agent. This was confirmed by Italian transfer expert, Fabrizio Romano, on Tuesday morning via his verified Twitter page. Romano wrote: “Arsenal have counter-signed paperworks for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s contract termination today morning. Barcelona announcement finally in place.” The Gabon striker is now expected to be officially unveiled by the Spanish giants later in the day. Aubameyang leaves Arsenal after four years with the Premier League, after falling out with manager Mikel Arteta. Arteta removed Aubameyang as captain in December following a disciplinary breach.
