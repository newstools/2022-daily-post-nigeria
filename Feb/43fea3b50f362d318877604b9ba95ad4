Chelsea legend, John Terry has sent a message to Thomas Tuchel’s men ahead of their FIFA Club World Cup final tie with Palmeiras on Saturday evening. Chelsea will face Palmeiras in the FIFA Club World Cup final fixture at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The Premier League giants head to the game following a 1-0 victory against Al Hilal in the FIFA Club World Cup semi-final tie a few days ago, while Palmeiras defeated Al Ahly 2-0. But Terry has now urged Chelsea players not to give Palmeiras anything in the first 15 minutes of the encounter, wishing them good luck against the Brazilian side. In a tweet via his Twitter handle, Terry said: “Big game tonight. The one trophy missing from our cabinet.” “It’s important we start well and don’t give Palmeiras anything in the first 15 mins. Good Luck @ChelseaFC.” The kick-off time for Chelsea vs Palmeiras is 5:30 pm.
