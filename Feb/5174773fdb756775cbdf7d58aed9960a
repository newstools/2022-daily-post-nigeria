Chelsea defender, Antonio Rudiger, has revealed the secrets behind manager Thomas Tuchel’s success at Stamford Bridge so far. Tuchel took over the reins at Chelsea in early 2021 following the sacking of Frank Lampard. The German gaffer guided Chelsea to Champions League glory and a top-four finish in the Premier League during his first season. Although their Premier League title challenge has faltered this season, Tuchel’s men won the FIFA Club World Cup earlier this month and face Liverpool in the final of the Carabao Cup on Sunday. But Rudiger believes Tuchel’s secret to success at Chelsea is his honest approach. “I think Thomas’ secret is that he is just honest,” Rudiger told PA news agency. “He is just honest with how he goes about things.” He added, “He demands a lot, but that is normal. This is high, high-quality football and we want to be successful. “So if you want to be successful, you’ve to be honest, you’ve to be straightforward in the way of working, and apply to the cause. “A coach is a general, he has his way and at the end of the day, as players, we’ve to do our best to follow. “What he has achieved since he has been here, speaks for itself.”
