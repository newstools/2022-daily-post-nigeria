Leicester City manager, Brendan Rodgers, has insisted Wilfried Ndidi is “worth more than £50 million” as the player continues to be linked with a move to Aston Villa. Ndidi, who joined the Foxes from Genk in 2017, is also attracting interest from Manchester United and other top clubs. The 25-year-old Nigerian midfielder, who is contracted until 2024, is said to now be a top target for Villa manager, Steven Gerrard, who will reportedly sanction a £50million bid next summer. When that figure was put to Rodgers at a press conference on Wednesday, he said: “He’s worth much more than that.” Rodgers also admitted that good players always attract interest, but believes Ndidi is happy at the King Power Stadium. “It’s both of those things – it’s how it works. “A player of that quality and mentality, of course, you want to always keep, but when you have that player, he will always attract interest. “But he seems very settled here. I know he’s moved into a new house and he seems very, very happy. He’s a pleasure to work with and hopefully, he can be around the club for many years,” Rodgers added.
