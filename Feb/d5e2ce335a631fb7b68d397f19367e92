The Presidency on Monday said President Muhammadu Buhari still has more days to decide on signing the amended Electoral Bill into law. A statement issued by Mr Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, tackled some groups and individuals accusing the president of being reluctant in assenting to the controversial bill. According to Adesina, the Nigerian constitution gives the president the window of 30 days to scrutinize the bill after it has been transmitted by the National Assembly, stressing that Buhari has from now till March 1st to decline or sign the bill into law. DAILY POST reports that after amending the bill, the National Assembly, on January 31, 2022, transmitted it to the executive for signing. The statement reads, “Some interest groups are cashing in on what they consider a delay in the signing of the Electoral Bill into law by the President to foment civil disorder and muddy the waters. “One can just pity their ignorance of Constitutional requirements, as the President has a window of 30 days within which to sign the Bill, or decline assent after it had been transmitted to him by the National Assembly. “A proposed legislation that has to do with the electoral fortunes of the country needs to be thoroughly scrutinized, and be made as near-perfect as possible. “Those playing cheap politics with it are, therefore, encouraged to hold their peace, knowing that the right thing will be done within the lawful time”.
