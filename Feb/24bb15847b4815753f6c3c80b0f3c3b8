Operatives of the Kogi State Police Command on Sunday shot one person dead when hoodlums attacked the Okene Police Area Command. SP Williams Oyve-Aya, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), said this on Monday in a statement. Oyve-Aya said “at about 10 p.m. on Sunday, some armed hoodlums attacked the Okene Area Command Headquarters with sporadic gunshots and explosives. “The officers on duty repelled the attack; and in the process, shot dead one of the attackers, a situation that forced the hoodlums to flee even before the arrival of police back-up teams from the neighbouring divisions.” The command spokesman, who said that normalcy had returned to the Okene community, said that a thorough search for the arrest of the hoodlums has begun. “The commissioner of police has deployed re-enforcement team to the area, comprising Counter Terrorism Units, Police Mobile Force and Intelligence team. “Also deployed are Quick Response Unit along with the Military and other security forces with a view to tracking the perpetrators and bring them to book. “The police commissioner is hereby assuring all law-abiding citizens of Kogi of his commitment in discharging his mandate in synergy with other heads of security agencies in the state to ensure a safe and secure environment for all,’’ the statement added.
