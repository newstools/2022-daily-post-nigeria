Super Eagles coach, Emmanuel Amuneke, has hailed Leicester City’s Ademola Lookman as a great addition to the national team ahead of the World Cup playoffs against Ghana in March. Lookman has been cleared by FIFA to switch allegiance from England to Nigeria. Amuneke says Lookman, who won the 2017 U17 World Cup with England, will add value to the Super Eagles. “He is a great addition to the team, a player who is ready to give his best anytime he is called upon. “Playing regularly for Leicester City shows he has come of age and ready for the big occasion. “That explains why we need him in our fold. “I am happy he has agreed to join,” Amuneke said.
