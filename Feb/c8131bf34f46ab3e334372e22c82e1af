Osun State Government, on Thursday, raised the alarm that fake paramilitary uniforms have arrived in the state ahead of the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship primary slated for Saturday. The Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Mrs. Funke Egbemode, raised the alarm in a statement on Thursday. Egbemode stated that the government was in possession of an intelligence report that some persons had stockpiled paramilitary uniforms with intent to distribute them to non-state actors for use during the primary. The commissioner, who warned those behind the plot to jettison the idea, said security operatives had been put on the alert and mandated to deal decisively with anyone bent on causing violence and destruction in the state. “We warn those behind this plot to jettison the idea as security operatives have been put on the alert to deal decisively with anyone bent on causing violence and destruction in Osun State. “We also appeal to parents and guardians to rein in their children and wards so as not to lend themselves as tools in the hands of merchants of death and instability. “Osun is known for peace, and as a responsive and responsible government, we are ready to take all legitimate steps to guard the enviable status very jealously,’’ she added.
