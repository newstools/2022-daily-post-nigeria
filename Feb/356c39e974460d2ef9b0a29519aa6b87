President Muhammadu Buhari’s wife, Aisha, has joined Nigerian parents in prayers and solidarity for the safe evacuation of their children and Nigerian students trapped in the troubled nation of Ukraine. She expressed her position on Friday in her Instagram account. Mrs Buhari, however, commended the Federal Government’s directive on the evacuation of 5,600 Nigerian students trapped in Ukraine. She wrote: ”In view of the state of heightened insecurity in Ukraine, I stand with all Nigerian parents in praying for global peace and human solidarity. ”I commend the directives of (the) federal government and the House of Representatives for the evacuation of our more than 5,600 students trapped in the conflict. She added, ”The Minister of Foreign Affairs should treat this matter as an emergency, while our citizens should stay calm, comply with safety procedures and avoid self-help in order to avoid the mischief of human traffickers.” On Thursday, Russia invaded Ukraine after weeks of rising political tensions. The conflict escalated on Friday, with reports of fighting within the capital city of Kyiv.
