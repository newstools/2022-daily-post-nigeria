Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp, has commented on Luis Diaz’s performance following his side’s FA Cup fourth-round 3-1 victory against Cardiff City on Sunday. Klopp described Diaz’s display for Liverpool against Cardiff City as ‘good’. Diaz, who joined Liverpool in the January transfer window, came off the bench in Liverpool’s FA Cup victory against Cardiff City. He provided an assist during the encounter as three goals from Diogo Jota, Takumi Minamino and Elliott bagged ensured Liverpool defeated Cardiff City and qualified for the FA Cup fifth-round. Speaking to ITV Sport after the game, Klopp said: “Luis came on and now has just a bruise and a little cut, everybody thought: “Welcome to England!” But there will be a scar at the end, so he knows what he did in the first game. But all good!” The German added: “He is good, thank god. It was a scary moment. The goal he set up for Taki was absolutely incredible. The high press, counter press, I love it! And then Taki finished it off.” Meanwhile, Liverpool will now face Norwich City in the FA Cup fifth-round later this month.
