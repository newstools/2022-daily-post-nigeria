Former Chelsea ace, Craig Burley has slammed the club’s players, saying they ’embarrassed’ themselves by celebrating a ‘nonsense’ Club World Cup victory against Palmeiras while Manchester City are running away with the Premier League title. Burley said the Blues are ‘salivating’ over their win in Abu Dhabi while Manchester City and Liverpool are battling for a more prestigious EPL title. Romelu Lukaku and Kai Havertz scored to beat the South American side 2-1 while Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City beat Norwich and Brentford to extend their lead over the Blues to 16 points. “I get it they’re off playing in it but I don’t watch this competition, I think it’s nonsense,” Burley told ESPN. “They’re off salivating about winning it. you’ve got Lukaku scoring a good header, you’ve got Havertz scoring a penalty. Do it when it matters! “They’re off celebrating like they’ve won the World Cup, City have racked up a 16-point lead on Chelsea. “And they’re off celebrating out there like they’re the greatest thing since sliced bread. It’s embarrassing. “The Club World Cup is nonsense. It’s a showpiece event, it’s a plastic trophy. “I don’t buy a £100m striker to win the bloody Club World Cup. “They’re 16 points behind, they haven’t got a chance of winning it this year and the way they’re playing they don’t have a chance next year. “So spare me this plastic fans, plastic cup, Club World Cup nonsense.”
