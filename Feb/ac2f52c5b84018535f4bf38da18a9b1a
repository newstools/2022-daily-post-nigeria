A Civil Society Organisations, Transition Monitoring Group, TMG, has said Nigeria is not ripe for the domination of the political space by the two main parties, the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Mr. Auwal Rafsanjani, Chairman, TMG, told NAN on Sunday that the situation of two-party system has created a serious threat to multi-party democracy in the country. Rafsanjani alleged that the APC and PDP have practically hijacked public offices and were also controlling the electoral process through their influence. The TMG chairman also alleged that some state governors use their security votes to finance political parties, thereby causing Nigerians to have limited options and choices to contest for elections and get into political parties in the country. He said that the situation had made options for Nigerians very limited to explore other political parties to vie for political offices. According to him, “The two parties use public tax payers money to control other smaller political parties especially because they’re the ones who have governors and control over public sector resources. ”They have been able to use their resources to expand their control of political parties and membership in Nigeria. “So two party system is a threat because it’s limiting public choice, it’s a threat because public taxpayers’ money is now used for the wrong things.” He urged other viable political parties with the potential to engage in the forthcoming election to showcase themselves and be able to draw membership and followership.
