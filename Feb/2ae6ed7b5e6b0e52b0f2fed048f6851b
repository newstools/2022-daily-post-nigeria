Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has condemned the withdrawal of officers assigned to House of Representatives member, Shina Peller. DCC Odumosu Olusola, Director of Public Relations, said the action was unauthorized. The spokesman, in a statement Wednesday night, said the officer who signed the letter did so without recourse to the constituted authority. “Not only did the officer in question lacked the power to do such, he was also found to have acted on his whims without clearance,” he noted. Commandant-General, Ahmed Audi, directed a reinstatement of the withdrawn officers “with a compliment of necessary courtesies”, Olusola added. Shina Peller had asked the National Assembly to push for absorption of the NSCDC by the police over duplication of responsibilities.
