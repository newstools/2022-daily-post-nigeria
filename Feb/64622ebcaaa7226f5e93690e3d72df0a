Nigerian afrobeat musician, Femi Kuti, has said he would love to be cremated when he dies. Cremation is the process of reducing a dead body to mostly tiny bits of bone resembling ash that involves exposing the body to flame and intense heat followed by pulverization of bone fragments. The 59-year-old entertainer said this during a performance at the New Afrika Shrine on Sunday. Kuti said he wants the funeral attended by close friends and family members without a loud burial ceremony. He said: “When I die, please cremate me, burn my body. It’s the most hygienic way.” Femi wondered what happens to corpses at cemeteries, adding that the cemeteries in Lagos are not filled up. “Have you thought about Ikoyi cemetery? This Lagos has been in existence for let’s just say 60 years and people die; if they don’t die today, they die tomorrow and that burial ground has never been full. “And if you check it, it’s not like it’s one million acres since I was little when we used to bury people there,” Kuti said.
