Egypt head coach, Carlos Queiroz, has claimed that referee, Bakary Gassama came into their dressing room to “intimidate” his staff, before their semi-final victory over hosts Cameroon. The Pharaohs defeated the Indomitable Lion 3-1 on penalties, after the game ended goalless in 120 minutes. Queiroz was shown a red card just before the second half ended. He slammed Afcon officials after receiving a red card during his side’s semi-final win over Cameroon. The Portuguese coach was sent to the stands after confronting Gassama late in normal time. After the game, Queiroz told reporters: “Again, unfortunately, they send this type of referee to a game of this level, referees with no experience, no level, wanting to put on a show… It started right in the dressing room. “We hadn’t started the game yet and he came to the locker room to intimidate our staff. But even against this, against all the decisions, which were always against Egypt, we were the best team in the second half and on penalties.”
