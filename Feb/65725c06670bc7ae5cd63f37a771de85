Paris Saint-Germain forward, Kylian Mbappe, has reached an agreement to join Real Madrid in the summer, according to BILD. The agreement will see Mbappe sign for Los Blancos as a free agent. The 23-year-old’s contract with PSG expires June 30, but he has so far rejected every extension the Ligue 1 club has offered him. Mbappe will earn 50 million euros gross per season at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu, which would make him the highest-paid player in the world. The deal between the two parties will not be made official before the Champions League last-16 tie between Real Madrid and PSG is over. It is also understood PSG have given up on convincing Mbappe to remain at the Parc des Princes.
