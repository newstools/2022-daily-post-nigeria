Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Tuesday said Nigeria’s public health system can deal with any situation if well-resourced. Osinbajo stated this on Tuesday when he received, on a courtesy visit to the Presidential Villa in Abuja, a delegation from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Osinbajo’s spokesman, Mr Laolu Akande, disclosed this in a statement today. The delegation was led by its President, Dr Christopher Elias and accompanied by Alhaji Aliko Dangote, founder of the Dangote Foundation. “Clearly, we need to do a lot more, perhaps what needs to happen is increasing personnel in our public healthcare system, ramping up the numbers, so that we can achieve greater coverage and do a lot more,” Osinbajo said. “I am confident that our public health system is robust enough to deal with any situation so long as it is well resourced at the relevant times. “We saw that with the response to COVID-19; so, it’s really just ensuring that the system is well resourced and it works, and we will be able to deliver on those targets.” Osinbajo also thanked both the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Dangote Foundation for their support in Nigeria’s healthcare system. The VP said the Federal Government looked forward to more collaboration with partners for the benefit of the Nigerian people.
