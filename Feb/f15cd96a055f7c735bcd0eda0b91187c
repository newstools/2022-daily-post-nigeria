Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, has identified Jadon Sancho as the player he is impressed, with following their Premier League 1-1 draw with Southampton on Saturday. Rangnick said Sancho’s performance against Southampton was the best he has seen from the England international so far. Two goals from Sancho and Che Adam ensured both Man United and Southampton played a draw at Old Trafford. Speaking after the game, Rangnick told BT Sport: “Jadon is in good shape, not only in the first half but also in the second half he had his good moments. “With Jadon’s performances in the last couple of weeks, I’m very pleased. “This is the Jadon Sancho that I know from the German Bundesliga. There is still more space for improvement from him, but in the way that he is playing right now, it’s the best Jadon Sancho that Manchester United has seen so far.” Man United’s next game is against Brighton on Tuesday.
