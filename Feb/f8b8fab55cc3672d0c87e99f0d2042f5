The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Council, FCCPC, and the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, NCAA, have resolved to investigate the current increase in airfares. Speaking during a press conference in Abuja, the executive vice-chairman of FCCPC, Babatunde Irukera, said the investigation would be focused on finding out whether airlines breached regulations while fixing the new base price of N50,000. Irukera, however, stated that the airlines have the right to change prices but must follow due procedure before arriving at a price that would favour both the industry and travelers. He said, “We are not saying that they are wrong to change the price they will charge their passengers, but we want to know if there is a breach of procedure in fixing it. This is a free market, but we need to know if the new price was fixed with fairness to passengers”. Also speaking, the Director-General of the NCAA, Capt. Musa Nuhu, said the Joint Technical Committee of the FCCPC and NCAA would be meeting stakeholders within the week to unravel whether due processes were followed before arriving at the current fare price. The DG, who admitted that the airline industry is currently facing several challenges birthed by the effects of COVID-19 and hike in aviation fuel, condemned abrupt increment by the airline operators, stating that regulatory requirements must be followed. He identified the cost of fuel and foreign exchange as major factors affecting the operation of the industry. He said, “The industry is going through a difficult time and COVID-19 hit us so hard. We are just in the process of recovering. “But the due process and regulatory requirements must be followed to make the relevant changes in such a manner that the consumers, the traveling public do not get the shock of it”.
