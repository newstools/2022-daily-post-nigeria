Dr Aghogho Owhojede has revealed that Sylvester Oromoni, the late Dowen College student, was not taken to a hospital for treatment. NAN reports that Owhojede, the Oromonis’ family doctor for 15 years, testified before an Ikeja Coroner’s Court on Tuesday. The medical doctor was questioned by counsel to Dowen College, two accused students, the Lagos State Government and the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA). He recalled treating the teenager for acute malaria at the family home in Warri, Delta, from November 26 to 30, 2021. Owhojede also told Akin George, Lagos State Government counsel, that he attended the same God’s Grace Ministry International Church with the family. The doctor added that Oromoni was taken to church for prayers for an unspecified number of days by parents. “What was your response to the treatment at a church as opposed to a proper medical facility?” George asked. “I am aware that the church is not a treatment centre. I am not against prayer, I will prefer a combination of both prayer and medical treatment,” the doctor replied. The doctor disclosed that on the day Oromoni died, he referred him to Delta State University Teaching Hospital, Oghara, for further treatment. Owhojede said the boy could not be taken there because his condition deteriorated and he gave up the ghost. The Coroner, Mikhail Kadiri, adjourned proceedings until February 7 for continuation of the hearing. Dowen College gives update on investigation of Sylvester’s death, reveals next action
