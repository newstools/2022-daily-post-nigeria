University students across Nigeria will know their fate regarding the proposed strike action by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). DAILY POST gathered that as of Sunday evening, the meeting called by the National Executive Council (NEC) of the union which commenced on Saturday, was still ongoing as at the time of filing this report. It was also gathered that no decision has been reached on whether to proceed on the strike or not. The meeting of the NEC of ASUU is currently being held at the F. Ade Ajayi Main Auditorium of the University of Lagos (UNILAG), Akoka. There are clear indications that the crucial meeting may go on into the night today, while a media conference expected to be addressed by ASUU’s National President, Professor Emmanuel Osodeke is scheduled for Monday, 14 February. Recall that the battle of witts between ASUU and the Federal Government is hinged on the revitalisation of public universities, earned academic allowances, University Transparency Accountability Solution (UTAS) promotion arrears, implementation of the renegotiated 2009 ASUU-FGN agreement and discrepancies in the implementation of the Integrated Payroll and Personnel information system (IPPIS). While the union chides the government for breaching previous negotiations of these agreements, the latter has accused ASUU of forcing it to enter into such pact under duress. At the ongoing stakeholders meeting, delegates present are expected to vote in favour or against a decision to embark on the nationwide strike. All these come just as students and parents have been on the edge over the implications of embarking on a fresh strike. Recall also that President Muhammadu Buhari recently assured that the Federal Government would ensure it honours all existing agreements with ASUU but that appeals not to have assuaged the feelings of the academicians.
