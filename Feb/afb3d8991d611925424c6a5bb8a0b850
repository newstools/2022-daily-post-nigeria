Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, says the All Progressives Congress (APC) will dethrone the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Delta State next year. Omo-Agege made the declaration on Wednesday in Asaba at the inauguration of APC executives. The DSP noted that the event was a milestone in the battle to “sack the PDP” from the Government House. “Our goal now is to defeat Okowa and whoever he is planning to impose on the people of Delta,” NAN quoted him saying. The lawmaker reminded party faithful the need to work hard ahead of the general elections. Omo-Agege advised the exco to extend a hand of fellowship to others, irrespective of their lineage. The senator told them not to forget the common goal, close ranks and work in unity. “Let us forgive and forget our differences, because if we must win, we must be united in battle.” Omo-Agege charged members to convince the people at the grassroots to vote for the APC in 2023. “Our people have suffered enough. Let the people know we are coming to wipe away their sufferings,” he said.
