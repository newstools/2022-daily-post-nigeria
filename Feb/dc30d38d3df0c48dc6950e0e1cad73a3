The Gombe State Government has condemned, in the strongest terms, the activities of some yet-to-be-identified suspected political thugs who set ablaze an All Progressives Congress (APC) office as well as another political party’s office in the state. A statement on Monday by Julius Ishaya Lepes, the state Commissioner of Information and Culture, indicated that the act “showed that desperation is the trademark of some power and bloodthirsty people who lost control of the state treasury and are hell-bent on returning, and so have resorted to unleashing violence on the peaceful polity of the State which is the envy of other states”. He reminded those who are engaging in acts of violence and their sponsors that, in democracy, the only means of getting to power is through the ballot box. “We also wish to state categorically clear that the government of Alh. Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya will continue to do everything to ensure the protection of people’s lives and property. “We will bring all the perpetrators of this dastardly act to book,” Lepes assured. The commissioner commended security agents in the state for promptly bringing the situation under control while pledging to continue to give all security operatives in the state the needed support to deal decisively with everyone that will bring about the breaking of peace in the state. “For the avoidance of doubt, our government will not spare anybody regardless of his or her position who intends to disrupt the current peaceful coexistence which this government laboured to create and sustain”, he stated. The information and culture commissioner, however, encouraged the peace-loving and law-abiding citizens of the state to continue following the path of peace in their respective endeavours and be law-abiding in all their dealings.
