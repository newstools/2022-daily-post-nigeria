Paris Saint-Germain manager, Mauricio Pochettino, has said his players lacked “a little aggressiveness in the last third”, despite their 1-0 win over Real Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday. The Ligue 1 side will travel to Spain with a narrow advantage in the round of 16, following Kylian Mbappe’s stunning solo effort late in the game. Lionel Messi missed a second-half penalty but Pochettino was content with the lead they will take to Madrid. But Pochettino said: “I’m very happy for the players, who deserve it. I think the result is a bit short, but it gives us hope for Madrid knowing that it’s going to be very complicated. “We cut the Madrid circuit with good pressure, their collective play with incredible players in midfield. We have recovered a lot in the opposite field to Madrid and we have forced them to play in the opposite field. “We lacked perhaps a little aggressiveness in the last third. We have made a great effort and the commitment of the team is very good. We took risks but we were very vigilant.”
