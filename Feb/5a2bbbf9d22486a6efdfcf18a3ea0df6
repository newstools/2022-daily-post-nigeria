Former Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, has urged Nigerians to elect competent leaders in 2023 because “we are living on extra-time.” Sanusi made the remark while urging Pastors, Bishops, and Imams to tell politicians the truth about the fear of God. The former Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Governor spoke yesterday in Abeokuta, Ogun State. Sanusi pointed out that jumping into politics is not the solution to Nigeria’s problems. According to Sanusi: “We should look at all the candidates very well. We should choose people that we think are competent and honest. “To be honest, we are living on extra time. In 2015, we were in a deep hole. In 2023, we will be in an even much deeper hole than in 2015. “The solution is not for all of us to jump into politics, this country needs good politicians, it needs imams and pastors and bishops who are going to stand up and remind the politicians about the fear of God. “I think the most important thing is that we should continue to pray for our country that whoever emerges as President, governors, senators, members of the House, leadership at all levels, that we get good leaders”.
