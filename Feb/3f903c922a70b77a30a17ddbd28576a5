A governorship aspirant under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Ebonyi State chapter, Mr Chris Usulor, has described as kangaroo, the sitting of 15 lawmakers of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, where they declared the seats of three PDP members including the deputy speaker, Obasi Odefa, vacant. Usulor, a third time member of the Ebonyi State house of Assembly and representing Ezza South Constituency, made this known while briefing journalists in Abakaliki, the state capital. He faulted the sitting of the 15 lawmakers, saying there was no proper communication to other members of the house, notifying them of the said sitting. According to him: “There was a kangaroo sitting of the members of the Ebonyi State House of Assembly. There was no proper communication to the members of the house. Few people went there and said that they have declared the seat of the deputy speaker, Rt. Hon. Obasi Odefa vacant, which is highly unconstitutional. “I stand here to say that there was no proper sitting. There was no impeachment because they didn’t have the required number to do impeachment or remove our members from the house. “There was no declaration of seats of our members vacant. It was just a statement of arbitrariness and it can never stand. It doesn’t hold in law. “Obasi Odefa Obasi remains the authentic deputy speaker of Ebonyi State House of Assembly. Generally, nothing happened in the house that day. Like, I said, it was a collection of a few people who went to the house and made a press conference. “There was no sitting, there was no proper convocation of the house since last year December. There was no proper constitutional sitting of that house. A quorum was not even formed, so, a statement was just issued and I want the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to regard it as just a statement.”
