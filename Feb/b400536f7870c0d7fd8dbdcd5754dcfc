The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has urged Nigerian youths to focus on hard work and creativity. The apex religious organization condemned the “crazy idea of get-rich-quick-syndrome” on Friday. CAN Chairman in South-East, Rev. Fr. Abraham Nwali, spoke at an event organized by the Youth Wing Christian Association of Nigeria (YOWICAN). He advised youths to pursue a profession in order to contribute to the present and future wellbeing of the society. Mwali told them to exercise patience, work hard and put God first in all they do. “Be creative for tomorrow’s sake, not for today. Focus on becoming someone great”, NAN quoted him saying. “Youths should not be deceived. God is the One that owns genuine wealth. Learn from great men in history, they did not make it overnight”. The cleric added that in the fullness of time, God rewards hard work, innovation and perseverance. CAN further cautioned young Nigerians against the use of hard drugs and friendship with bad peers. “All tiers of government should prioritize employment and skill acquisition provisions for youths,” Nwali added.
