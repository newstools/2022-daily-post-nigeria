Former Arsenal and Tottenham stars, Jack Wilshere and Darren Bent, have said that Tottenham boss, Antonio Conte will leave the club if they fail to qualify for the Champions League next season. Tottenham are currently battling for Premier League top four finish with the likes of Manchester United, West Ham United and Arsenal all hoping to take the last Champions League spot. Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea have already occupied the first, second and third spots. Spurs are struggling with form and are on a disastrous run of form and Conte took aim at the club during a recent interview with Sky Italia, saying they are now ‘weaker’ after the January window Tottenham brought in Rodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski from Juventus but before then, four senior players were allowed to leave the club in the persons of Tanguy Ndomble, Dele Alli, Bryan Gil and Giovani Lo Celso. Asked if the Italian will be Tottenham’s manager next season, if they don’t get top four, Wilshere told talkSPORT, “No.” And Bent added, “Nope! He’s gone!”
