Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, has continued to witness long queues of cars, motorcycles and tricycles due to the closure of many petrol stations. Our correspondent had last week reported that long queues resurfaced in most parts of Ibadan. A DAILY POST correspondent, who went round major areas of Ibadan last week, observed that long queues have resurfaced in most of the petroleum stations in the ancient city. Recall that the country had in the last few weeks been witnessing long queues due to an alarm raised by the federal government that adulterated petroleum products have been imported into the country. This made many petroleum stations to close against prospective buyers of the product.  DAILY POST reports that the situation has remained the same in Ibadan as the queues persist across the city. It was observed by our correspondent that the situation has become worse for motorists, commercial cab operator, motorcyclists, tricycles among others. Some of the areas visited by DAILY POST include Sango, Bodija, Iwo Road, Monatan, Iyana Church and Total Garden. It was observed that most of the petroleum stations in these areas have closed while only few that opened are currently experiencing long queues. While many have increased their prices, only few that belong to major marketers have maintained the old prices. Effort made by DAILY POST to get a reaction from Chairman, Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Oyo State branch, Mr. Bukola Mutiu, proved abortive as calls put through to his phone were not answered.
