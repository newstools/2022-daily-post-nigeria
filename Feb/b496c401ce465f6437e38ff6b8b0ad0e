Former England striker, Gary Lineker, has given his verdict on Middlebrough’s equalizer against Manchester United in the FA Cup fourth-round encounter on Friday night. Middlesbrough had scored a controversial equalizer against Manchester United in the FA Cup fourth-round tie at Old Trafford. Man United had taken the lead through Jadon Sancho in the first half, but Middlesbrough made it 1-1 through Matt Crooks, who bundled home the ball after being picked out by Duncan Watmore. The ball clearly struck Watmore’s arm before he found Crooks, but after a VAR review, referee Anthony Taylor allowed the goal to stand. Middlesbrough eventually won the match 8-7 on penalties to send Man United out of the FA Cup. Reacting, Lineker branded the handball rule “ridiculous” after Middlesbrough scored a controversial equalizer against Manchester United. In a tweet via his Twitter handle, Lineker wrote: “The right decision given the absurdity of the law. “Clearly accidental but If he’d scored himself it would have been disallowed. The handball law used to be fine. They’ve made it ridiculous.”
