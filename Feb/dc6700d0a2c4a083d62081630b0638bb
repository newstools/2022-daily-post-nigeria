The National Association of Nigerian Students, NANS, on Monday, staged a protest in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, and some other parts of the nation over the lingering strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU. The National President of the association, Sunday Asefon, with other students, converged at Unity Fountain in Abuja on Monday morning, displaying various placards. Students also protested in other states including, Kano State; Jos, Plateau State; Kofar Nasarawa, Minna, Niger State; Jalingo, Taraba State, among others. Asefon, who spoke with newsmen in Abuja at the beginning of the protest, said they were marching from the Unity Fountain to the Federal Secretariat and then proceed to the National Assembly. DAILY POST recalls that NANS, on Tuesday, last week, issued a one-week ultimatum to the Federal Government to resolve its disagreement with ASUU or face a national mass action by Nigerian students across the country. Asefon said the students would block some major roads in the nation’s capital if the government and ASUU fail to resolve the issues within the weekend.
