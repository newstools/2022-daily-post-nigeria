Some top politicians and thousands of their supporters have dumped the All Progressives Congress, APC, for the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Benue State. The defectors who include a two-term House of Assembly Member, Rt Hon Shimawua Azaigba, and their supporters were received into the party on Monday by Governor Samuel Ortom. Speaking at the decamping ceremony at Tse-Agberagba in the Konshisha Local Government Area of the state, the governor expressed hope that the party would reclaim the leadership of Nigeria in the 2023 general elections. The governor, who called on members of the PDP to come together and rebuild the party irrespective of their individual differences, said the only solution to the current security and economic challenges in the country is to ensure that PDP takes over in 2023. Governor Ortom expressed optimism that the PDP will not only retain Benue in the 2023 general elections but also win the three senatorial seats, the 11 House of Representatives positions and all 32 seats for the Benue State House of Assembly. He stated that he remains committed to protecting the interest of the Benue people as his core mandate, pointing out that he will continue to resist the invasion of the Benue land in whatever form.
