Former Ghanaian forward, Mohammed Polo has made an honest confession about the Black Stars’ chance of beating the Super Eagles of Nigeria when both teams clash in a 2022 World Cup qualifier in March. Ghana and Nigeria will clash in a World Cup qualifying playoff on March 23 and 29. But Polo believes the Black Stars will need a miracle to overcome Nigeria for a place at this year’s FIFA World Cup in Qatar, adding that they will have to thank God if they beat the Super Eagles. Ghana suffered their worst ever performance at the just concluded 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, in Cameroon. They crashed out of the 2021 AFCON group stage after losing to debutant Comoros. Ghana Football Association (GFA) later sacked the team’s head coach, Milovan Rajevac, and they are currently searching for a new coach ahead of the Nigeria clash. And Polo, a member of Ghana’s 1978 AFCON winning squad and a former Hearts of Oak attacker, has stated that Black Stars need divine intervention to beat Nigeria. “What is happening will not help us,” Polo told Free FM. “Even if we are able to qualify for the World Cup, it will not help us because this is not the quality. “To be frank, football goes beyond logic. But you need a coach who can put certain things together so that if he is able to win then, he can take us to the World Cup. “But to be frank, the quality of our football today, if we are able to go past Nigeria and go to the World Cup, we shall thank God. But the World Cup is also a different thing,” he stated.
