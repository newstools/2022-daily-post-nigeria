The group managing director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mele Kyari has tendered apologies to Nigerians on the imported adulterated fuel. Mr Kyari issued the apology on Wednesday while appearing before the House of Representatives Committee on downstream. It would be recalled that the NNPC had imported Premium Motor Spirit with excess methanol level above the Nigerian market specification. The House had directed the committee on petroleum resources, downstream to investigate the importation and ordered that marketers who imported the fuel be suspended. During his appearance, Kyari said the importation was unavoidable, he, therefore, apologised to Nigerians for the huge error. “We regret this situation. It is completely unavoidable, we didn’t see it coming. We apologise to Nigerians. We didn’t see this coming,” he said.
