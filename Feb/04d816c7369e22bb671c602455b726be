Former President Goodluck Jonathan said in Lagos State on Monday that recent coups in some African countries posed threats to democracy. Jonathan stated this at a two-day ECOWAS Council of the Wise (CoW) Strategic Retreat and Planning Workshop. Jonathan, Chairperson of COW noted that the commission was determined to restore peace in the troubled countries. “Sub-regions have faced unsavoury developments that have continued to pose a challenge to the peace, security, and sustainable development of West Africa. “Within the last two years, we have witnessed three military coups in Mali, Guinea, and Burkina Faso as well as coup attempts in Niger and Guinea Bissau. “This development poses a serious threat to democracy in ECOWAS, especially at a time that onslaught of militants and terrorists across the Sahel and frontline countries have worsened the security situation in the sub-region. “The ECOWAS Commission and the Authority of Heads of State and governments have been working hard to restore peace and constitutionality in troubled member nations and return ECOWAS to the days of glory,’’ he said.
