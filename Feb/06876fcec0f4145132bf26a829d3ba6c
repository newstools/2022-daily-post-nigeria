Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has said that he will announce the new Olubadan of Ibadan land on Monday. Makinde made this known on Saturday. He spoke at the 40-day funeral reception for the immediate past Olubadan of Ibadan land, Oba Saliu Akanmu Adetunji. Present at the event included Deputy Governor of the state, Engineer Rauf Olaniyan, former Governor of the state, Senator Rasidi Ladoja and Senator representing Oyo South, Dr. Kola Balogun among others. Our correspondent recalls that Oba Adetunji joined his ancestors on Sunday 2nd January 2022. The position of the Olubadan has been vacant since then. Makinde has, however, said he will announce the new Olubadan on Monday after receiving a letter from the Olubadan-in-Council. He said that the Ibadan traditional system is a reference for other towns, villages and cities in the country to emulate due to its democratic nature. “I have received a letter from the Olubadan-in-Council. “By the grace of God, I will announce the new Olubadan of Ibadan land on Monday. “Today that we are organizing the 40-day remembrance of the immediate past Olubadan, we have already known the next king. “Ibadan is not like other towns that will take them more than seven years before they can have a king after the demise of one. “Ibadan traditional system is one that everyone is looking up to emulate.”
