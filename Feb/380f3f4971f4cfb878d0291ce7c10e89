The Delta State Police Command has arrested a teacher of Arise Nursery and Primary School, Asaba, Delta State, for reportedly flogging a 19-month-old child to death. The deceased pupil, simply identified as Obinna, was allegedly given 31 strokes of the cane by the teacher for playing with water and getting wet. The pupil reportedly got into a coma after the punishment from the teacher. Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Bright Edafe, confirming the incident, said the matter is under investigation and the teacher has been arrested. Edafe confirmed that the victim died on Saturday. He said: “We have the suspect who is the son of the owner of the school in our custody. He is a teacher in the school. “But I wonder how a teacher would flog a pupil 31 strokes of the cane. I am only hearing from the media that it was 31 strokes of the cane. “The question is was anybody there to count the strokes while the flogging was on?” Meanwhile, the Delta State Government has shut down the school, disclosing that it was operating without approval. The state Commissioner for Primary Education, Mr Chika Ossai, while sealing up the school, told reporters that the state government will ensure all illegal schools not registered across the state will be closed down. While sympathizing with the family of the minor, the commissioner, through the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, Mr Austin Oghoro, assured that the state government would investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of the child.
