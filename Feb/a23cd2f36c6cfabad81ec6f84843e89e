Michael Owen has slammed Arsenal over their decisions in recent years regarding their best players. The former England striker said he has found it rather difficult to accept those decisions. Most recently, former captain, Pierrre-Emerick Aubameyang fell out with Arteta and was stripped of the captaincy. And the Gabonese was then banished from the first team and finally offloaded to Barcelona in January. Before then, Arsenal sold their highest paid player, Mesut Ozil after the midfielder fell out with Arteta and was being paid his mouth-watering weekly wages even without playing. And former Liverpool striker, Owen admits Arsenal’s handling of contracts and big-name players has made him ‘cringe’. “You look at what they gave Mesut Ozil and never played for ages and ages, then they go and give Aubameyang loads of money again and falls out and gets moved on. “With their big players and big signings, the big renegotiations of contracts, they’ve really messed it up in recent seasons,” he said. Arsenal recorded a 1-0 win over Wolves on Thursday night, courtesy of Gabriel’s first-half strike.
