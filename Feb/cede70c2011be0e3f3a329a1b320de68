The Deputy Governor of Ondo State, Lucky Ayedatiwa, has been accused by voters in the Akure North/South Constituency bye-election that took place on Saturday of distributing money in some polling units during the election. The entrance of the deputy governor at Ward 9, Unit 3, Saint Paul Primary School, Oba-Ile in Akure North Local Area of Ondo, according to some voters, generated tension in the polling unit. Ayedatiwa, who arrived at the voting station in his Mercedes Benz G-Wagon, with a covered number plate, was around for almost 27 minutes before leaving. The appearance of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu’s deputy, who is from the Ilaje Local Government Area, was alleged to have emboldened some thugs, who attempted to seize the ballot boxes, but were resisted by youngsters who insisted that they would not be intimidated. One of the voters, a female who appeared enraged by the situation, stated that no one would be permitted to take any ballot box. Speaking on the allegation, the deputy governor said, “It is not true. How can I go around distributing money? What is my own with that? Anyone that says so should bring evidence where they saw me distributing money. “I live outside government house. I live among the people, so I don’t live in government house for now. So if anybody says they see me, maybe around my area. I don’t understand what they are saying.” However, the immediate past Commissioner for Works in the state and current serving member on the board of SUBEB, Saka Yusuf-Ogunleye confirmed the presence of the deputy governor in the polling unit. “This is not his ward, he is from the south. But as a senior citizen, he came to monitor the situation. How can he be distributing money? He only came here to ask me questions and I told him that the election had been peaceful,” he said.
