Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, is optimistic of having Roberto Firmino and Diogo Jota available for the Carabao Cup final against Chelsea on Sunday. The two forwards missed the 3-1 win against Norwich last weekend with minor injuries. However, their fitness remains doubtful as the Reds look to win their first piece of silverware since the Premier League in 2020. Speaking to the club’s official website, Klopp said that while the two forwards are looking good, it is too early to say whether they’ll be able to participate on Sunday. “Yes, it’s too early. I don’t even know if it will be a late decision or not; like I said, it’s too early. “I saw them both today (Monday), they both look great – but those two always look great. “We have to see how the specific issues develop but we obviously will try everything,” Klopp said.
