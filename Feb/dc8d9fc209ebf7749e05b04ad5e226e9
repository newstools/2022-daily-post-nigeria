Former Sunderland and West Brom striker, Kevin Phillips, has told Liverpool to sign Arsenal’s Bukayo Saka as a possible long-term replacement for Mohamed Salah at Anfield. Salah is currently in contract negotiations with Liverpool and there remains optimism a deal will be agreed before his current deal expires in 2023. However, with one eye on the future, Philips believes Saka could one day be Salah’s successor at Liverpool. He said this ahead of Liverpool’s Premier League tie with Leicester City on Thursday. “I think he will get better and better, Saka. He’s still a young kid, he is done a lot already in his short career,” Phillips told Football Insider. “Whether he can go to Liverpool, if that was to happen, could he emulate what Salah’s done? It would be very, very difficult for any player to do that. “But he certainly has the attributes and qualities that he possibly could join Liverpool and replace Salah. Let’s not forget, Salah didn’t tear it up early on at Chelsea. “For Saka, he is developing all the time.”
