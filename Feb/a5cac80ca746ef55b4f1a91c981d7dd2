The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has approved use of the MKO Abiola National Stadium in Abuja, for next month’s 2022 World Cup playoff between Nigeria and Ghana. The match will be played March 29. This approval was contained in a memo dated February 3, 2022 and addressed to the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) General Secretary and signed by CAF development director, Raul Chipenda. However, CAF has ordered that the pitch, floodlights and dressing room at the MKO Abiola stadium be brought up to the required standards before their second inspection visit. The Super Eagles played their home fixtures during the initial rounds of the World Cup qualifiers at the Teslim Balogun Stadium in Lagos.
