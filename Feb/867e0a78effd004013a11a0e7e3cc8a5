Senator Ademola Adeleke, a top aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Osun 2022 gubernatorial election, has denied that he walked out of the party’s peace and reconciliation meeting on Monday. DAILY POST had reported that Adeleke stormed out of the peace and reconciliation meeting convened by a former governor of the state, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola because he was not comfortable with the direction of the meeting. But Adeleke in a statement by his campaign organisation, noted that he accepted the resolutions made at the meeting but only left the meeting to attend to an urgent family matter. He further stated that the meeting was fruitful with commendable resolutions and conclusions. “I commend our leaders for the successful outcomes of the meeting. I associate myself with the resolutions reached. “PDP is now one big united family in Osun State. I accepted the resolutions reached, though I left afterwards to attend to urgent family matters. “We urge PDP members to sustain the peace efforts and avoid spreading rumours that may derail the successful conclusion of the ongoing reconciliation moves,” he added.
