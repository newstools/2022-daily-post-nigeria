A presidential aspirant for the 2023 election, Prince Adewole Adebayo has cried out to the government and all stakeholders not to allow another elongated strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU. Adewale is calling on the Buhari administration to, as quickly as possible, resolve its differences with the lecturers’ body. According to the presidential aspirant, a similar situation made him stay in the university three years longer in the 90s and up till now, strike was still being talked about in the country. He said that the government and all stakeholders must understand that industrial harmony impacts on the students and their family, adding that education was the cornerstone of civilization and the future of the country depends on it. In a video he circulated on social media, Adebayo said, “Why do we keep having these recurrent problems? Why do some problems look like they want to be permanent with us. I can recall how I lost three years in the University in the 90s. Due to this same industrial dispute. “None of the problems that the Academic Staff Union and the Universities have with the federal government seems to be going away. “Is it university autonomy, is it funding, is it curriculum development, is it the payment verification system, just anything could trigger yet another strike. “There is no integrity in the academic calendar of the universities all over again. “Many lose opportunities of employment after school; I call on ASUU and the universities and governments to put an end to this. “I know what guys want, their wages. And you cannot fault ASUU for going on strike when there is a dispute.” Adebayo, however, called on the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu and that of Labour, Dr. Chris Ngige, to find a lasting solution to the menace and to understand the fact that the future of these young people was at stake. “I will be monitoring the situation, I will be talking to the parties and I will be briefing you,” he added.
