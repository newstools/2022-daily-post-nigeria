Manchester United forward, Marcus Rashford, on Wednesday evening, dismissed claims of a split within the Red Devils squad over Cristiano Ronaldo’s role in the club’s dressing room. Man United have struggled for consistency so far this season since Ronaldo rejoined the club from Juventus last summer. Reports had emerged this week that Ronaldo is reportedly unsatisfied with his role at Man United’s dressing room and has attempted to impose himself further upon the club’s leadership, angering Rashford and captain Harry Maguire. But Rashford has now rubbished the report, insisting that pundits are “looking for divides” to pick over amid Man United’s current form. Responding to a post on Twitter by SportBild journalist Christian Falk claiming that English players like Maguire, Rashford and co at Man United are “irritated” with Ronaldo’s moves within the changing room, Rashford sought to shut down such claims. The England international tweeted: “Are we just making it up as we go along now then?,” the forward replied, retweeting the original missive. “Please stop looking for divides,” the 24-year-old further added. This is coming less than 24 hours after Man United defeated Brighton 2-0 in a Premier League tie on Tuesday night at Old Trafford, thanks to goals from Ronaldo and Bruno Fernandes.
