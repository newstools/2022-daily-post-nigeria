Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp has claimed they cannot catch Manchester City despite their 2-0 win over Leicester City, on Thursday. The German feels his team does not have the Premier League champions “on their knees yet” in the title race. Diogo Jota scored twice in either half at Anfield, as the Reds went within nine points of City, with a game in hand. But Klopp does not think the gap is enough to trouble the reigning champions. He said: “I am not sure we’re in a position to get them on their toes, to be honest. “Actually, we have no chance to catch them, but it doesn’t mean we won’t play the best possible season for us. “First and foremost, we have to win our football games and this club is massive. Since I’m here, I can’t remember a game we lost and everyone said ‘yeah, we can lose that game’, so it’s always the same situation. “There’s a game, we put on the shirts and we have to win it. It doesn’t work out all the time, but thankfully it’s happened a couple of times. “It was really important tonight for us to win because there’s not only Man City to catch or whatever, there are lots of teams behind us who want to get closer and that’s a very important task as well. “I don’t think they smell our breath already, but we just try to win football games.”
