The management of the Yobe State Road Traffic Agency (YOROTA) has warned residents of Damaturu, the state capital, against boarding unregistered taxis at night. The state road regulatory agency, in a statement posted on its verified Facebook page on Saturday, gave the warning following a report received by its operatives on a suspected criminal operating taxi service at night to rob unsuspecting members of the public. The agency posted, “Report just reached us of a suspected criminal operating taxi service this night”. YOROTA gave the description of the vehicle that the suspect is using to rob his passengers. “Model: Honda (Panadol) One Door; Color: Ash; Glass: Tinted with No Plate Number,” it said. The agency then warned the general public to desist from boarding any taxi without approved government specifications. “However, YOROTA Marshalls hare been deployed to strategic places to apprehend the suspect”, it posted.
