The President, Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU), Mr Jonathan Asake, has cried out following incessant attacks on villages in the area, adding that about 108 communities have been completely brought down by suspected Fulani militias. He added that at the moment, there are about 70,000 displaced persons living in unofficial camps in the area with no government assistance, saying that the figure represents only 20 percent of those living with neighbouring communities. Asake lamented that Southern Kaduna is facing a serious humanitarian crisis where people are killed, houses razed, while farmlands are completely destroyed by suspected Fulani militias leaving the locals with nothing to earn a living. He called on the government, individuals, groups, organisations, faith-based and circular and the international community to please come to the aid of the distressed people to give them hope for the future. The SOKAPU President noted that with the security challenges the people are faced with, business activities have come to a halt, adding that farming and harvesting have become impossible due to the presence of terrorists who have taken over the place.
