Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Friday described former Head of the Interim National Government, Ernest Shonekan, as a man of destiny. The VP eulogized the deceased during the State Funeral Service at the Cathedral Church of Christ in Marina, Lagos. Osinbajo said Shonekan lived his life motivated by a burden of duty, as a citizen of considerable privilege, to give back. The VP noted that no one could have written the script of occurrences that thrust upon him the role of the Head of State and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces. He called it a testament to that sense of duty that even while out of office, Shonekan remained deeply vested in the fate of his country. Osinbajo praised the former leader for supporting all governments and serving the nation in this role “far above the trenches”. “We stand in the light of this great man. The inevitable transition of the people we love, sad as it is, gives us a sombre opportunity to celebrate the lives they led. “His accomplishments as a businessman, political figure, and bridge builder are already the stuff of legend and will be talked about for generations”, the VP said.
