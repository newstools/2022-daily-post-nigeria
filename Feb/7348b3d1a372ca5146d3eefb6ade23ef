Arsenal will hand manager, Mikel Arteta a £180million transfer warchest next summer, in what would be a record window for the club, according to the UK Sun. It would be another show of faith in Arteta by majority owner, Stan Kroenke. Kroenke is keen to inject funds into the Gunners’ squad to continue the overhaul. Strikers Alexander Isak (Real Sociedad), Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Everton) and midfielder Ruben Neves (Wolves) have all been lined up as potential future targets. Isak has a release clause of £75m, while Calvert-Lewin is valued at £60million. To tempt Neves away from Wolves, Arsenal would also have to stump up another £45m. Arteta views the targets as young, driven players with quality to take them “to the next level”. Last summer, Arteta splashed £150m on Ben White, Martin Odegaard, Aaron Ramsdale, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Albert Sambi Lokonga and Nuno Tavares. The new recruits have mostly hit the ground running at the Emirates. Arteta is under pressure to guide the team back into the Champions League and securing a spot in the competition may well prove make or break in their attempts to bring in their three key targets, too. Recruiting a new forward is unsurprisingly a priority for the head coach, after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang departed the capital to sign for Barcelona. The former Borussia Dortmund man was allowed to leave on a free transfer. His exit, though, is expected to save Arsenal roughly £20million.
