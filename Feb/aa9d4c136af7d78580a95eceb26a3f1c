Arsenal forward, Gabriel Martinelli, is looking set to take over Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s role in the team. He might even inherit the iconic no.14 shirt from Aubameyang, according to Football London. Martinelli speaking last February to ESPN Brazil, said: “Of course, Auba is an incredible player. Not just a player, an incredible person. “I’d like to follow in his footsteps, he’s captain of the team, wearing shirt 14, which is a symbol of the club. I hope to have a bright future ahead at Arsenal.” Martinelli currently wears the no.35 shirt for the Gunners. Arsenal handed midfielder Emile Smith Rowe the No.10 shirt last summer, despite the weight of expectation following the magic of Dennis Bergkamp and Mesut Ozil. Having played mostly on the left-wing, it appears the Brazilian youngster could now be thrust into the role of central striker on a more frequent basis. Arteta has already been working on fitting Martinelli to that mould, with Arsenal’s Dubai training camp seeing the youngster operating through the middle as well as on either flank.
