Former Manchester United stars, Owen Hargreaves and Rio Ferdinand, have named the strongest teams in the Champions League this season. Both former England stars believe that Manchester City are the favourites to win the 2021/22 Champions League trophy. However, Ferdinand sees Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool as a team to beat, also describing them as a very strong side heading into the round of 16 matches. “I believe Manchester City and Liverpool are the two strongest teams in the competition this season,” Ferdinand said on BT Sport. “The players they’ve got…they’ve been together for a long while now and came close to winning last season… Hargreaves added, “Liverpool are the favourites. Yeah, I’ll say Manchester City and Liverpool, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain.” Manchester City are up against Sporting Lisbon at Etihad in the first leg of the round of sixteen clash on Tuesday night.
