Mikel Arteta has hit back at Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang after the player suggested he was his ‘only problem’ at Arsenal. Arteta in his response insisted that he was the ‘solution’ to the striker’s troubles. After his free transfer to Barcelona during the winter window, Aubameyang had claimed that Arteta was his only problem at the Emirates Stadium. Arteta stripped Aubameyang of the club captaincy in December and later banished him from the first over alleged disciplinary breach. “Well Auba’s trajectory at the club and importance of his goals is unquestionable,” Arteta told the press. “But we have other players and we believe we have other qualities to try to accomplish the goals we need in the team and that’s what we’ll try to do. “I am extremely grateful for what Auba did at the club, for his contributions since I was here and the way I see myself in that relationship is the solution, not the problem.”
