Blessing John, an 18-year-old girl, has been apprehended by the police in Adamawa State while searching for a ritualist to buy a boy she allegedly kidnapped. She was alleged to have lured the boy from Michika, her neighbourhood, and took him to Mubi in search of a buyer. DSP Sulaiman Nguroje, the Police Public Relations Officer in the State, explained that Blessing John was arrested as a result of a tip-off. According to Nguroje, Blessing John told the police investigators that she wanted to raise money to buy a car and live a luxurious life, hence, she had to abduct the boy. According to the PPRO, “she took the little boy to Mubi to sell, but when she could not reach the buyers on phone, she decided to search for another buyer. She ended up talking to the wrong person, who in turn informed the police.” Nguroje further explained that a friend told her she could make money by supplying children to ritualists and human traffickers. The PPRO advised parents to ensure vigilance and look after their children carefully, stressing that they should not hesitate to report suspicious persons to the nearest police authority or any security agent.
