Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Thursday said the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) remains opposed to military takeovers. The VP insisted the only way of changing government, acceptable to all protocols and political rights of the people, are elections. He spoke after attending the ECOWAS Extraordinary Summit on the political situations in Burkina Faso, Mali and Guinea in Accra, Ghana. Osinbajo, who represented President Muhammadu Buhari, confirmed deliberation has been fruitful. He said leaders reiterated their position that there is absolutely no excuse for a change of government by coup d’etat. “What happened in Burkina Faso was considered and has been condemned by all Heads of State. Engagement is going on with the military junta. “We condemned the attempted coup in Guinea-Bissau and congratulated President Embalo and the people for resisting that unconstitutional attempt.” Osinbajo expressed hope that lessons have been learnt as the regional bloc would not like to see a repeat of mutiny. On Mali, he told reporters that ECOWAS awaits the authorities to respond to imposed sanctions. “We expect that at some point, the Malian authorities themselves would begin to speed up the process of transition.” The VP, who was accompanied to Ghana by Nigerian diplomats, is back to Abuja.
