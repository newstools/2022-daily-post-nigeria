Al Hilal striker, Odion Ighalo, has confirmed he is ready to play for Nigeria against Ghana in the 2022 World Cup playoffs next month. This was revealed by Amaju Pinnick, the president of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). Ighalo was included in the Super Eagles’ 2021 Africa Cup of Nations squad after coming out of retirement. However, the 32-year-old could not honour the callup because of club issues. However, Pinnick has now confirmed that Ighalo will be back for the two crunch games against the Black Stars next month. The NFF president said this after visiting Ighalo in Qatar, where he is currently representing his new club Al-Hilal at the FIFA Club World Cup. Pinnick tweeted: “I just met with @ighalojude, the highest goalscorer at the 2019 edition of the AFCON, now playing and still scoring goals for Saudi Arabia’s biggest football club. Odion has assured that playing for his country will always come first and he is ready to ensure that we do play at this year’s @FIFAWorldCup in Qatar. Ighalo had initially retired from national duty in 2019, but he came out of retirement after speaking to Pinnick and ex-Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr.
