Suspected Fulani militias, Friday night, attacked Ma Kura village in Atyap Chiefdom, Zangon Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State, killing about two persons, leaving several others injured. A source told DAILY POST that the gunmen came in their large numbers, moving from house to house to unleash attacks on residents. According to the source, “The attackers came while people were asleep, but the villagers were able to organize themselves against the invaders and that reduced the casualty figure.” He could not precisely give the exact number of those injured during the attack but explained that the injured ones have been rushed to an undisclosed hospital for treatment. He further explained that some houses, including foodstuffs and other valuables were also burnt down completely during the attack. The source stated further that security personnel came to the village to see for themselves the destruction made and as well ensure normalcy returns to the community. When contacted to confirm the incident, the State Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige, did not respond to the phone calls put across to him up to the time of filing this report.
