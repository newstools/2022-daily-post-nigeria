President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday received the Ambassador of Senegal in a farewell audience at the State House, Abuja, asking him to convey the congratulations of Nigeria to President Macky Sall on the victory of the Teranga Lions at the just concluded 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cameroon. Recall that Senegal won the 2021 AFCON last Sunday after beating Egypt 4-2 on penalties. Liverpool’s Sadio Mane scored the winning penalty for Senegal against Egypt to give his side their maiden AFCON trophy. “I’m sending the congratulations reluctantly because our own country got beaten in the tournament,” the President jocularly told His Excellency, Babacar Matar Ndiaye. Buhari’s spokesman, Mr Femi Adesina, disclosed this in a statement on Thursday. Buhari lauded him for a successful tour of duty in Nigeria, which lasted almost four years, and observed that “our relationship is very strong. I congratulate your President for keeping the country together. Please extend my best wishes to him.” He also wished the outgoing Ambassador success in his next tour of duty. Meanwhile, Ambassador Ndiaye said Nigeria was like a second home to him. Ndiaye, who had served in the consular section of his Embassy before returning as an Ambassador for almost four years, said: “Thanks for the success of my term. I’ll always have good memories of Nigeria.”
