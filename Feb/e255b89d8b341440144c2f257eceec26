Manchester United goalkeeper, David de Gea, has made an honest confession following his side’s Premier League 2-0 win over Brighton on Tuesday night. Man United defeated Brighton at Old Trafford, thanks to two goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and Bruno Fernandes. But De Gea believes the first half of the encounter was not the best for Ralf Rangnick’s men, adding that Brighton had a couple of chances against Man United. Speaking to MUTV afterwards, De Gea said: “Well, to be honest, I think we had control of the game in the second half. The first half wasn’t the best, they had a couple of good chances. “But then we reacted very well in the second half, we scored a goal, we get the red card for them. “Even like this, we give a couple of chances at the end so we should kill the game before but at the moment, the three points are the most important thing so we are happy with the three points.” He added: “As I say, we should have scored much earlier, we had a couple of good chances and then you suffer when you don’t score the goal and you don’t kill the game. “You suffer because they are a good team, they know how to play, but this is football, we win the game and we’re happy.”
