Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has revealed Mason Mount could be out of action for a while. Mount suffered a nasty-looking ankle ligament injury during their 2-1 win over Palmeiras in the Club World Cup final. The England midfielder was taken off after just half an hour in Abu Dhabi. “Mason was injured, in one of the very first scenes where he made a run to the far post with (Cesar) Azpilicueta, they both fell and his opponent fell on his ankle. “And he hurt his ligaments badly, so we have to see. “He came straight to me and said he does not feel good, it felt painful and he did not know if he could continue. So we had to make the decision,” Tuchel said. The Blues are away to Crystal Palace in the Premier League in their next fixture.
