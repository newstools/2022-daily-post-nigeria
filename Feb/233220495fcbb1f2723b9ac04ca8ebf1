Stakeholders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) from the Bauchi Central senatorial zone have raised concerns that the national reconciliation committee set up by the national headquarters of the party is yet to visit the state to mediate among aggrieved party members. This was disclosed on Wednesday by the chairman, Bauchi Central APC Stakeholders, Adamu Noma during a press conference. The APC committee, headed by a former Nasarawa State Governor, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, was set up by the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led caretaker committee of the party to look into complaints emanating from the congresses held last October in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. Noma said following the emergence of two different chairmen, Sunusi Aliyu Kunde and Babayo Aliyu respectively in Bauchi State the stakeholders wrote to the reconciliation committee but has yet to receive a response on the lingering leadership crisis in the state. He said the factional chairmen, emerged through various congresses held by party members. He added that despite the petition, the Senator Adamu-led committee has not visited the state to reconcile party members, a development he said was not good for the party. DAILY POST reports that the crisis in the party in Bauchi State came to a head when on the 8th of December, 2021, the Bauchi State High Court issued an order of interim injunction stopping the Buni-led caretaker committee from inaugurating the Babayo Aliyu-led new state executives of the party. The court further ordered Aliyu to stop parading himself as the APC chairman in the state.
