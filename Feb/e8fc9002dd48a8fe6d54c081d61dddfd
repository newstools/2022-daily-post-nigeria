The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isah Ali Ibrahim Pantami has added the rank of ‘Professor’ to his name in some changes made to his personal Facebook page. The addition of the new title is coming amidst widespread criticism against the professorship, which was conferred on him by the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, (FUTO). Recall that the national body of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) recently declared Pantami’s Professorship as ‘illegal’ and vowed to sanction the management of the FUTO for breaching due process. DAILY POST also learnt that the management of FUTO had gone to court over the rejection of Pantami’s promotion to the rank of professor of Cyber Security by the institution. Millions of Nigerians are keenly waiting to see who wins the battle in court between FUTO and ASUU.
