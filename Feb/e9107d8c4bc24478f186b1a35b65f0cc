Super Eagles coaches, Austine Eguavoen and Emmanuel Amuneke have reportedly departed for England as Nigeria prepares for their World Cup playoff against Ghana. Eguavoen was reportedly seen alongside Amuneke as they made their way to England where they are expected to hold talks with some players of the senior national team of Nigeria. The coaches will talk to the England-based players on issues bothering on match bonuses and also try to convince the Crystal Palace duo of Michael Olise and Ebere Eze on switching allegiance to Nigeria, according to OwnGoal. The football site quoted a top official of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) as saying that contacts have been established with Olise and Eze and if all goes according to plan they will meet with the coach. “It’s on the menu and contacts have been made already. Ademola Lookman is secured but the duo of Eze and Olise need to hear from the coach what his plans are for them,” the source reportedly said. “Southampton’s Nathan Tella and Ovie Ejaria of Reading will also if possible meet with the coach”, he told OwnGoalNigeria. He said the move is geared towards getting the best readily available players to represent Nigeria.
