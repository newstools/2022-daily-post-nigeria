The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Osun State Command, has condemned the attack by hoodlums on Oranmiyan House, the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola’s campaign office located in Osogbo, Osun State capital. DAILY POST reported that thugs, about five in number, were allegedly shooting directly into the four-storey building. The incident, according to eyewitnesses, happened around 5:20 pm on Thursday. The command, however, said it has deployed its operatives to protect the critical infrastructure and the people until calm is restored in the environment. The Commandant, Osun State Command, Emmanuel Ocheja, made the statement while visiting the facilities on Thursday. Ocheja, in a statement made available to DAILY POST by the command’s spokesperson, ASCII Olabisi Atanda, sounded a note of warning to the miscreants with advice to consider relocating out of the state as such untoward criminal act will not be tolerated henceforth in the state. Meanwhile, Commandant Ocheja said, “the Corps is working in synergy, with other security agencies to ensure a peaceful atmosphere and he emphasized that no one that is caught acting against the law will be spared.” The Osun State Government had condemned the incidents and charged the Commissioner of Police to fish out the perpetrators of the attack on the Oranmiyan House campaign office.
