Shina Peller, a member of the House of Representatives, has sponsored a bill to repeal the National Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC). The bill is proposing that the Nigeria Police Force absorb all officers of the NSCDC. In the bill, which was introduced on Tuesday, Peller said the agency is gulping N100 billion annually despite doing the exact functions of the police. He described the situation as a waste of resources. In the interim, the bill proposes the creation of a transition committee that will ensure easy transfer to the police. He added that the bill will not lead to job loss because all officers of the NSCDC will be absorbed into the police. “The mandate of the NSCDC has expanded that it has now become a duplication of the Nigeria Police Force. This has led to avoidable conflicts,” he stated
