Why our government just dey deny us all the good things for this life? Make we try to get sense for 2023 general election. “Get your PVC guys. Any silly mistake, it’s going to be a long eight years of wahala. Enough of all this recycling Government! We no do again! Get sense for the 2023 election. “Abeg who we offend for our country Nigeria? Abi our Government no de see all this beautiful things? Na even dem travel pass but them no fit imitate!
