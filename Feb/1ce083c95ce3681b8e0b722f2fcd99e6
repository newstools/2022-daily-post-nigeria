Napoli striker, Victor Osimhen, was not on the score sheet as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Barcelona in the Europa League on Thursday. Osimhen played for 80 minutes at the Camp Nou, but was unable to find the back of the net. It was Piotr Zielinski who gave the Serie A side the lead in the first half. However, Ferran Torres equalized from the penalty spot on the hour mark. Barca could have taken charge of the round of 32 tie, but failed to convert a couple of chances in the second half, with Torres especially guilty. The second leg will be played in Naples on February 24.
