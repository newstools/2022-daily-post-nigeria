The Rapid Response Squad (RRS) of the Lagos State Police Command made a major intervention on Thursday. Operatives on routine patrol of the 3rd Mainland Bridge stopped a lady from committing suicide. She was about to jump into the lagoon outward Iyana Oworo axis when officers restrained her. “I was beaten at home, that is why I ran away to commit suicide,” the citizen explained. The RRS disclosed that the attention of officers was drawn by a dispatch rider. “She has been conveyed to Iyana Oworo police division, where efforts are in progress to contact family members,” the unit said.
