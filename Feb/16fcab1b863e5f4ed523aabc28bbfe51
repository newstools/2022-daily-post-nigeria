Ganduje’s faction of the All Progressives Congress APC in Kano State had threatened to arrest the factional leader of the Ibrahim Shekarau faction, Ahmadu Haruna Zago if he ever parades himself as the state chairman of the party. Party Publicity Secretary Ahmad S. Aruwan disclosed this in an interview with newsmen. This is coming hours after the G-7 faction of the party led by Shekarau kicked against the decision of the Abuja court of appeal which handed the control of the APC in Kano to Governor Abdullahi Ganduje. DAILY POST reported that the Court of Appeal in Abuja set aside the judgment of the FCT High Court which invalidated the ward and local government congresses of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kano State. The National APC headquarters had on Friday issued certificates of return to the Ganduje factional APC Chairman, Abdullahi Abbas. The Factional chairman Ahmad Haruna Zago had on Saturday claimed to be the substantive chairman of the party and also kicked against the court of appeal judgment, vowing to proceed to the Supreme Court. Mr. Aruwan said Danzago has no reason to parade himself as the party’s chairman after the court of appeal judgment, saying the party will take action against him if he ever presents himself as the state APC chairman.
