An All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential aspirant, Rochas Okorocha has suggested why members of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, became terrorists. Okorocha explained that IPOB became a terrorist group because it was not properly handled by the government. The former governor of Imo State spoke while addressing State House Correspondents after his meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday. Okorocha said he, however, sees IPOB members as poorly educated children and not terrorists. According to Okorocha: “There was no need to have handled the IPOB matter the way it was handled. Today they have turned out to be terrorists. “But for me, I don’t see them as terrorists. I see them as children who have not been properly educated on the happenings.” Members of IPOB have been agitating for the actualization of Biafra in the Southeast. Their agitation led to the arrest of the group’s leader, Nnamdi Kanu. Kanu is facing terrorism charges before an Abuja Federal High Court. The charges were brought against him by the Nigerian Government.
