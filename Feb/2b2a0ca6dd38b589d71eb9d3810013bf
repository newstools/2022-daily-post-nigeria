Asari Dokubo, a former Niger Delta leader, has disclosed why he believes Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, can never regain freedom. Dokubo said Kanu would not be released from the Department of State Services’ dungeon due to the evil he committed. The defunct Niger Delta Peoples Salvation Force leader disclosed this in a recent video on his Facebook wall. He alleged that the evil Kanu committed can not be corrected; hence he would not come out of the DSS dungeon. Dokubo also blamed the alleged cannibalism, kidnapping, drug abuses in the Southeast on Kanu, IPOB and the Eastern Security Network (ESN). Dokubo said, “I don’t think God will help Nnamdi Kanu to come out from that dungeon (referring to DSS). He will not come out, for the evil he has committed cannot be corrected.” “Stop blaming others for what you have done. “Your DOS has admitted, your autopilot has admitted, Simon Ekpa has admitted, they’ve all admitted. Stop blaming others. That is the truth. The cannibals at Orsumoghu, Anambra State; and Orsuihiteukwa in Orlu, Imo State, the kidnappers, the armed robbers, the rapists, all of them, they are associated with IPOB and ESN. This is the truth, confirmed by the mouth of your own leadership.” Watch video here….
