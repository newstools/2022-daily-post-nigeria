Former President of the Senate, Anyim Pius Anyim, has reacted to the killing of about eight northern cattle dealers and slaughtering of several cows in Abia State. Recall that hoodlums on Tuesday night, February 16, 2022, attacked the new Abia cattle market in Omuma Uzo, Ukwa West council area, killed traders, mostly northerners and slaughtered their cows.

Nigeria must be great again,” he said. Anyim, who called for a minute of silence in honour of the victims, described the killing as “dastardly and condemnable”, urging all Nigerians to live in peace with one another. “We must live in peace and in safety in this land. It is a commitment that all of us irrespective of your religion, irrespective of your geographical location, irrespective of your party affiliation. “We must commit to building a peaceful and secure nation which we shall be proud of,” he said. DAILY POST reports that dignitaries including President Muhammadu Buhari and former President Goodluck Jonathan attended the event which drew Nigerians from all walks of life. In his speech, Buhari, represented by Mr Boss Mustapha, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), lauded Anyim’s contributions to the development of the country, describing him as a patriotic Nigerian who always puts the nation first and a stabilising voice in Nigeria.
