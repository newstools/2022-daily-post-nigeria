The Lagos State Government has banned the use of all forms of amplifiers at motor parks across the state. Special Adviser on Transportation, Oluwatoyin Fayinka, made the announcement at a Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency (LASEPA) briefing. Fayinka lamented the indiscriminate use of megaphones and speakers to attract passengers. From now, anybody caught using any noise-generating device would be sanctioned in accordance with the law. The official said the Park Monitoring Committee has been mandated to monitor parks for total compliance and restore sanity. Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Water Resources (OES), Tajudeen Gaji, lamented that noise pollution was in excess of permissible limits. Gaji said apart from the transport sector, religious, commercial and entertainment industries were also culpable. “Adults show great concerns from problems associated with noise pollution, but children are quite vulnerable as there are no known visible symptoms at early age,” he noted.
