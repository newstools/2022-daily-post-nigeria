Manchester United legend, Paul Scholes, has hailed Ademola Lookman as the most dangerous player for Leicester City in their 2-1 defeat to Wolves on Sunday. Ademola put up a spectacular performance for Brendan Rodgers’ Foxes but could not prevent them from falling in the hands of Wolves. The Nigeria international, who is on loan from RB Leipzig, was in the starting lineup again on Sunday. He scored four minutes before halftime to cancel out Rúben Neves’ early opener. Lookman was a nightmare to Wolves defence, especially in the first half and had more touches in the opposition box, than any other player. Analysing the game on Premier League, Manchester United legend, hailed the former England youth team player who recently switched allegiance to Nigeria. “Really good play from Tielemans, we know the quality he has and he showed it with the weighted pass,” the former midfielder said. “Lookman coming in from the other side, Albrighton squares it. Lookman has been a real threat, he’s been Leicester’s most dangerous player and he’s alert, he comes inside and he gets his goal,” he said.
