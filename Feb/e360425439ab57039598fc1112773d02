Middlesbrough, on Friday, scored a controversial equalizer against Manchester United in the FA Cup fourth round. Although United’s interim coach, Ralf Rangnick did not approve of the goal, it was passed by the referees according to Premier League rules. United had taken the lead through Jadon Sancho in the first half. However, the visitors made it 1-1 through Matt Crooks, who bundled home the ball after being picked out by Duncan Watmore. The ball clearly struck Watmore’s arm before he found Crooks, but after a VAR review, referee Anthony Taylor allowed the goal to stand. The goal was allowed to stand due to revisions made to the handball law by the International Football Association Board (IFAB) this season. “If an attacking player’s accidental handball immediately precedes another player scoring, the goal will now be awarded when last season it was likely to have been ruled out,” details on the Premier League’s website explain.
