The Taraba State Commandant of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Edwin Ugwuji, has warned marketers hoarding petroleum products to desist from doing so or face the wrath of the law. He gave the directive on Saturday in Jalingo, during an interactive session with our correspondent, expressing the command’s readiness to seal any filling station caught hoarding the product. DAILY POST observed long queues have returned to parts of the state, with customers alleging that marketers were hoarding the product. While directing for the immediate opening and dispensing of the product to avert panic buying as well as artificial scarcity, the command, as stated by him, would no longer sit back watching such marketers making life difficult for the people. Vowing not to leave any stone unturned in bringing such marketers to book, he said “If they have fuel in their tanks, they must sell”. “If there is any marketer that has gone contrary to the stipulated regulation, we will seal the filling station, after which we can take the matter to court,” he said. He assured the people of the state of the command’s readiness to ensure the availability of fuel, hence the need for them to desist from embarking on panic buying. Motorists spread across the state had earlier decried the ill attitude of marketers, whom they accused of hoarding the product despite its availability.
