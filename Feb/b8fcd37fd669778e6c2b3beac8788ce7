Gunmen on Monday killed two policemen and kidnapped a couple in Anambra State. The couple, whose names were given as Mr Ceejay and Dr Nini, were said to have been kidnapped in Okija, Ihiala Local Government Area of the state. A source said the couple were headed to Owerri Airport, Imo State, before the incident happened. The Anambra State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Ikenganyia Tochukwu, said he was yet to receive such information. However, a senior police officer, who did not want to be mentioned because he is not authorised to speak, said the kidnapped couple were later released on Monday night. He added that the couple were dropped off by the hoodlums at Ukpor, Nnewi South Local Government Area of the state.
