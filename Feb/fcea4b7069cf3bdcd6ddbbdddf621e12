Oyo State Government, on Thursday, said that it has sealed a hotel, an event center and no fewer than 80 shops. The edifices, according to the government, were sealed over violation of environmental laws in the state. Commissioner for Environment and Natural Resources, Mr. Abiodun Oni made these disclosures on Thursday. He told journalists that the decisions were taken on Thursday. Oni, who led other staff in the ministry, reiterated that the need to seal up these facilities became necessary so as to put an end to environmental nuisance in the state. He added that all the facilities were sealed in Ibadan, the state capital on Thursday. He said that one of the edifices that were sealed included the Premier Hotel and an Event Centre, located at Eleyele area of Ibadan. Oni explained further that the hotel was sealed because it failed to co-operate with the government. He said that a 7-day ultimatum was given to the hotel to comply. The commissioner noted that occupants of the shops were found for indiscriminate dumping of wastes on the road median and accommodating a filthy drainage at the frontage of their shops. He stressed that as citizens, proper waste disposal is a way of exercising their responsibilities. Oni, who spoke after the exercise was carried out said, “It is disheartening that despite efforts of this administration to provide an enabling and sustainable environment to residents, people still go ahead violating the environmental laws of the state whereas a filthy environment poses threats to individual’s lives in the state. When sickness comes, it knows no boundaries”.
