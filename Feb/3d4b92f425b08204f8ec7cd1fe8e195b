Ahead of the 2023 Presidential election, President Muhammadu Buhari, has said former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, SGF, Anyim Pius Anyim has what it takes to occupy any political office. Buhari made the remark while describing Anyim as one of those who can stabilize Nigeria politically. He spoke at an event to mark Anyim’s 61st birthday in Abuja yesterday. Represented by the SGF, Boss Mustapha, the President said Anyim is a patriotic Nigerian. He said: “Anyim is one of stabilising voices we have today in the politics of our country. “Let me say on a personal note, as the current and 19th SGF that I have drawn a lot from the wealth of wisdom that has been the source of strength and the endowment that Senator Anyim has brought to the fore of governance in this country. “We don’t often meet but whenever we meet, we share knowledge about the responsibilities of the office and the enormity of the act of balancing contending forces and interests, that is always vested on any occupant of that office. “I made bold to say whoever had occupied the Office of the Secretary to the Government for four years in an evolving democracy like Nigeria, with diverse contentious issues, is capable and able to occupy any office.” The former Senate President is one of those who had declared their interest to run for the Presidency in 2023.
