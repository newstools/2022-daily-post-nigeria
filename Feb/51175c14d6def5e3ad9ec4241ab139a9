The new chairman of People’s Redemption Party, PRP, in Kogi State, Alhaji Yakubu Mohammed, has reiterated the determination of his party to take over the reins of government; both in the state and at the national level in the forthcoming general elections in the country. Mohammed made this known to journalists on Saturday, shortly after the conduct of the state congress of the party. Mohammed, who asked the ruling APC to pack their languages and leave Lugard House, disclosed that the People’s Redemption Party is a socialist ideology party, which is aimed at the emancipation of the masses. He noted that all the party needed was to wrestle power from the ruling APC, adding they will sensitize and raise the people’s consciousness on their rights and electoral power of making a difference in their socioeconomic status through the ballot box. He explained that all that is required of them as a party is to make adequate information available to the people to make a proper and good choice of candidates. The party chairman, who decried the pains that APC has brought upon its citizens, stated that money politics would not be able to get the people’s votes in the coming polls. He urged the occupant of Lugard House, Lokoja, to be ready to pack his loads as the APC has succeeded in inflicting so much pains on the people.
