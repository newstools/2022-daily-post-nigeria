Malam Yahaya Sarki, the Special Adviser to Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State says that the State government was not aware that the abducted schoolgirls of the Federal Government College Birnin Yauri, in Kebbi State, have been forcefully married to bandits. Report has it that the thirteen schoolgirls have been forcefully married to bandits who abducted them eight months ago. According to the Special Adviser to Governor, the State government was not aware of the sad development. It was reported that the girls were forcefully married to the bandits early last week as the negotiation between Kebbi State Government and the bandits on how to rescue them did not yield positive results. Mr Odidika Solomon, one of the parents of the girls, confirmed that, “I really heard that the bandits have forcefully married our daughters but I cannot confirm this, although my daughter is still in captivity.” According to the Special Adviser, “We are not aware of the marriage but I read the story on Daily Trust online and I also heard the news from BBC Hausa in the evening of today Monday.” DAILY POST reported that the terrorists in August last year abducted over 80 students and the Vice Principal at the Federal Government College Birnin Yauri in Kebbi State. All the abducted students were released, except 13 girls and a boy.
