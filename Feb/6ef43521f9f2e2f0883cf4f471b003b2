The newly-deployed Commissioner of Police in Yobe State, Haruna Garba, has tasked residents of the state, as a matter of civic responsibility, key into community policing initiative in the ongoing efforts to rid the state of crime. The CP made the appeal in a maiden parley with newsmen in Damaturu at the Police Command’s Headquarters on Wednesday. “The job of policing a state as you are aware requires public partnership and collaboration. “Members of the community can no longer remain and watch criminal elements take over their communities. There is this adage that says ‘When you see something, say something’; if you see a crime being committed or about to be committed, you have a civic responsibility to report to the nearest police formation for appropriate action,” he said. Garba also said that in carrying out the task, the police is not alone in it as the command will partner with other sister security agencies, the judiciary and other stakeholders to take out criminal elements. The police commissioner, therefore, urged law-abiding members of the community to get involved fully and get incorporated into the security architectures of their respective communities. “In this regard, the Area Commanders and DPOs have been directed to involve law-abiding members of the community in their areas of responsibilities in providing solutions on issues of crime and criminality,” he directed.
