A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant, Sam Ohuabunwa, has mentioned the only way the opposition party will win the 2023 election. Ohuabunwa, while addressing PDP chieftains in Minna on Thursday, stated that for the party to win the 2023 presidential election, it needs to maintain a righteous move in choosing its leaders. “For PDP to win the 2023 presidential election, it must do the right thing at the right time in the right way in selecting the party’s leadership,” Ohuabunwa said. He also mentioned that the increased poverty among Nigerians is responsible for Nigeria’s protracted insecurity and socio-economic challenges. The presidential aspirant noted that the way forward in addressing the menace was for Nigerians to elect an enlightened, visionary, and competent leader. “Nigeria needs a leader with good character to lead the country on the path of righteousness. “Creating an enabling environment for investment to flow would lead to creation of business opportunities, projects, programmes and wealth which would drive away poverty,” he said.
