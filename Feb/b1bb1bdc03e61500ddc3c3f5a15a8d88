A storey building consisting of 12-room apartments was on Tuesday gutted by fire at Olagunju House, GRA, Offa, Offa Local Government Area of Kwara State. An officer of the Kwara State fire department, identified as Soliu, alerted the Service to the incident which occurred at about 23:49hrs. The fire was reportedly triggered by a burning bush which later spread to an abandoned storey building formerly used as railway quarters in Offa, according to the spokesman of the state fire service, Hassan Adekunle in a statement in Ilorin on Wednesday. He said out of the 12 rooms in the storey building, six rooms were affected by the inferno before it was extinguished by the firemen. A report said an unknown person set the bush on fire and it spread to the affected storey building. Director of Kwara State Fire Service, Falade John Olumuyiwa, urged the general public to always play safe, especially in this harmattan period.
