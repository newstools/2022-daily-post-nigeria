The opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Cross River State has reacted Governor Benedict Ayade’s recent declaration to contest for president. Chairman of the party in the state, Venatius Ikem made the reaction in an interaction with DAILY POST in Calabar on Friday. Ikem said the governor was desperate because he has failed in the state. He said everybody in Nigeria and beyond knows Ayade as a professional joker and would not be taken seriously. Ikem said: “He is just grandstanding out of desperation for his doomed political future. “The entire country has come to know him as a jester. He knows nobody will ever entrust him with political power again. Not even his village people, most of whose land he has used his office to grab by force.” Ikem sarcastically said they will rejoice if APC fields Ayade as their candidate against PDP, adding that they should actually be praying and fasting that they should. The PDP boss said Ayade has performed very poorly in the area of economy. “Most businesses relocated out of Calabar to neighbouring Akwa Ibom State because of the harshness of the operating environment, epitomized by multiple taxation and harassment,” he said.
