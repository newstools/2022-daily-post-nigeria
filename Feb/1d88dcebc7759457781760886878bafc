A man in Adamawa State has confessed to having oral sex with two young boys of the same parent. The man, Abubakar Barkindo, admitted to inserting his private organ in the mouth of the boys aged eight and nine, in a fashion widely suspected to be for ritual purposes. Barkindo who said he did commit the act against the minors, claimed it was to test his manhood. The man, a trader in Yola, was said to have lured the two boys into his apartment at the Jambutu area of Jimeta, where he ejaculated into their mouths. It was learnt that nemesis caught up with him when the father of the boys while searching for them, was told by a neighbour to check Barkindo’s apartment. “I came out looking for the boys in front of the house and was told that Barkindo took them into his house. I suspected his motive, so I badged in only to see my kids with sperm in their mouths,” the father said. Barkindo who was arraigned at a Chief Magistrate Court I in Yola on Thursday, pleaded guilty to the offence, saying he wanted to see if his manhood was functioning because he had experienced erectile dysfunction in recent times. He said, “I noticed some time back that my penis was no more functional and even complained to my mother about it. I got some herbs with a view to treating it, and later decided to test whether it had resumed duty by asking the boys to play with it.” Following his guilty plea, the judge, Abdullahi Digil ordered that the defendant be remanded in prison custody, and adjourned the case to next month, March 7.
