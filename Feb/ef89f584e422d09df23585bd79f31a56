Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State has noted that President Muhammadu Buhari has been under tremendous pressure as a result of exploitative, treacherous and double-dealing antics of his very close allies and aides. The Governor was a guest on an AIT programme, Politics Today, Thursday night, where he took time to address political questions ahead of the President’s visit to his State to commission some projects. He said Nigeria is a very complex country, with some funny characters who could disappoint their principals. Ayade stated that some of Buhari’s trusted aides when entrusted with directives and assignments by the President often disappointed him, thereby putting him under strains. He said, “The system we have, even if you bring a saint, the best hand to run it, he will still have problems. Nigeria needs a strategic, long term plan. “We need to change the political kinetics, focus on our local needs and customize the system to our Afrocentric philosophy. If we continue to depend on the so-called sophisticated, imported democratic pattern system, the majority will always take it, whereas they may not necessarily be the best sometimes. “We must reduce the amount of politics in our economy. We need courageous leadership. We need new orientation, new direction and new belief to emphasise hope for the Black race.” Ayade expressed the belief that the upcoming APC national convention scheduled for February 26, 2023, will not only be successful but that the party will certainly retain power at the centre. He maintained that Buhari had given the country a direction, as well as an alternative to the oil industry.
