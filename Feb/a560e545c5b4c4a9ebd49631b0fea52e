Real Madrid are furious with manager Carlo Ancelotti and are considering sacking him, according to the UK Mirror. This follows their 1-0 defeat to Paris Saint-Germain in the first leg of their Champions League Round of 16 tie. Ancelotti’s men were set up to defend and exploit the Ligue 1 side with counter attacks. However, they eventually lost to a late sublime goal from Kylian Mbappe. Such was the nature of the defeat, Real Madrid president Florentino Perez is said to be angry and wants to replace Ancelotti. The Italian coach only returned to Madrid this summer after six years away, having been selected as the successor to Zinedine Zidane and taken from Everton. Despite guiding his side to top spot in LaLiga, Madrid are now considering Pochettino, who masterminded PSG’s first leg victory. Pochettino is also the favourite for the Manchester United job.
