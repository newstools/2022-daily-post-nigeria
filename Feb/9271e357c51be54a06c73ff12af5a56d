The Akwa Ibom State Police Command has confirmed the murder of two security guards working at Sulfuk Nigeria Ltd. fabrication yard along Terminal Road. The spokesman of the command, SP Odiko Macdon, confirmed the incident on Thursday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Eket. Macdon said that some thieves broke into the yard and killed two security guards using machetes, adding that the criminal elements also carted away armoured cables and other valuables. The PPRO said, “The Police Command in Akwa Ibom has been updated about a report going around that Ibeno indigenes killed two Eket sons in Ibeno Local Government Area (LGA). “As a command, we do not join issues with either two local governments because the constitution mandates us with the responsibility of providing security for the entire Akwa Ibom and not a particular local government area. “However, our attention has been drawn to what we can call hatred and generalisation from the two local governments. “As I speak, the Commissioner of Police, Andrew, has ordered an investigation to be conducted.”
