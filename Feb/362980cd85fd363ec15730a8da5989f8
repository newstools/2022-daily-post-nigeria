A former governor of Anambra State, Chukwuemeka Ezeife has alleged that men and some women in Nigerian politics messed up God’s design for the country. Ezeife noted that Nigeria was made for unequal greatness and to be a superpower among nations, adding that the country and its citizens were too blessed by God to be disintegrated. The former Governor and Igbo leader said this when he received Adebayo Adewole, a presidential aspirant, under the Mega Party Movement, MPM, who was on a condolence visit at his Abuja home over the death of his wife, Njideka. Ezeife said the country will overcome its current insecurity, economic and other challenges, calling on citizens especially the youth, to come together to fight their common enemies. According to the former Governor, God blessed the country more than any other country in the world, adding that no country has what Nigeria has. “The men and some of the women in Nigerian politics messed up God’s design for unequal greatness, for a superpower among nations”. “Man messed up the design but can the will of man dominate over the will of God? So, be ready to receive a new Nigeria.” Ezeife noted that with younger politicians like Adebayo, there was hope for the future of the country, adding, ” I am very happy. The problem is that our political leaders do not have a conscience.” “Conscience is dead in Nigerian politicians and that is the problem. We have to pray to God to resurrect conscience in Nigeria.” “It is not over, Nigeria is not about to disintegrate but we have to go back to God and pray that he restores his plan for Nigeria,” he said.
