Italian manager, Claudio Ranieri, has named one Inter Milan player that Liverpool should be worried about ahead of the Champions League clash on Wednesday night. Liverpool face Inter Milan in the Champions League last 16 tie, and Ranieri noted that though Inter have many players who could do damage to the Premier League side, Ivan Perisic is the chief threat. Inter are at home at the San Siro for the first leg, looking to gain an advantage to take to Anfield next month. Ranieri, a former Chelsea, Leicester and Watford boss reckons the tie is a 50-50 affair. “Inter have 50% chances to qualify,” Ranieri told Football Italia. ‘There are many players who could hurt Liverpool but I pick Ivan Perisic because he could be the right man to attack Trent Alexander-Arnold.
