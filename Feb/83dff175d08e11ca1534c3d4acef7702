The Senator representing Imo East Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Senator Ezenwa Onyewuchi has warned Gov Hope Uzodinma-led administration in Imo State and the All Progressives Congress (APC) that it should bury the idea of rigging the Ngor-Okpala by-election. The lawmaker spoke shortly after his inauguration as chairman of the Imo PDP campaign council for the bye-election on Wednesday, at the Party’s secretariat in Owerri. Onyewuchi, who represents Owerri Senatorial District, regretted that the APC and Gov. Hope Uzodinma have completely disappointed Ngor Okpala people. The lawmaker pointed out that it was unacceptable that an administration which had lasted for over two years does not have any achievement to show to Ngor Okpala people. He explained that across all sectors, it had been a tale of failure, disappointment and zero performance. Onyewuchi revealed that almost all the ongoing projects in Ngor Okpala are from the Federal Government, attracted by himself and the member representing Aboh Mbaise/Ngor Okpala Federal Constituency, Rt. Hon. Bede Eke. While insisting that Ngor Okpala is a PDP stronghold which will never be lost to the APC, the legislator further urged the people to resist any attempt by the APC to manipulate the polls. Also speaking, the State chairman of the Party, Engr. Charles Ugwuh, thanked Sen. Onyewuchi for accepting to head the campaign council. He said the choice of the Senator was a testimony to his capacity to lead the Party to success in Ngor Okpala. Ugwuh hinted that the PDP had put in place a robust structure which will deliver resounding victory at the polls. Recall that the INEC had set the date for the by-election for 26th February, alongside five other by-elections, after the Speaker of the Imo House of Assembly, Mr Kennedy Ibeh, declared the seat for Ngor Okpala State Constituency vacant.
