Nigerian football legend, Austine Jay Jay Okocha, has tipped Senegal to win the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. The Taranga Lions will on Sunday lock horns with the Pharaohs of Egypt in the 2021 edition of the binary tournament. The Pharaohs defeated the host nation, Cameroon 3-1 in a penalty shootout to reach the final while Senegal strolled past Burkina Faso in an earlier semi-final game played on Wednesday. “They have done well, you are not number one in the continent for nothing,” Okocha told Supersports ahead of the finale billed to take place on Sunday. “They have proven it, they were finalists also in the last edition so I think they will be looking forward to going one step better this time around but it’s not going to be easy.” Meanwhile, Cameroon and Burkina Faso will battle it out for a third-place on Saturday.
