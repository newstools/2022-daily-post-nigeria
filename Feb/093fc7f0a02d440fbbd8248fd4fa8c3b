The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami has said the Nigerian Government would not interfere with the prosecution of Sunday Igboho, Yoruba Nation activist. Malami said the Nigerian Government would allow the law to take its natural course in Igboho’s trial in Benin Republic. He also hinted that the Federal Government may bring Igboho back to Nigeria after he has been prosecuted in the Benin Republic. The AGF disclosed this on Channels Television’s Politics Today, yesterday, while speaking on the possibility of a political solution for Igboho. He stressed that the Federal Government would not interfere in Igboho’s case. According to Malami: “We will allow the law of the nation that was indeed breached to take its natural course and perhaps, maybe thereafter bring him back home after the conclusion of the trial over there for the purpose of facing the Nigerian law that was accordingly breached. “The position of things is that we are not interfering in aborting the existing prosecution in the foreign land, taking into consideration that the laws that were alleged to have been breached were indeed the laws of a foreign nation.” On the Federal Government considering a political solution, Malami said: “Maybe those considerations may be considered or brought to bear when he is eventually brought back after the conclusion of the trial at the foreign nation. “In terms of prosecution, you cannot rule out any possibility. In our laws, there are a lot of possibilities.” Igboho is locked up in Benin Republic after he was arrested in Cotonou last year. He was arrested with his wife, Ropo, while traveling to Germany.
