Former Arsenal defender, Martin Keown has exposed Manchester United’s major problem this season. Keown said Man United’s major problem this season under Ralf Rangnick is ‘set-piece’, adding that they must work on their corners if they wish to finish in the Premier League top four. Man United are the only team in the English Premier League this season who are yet to score from a corner. The Red Devils currently sit in the sixth position on the Premier League table with 39 points from 23 games. Writing in his column for Daily Mail, Keown said, “Manchester United’s set-piece struggles are nothing new. Previous manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer identified this as a problem, so much so that he hired a specialist set-piece coach called Eric Ramsay to try to improve them. “When you consider the players United have at their disposal, this is an area in which they are massively under-achieving. They have got more than capable deliverers of the ball in Luke Shaw and Bruno Fernandes, and they’ve prime targets in the box in Harry Maguire and Cristiano Ronaldo, among others.” He added: “despite this, United remain the only Premier League side yet to score from a corner this season. This is a key area which United need to address. Start scoring from set pieces, and their chances of a Premier League top-four finish will greatly improve.”
