The presidency has accused some Nigerian Governors of deliberately attacking President Muhammadu Buhari to distract employees of their government from monthly remuneration and pension. The Senior Special Assistant to President Buhari on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, who made the accusations in a statement on Thursday in Abuja, said the governors blame every bad thing in their State on President Buhari. According to him, some of the governors, who are known for antagonizing Mr President, have no single kilometer of road in their States constructed by their administration. Adesina opined that despite their moves to cover their failures in paying salaries and putting up infrastructures, the people of their States still hold them responsible, stressing that the citizens know where their problems are coming from. He said, “Some Governors think they can be heroes by antagonizing the President. If they owe salaries and pensions, once the month is ending, they begin to abuse the President, thinking their people would forget the outstanding salaries and pensions. When they have not built a single kilometer of road, it is Buhari. “When infrastructure has decayed under them, it is Buhari. When they can’t secure the lives and property of the people they govern, it is Buhari. “They play to the gallery, thinking they will receive applause from their people. No, the only sound the people hear is the rumbling from their bellies, due to hunger. And they know where their problems come from”.
