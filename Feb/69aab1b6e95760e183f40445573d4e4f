The Zamfara State High Court has adjourned the suit filed by Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa against the state All Progressives Congress (APC) under Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle challenging the legality of their congresses. The judge, Justice Bello Kucheri, adjourned the case for hearing on the 14th of March 2022 which was agreed by counsels of both APC factions in the state. Addressing newsmen in the court premises after the sitting, the leading counsel to Marafa, Barrister John Shaka, said they are asking the court to nullify all the congresses conducted by Governor Matawalle’s faction of the party, saying that they are illegal. According to him, the APC has its constitution but the Matawalle group was not using the provisions of the constitution, pointing out that the faction is doing things as if the party has no guiding principles. “Senator Kabiru Marafa is a chieftain of the party and has the constitutional right to challenge the illegality of the Congresses conducted by Governor Matawalle’s faction,” Shaka said. Barrister Shaka said that they are praying the court to declare the congresses illegal and order for fresh congresses from ward to state levels. In his own speech, the leading counsel to the Matawalle’s faction, Barrister Shiaka M Dikko said the court has no jurisdiction to entertain the case because Marafa has ceased to be a member of the APC. He also stated that the court will begin hearing of the case on 14th March 2022 which he said would be a legal battle.
