Ahead of the inauguration of elected state executive officers of the All Progressives Congress in Rivers State, two separate suits challenging the conduct of ward, local government and state congresses of the party in the state are set for judgment at a High Court sitting in Port Harcourt. While one of the suits was instituted by Ogechi Ogwu-Edwin and three others, the All Progressives Congress and its Caretaker Committee Chairman, Isaac Ogbobula, the second suit was filed by Alaibo Soibibo and three others against the All Progressives Congress. According to the court processes, the two sets of plaintiffs are asking the court to nullify the ward, local government and state congresses conducted by the defendants and their agents for alleged exclusion and irregularities in the entire process. Parties are present in the court, waiting for the arrival of the presiding Judge, Justice I.R Minakiri. If the judgment goes against the All Progressives Congress, their hope for inauguration alongside others states executive may be dashed. If otherwise, the defendants will be part of the inauguration slated for the 3rd of February, 2022.
