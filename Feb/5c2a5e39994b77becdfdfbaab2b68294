Former Arsenal captain, William Gallas, has warned manager, Mikel Arteta, that the Gunners need to make the top four in the Premier League this season otherwise, he has failed at Emirates. Gallas feels a top-four finish for Arsenal this season is a minimum requirement for the North London club Arteta must achieve. Arsenal is currently in the 6th position on the Premier League table with 39 points from 22 games. They have three games in hand and Gallas believes anything but a top-four finish will represent ‘failure’ from Arteta. “If they don’t finish top four, it’s a failure. It’s that simple,” Gallas told Metro UK. “When you play and manage a big club like Arsenal, your target is to finish top four. I know it’s not easy with so many clubs like City, Chelsea, United, Liverpool, Tottenham but that doesn’t matter – you have to finish in the top four at a minimum. “You have got a strong squad with Arsenal, if Arteta doesn’t make the top four, he’s failed.”
