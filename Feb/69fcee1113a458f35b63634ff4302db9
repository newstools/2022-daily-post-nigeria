A Magistrates’ Court sitting in Abeokuta has remanded the four teenage boys who killed Sofiat Okeowo for money ritual. DAILY POST recalls that Soliu Majekodunmi, the 18-year-old boyfriend of the slain girl, had strangled her on Friday while Mustakeem Balogun helped in slaughtering the 20-year-old girl, who was also his former girlfriend. They were caught alongside two others while burning the head in a local pot at the Oke Aregba area of Abeokuta., the Ogun State capital. On Thursday, the Ogun State Police Command arraigned Mustakeem (20 years), Majekodunmi (18 years), Abdulgafar Lukman (19 years) and Waris Oladeinde (18 years) in court. They were arraigned on a two-count charge of conspiracy and murder. Magistrate I. O Abudu had refused to take the plea of the defendants, ordering that they should be remanded in prison custody. According to Abudu, the defendants should be remanded in Oba Correctional Centre, pending legal advice from the Ogun State Director of Public Prosecution (DPP). The Magistrate, however, adjourned the case until March 14 for mention. The prosecutor, Insp. Lawrence Balogun had earlier informed the court that the boys committed the offence on January 28 at about 11:00 pm. According to Balogun, the defendants conspired to murder Sofiat by cutting off her head with a cutlass. The offence, he said, contravened Sections 324, 316 of the Criminal Code Laws of Ogun State, 2006.
