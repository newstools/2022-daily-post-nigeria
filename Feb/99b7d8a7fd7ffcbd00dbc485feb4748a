Popular Nigerian activist and Bring Back Our Girls campaigner, Aisha Yesufu has said President Muhammadu Buhari is hated by Nigerians because of his wrong choice of appointments. She said this shortly after the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, declared DCP Abba Kyari wanted over alleged link to drug trafficking cartels operating within Nigeria, Ethiopia and Brazil. As DAILY POST earlier reported, the NDLEA spokesperson, Femi Babafemi, had at a press briefing in Abuja on Monday, chronicled how Kyari belonged to a drug cartel that operates the Brazil-Ethiopia-Nigeria illicit drug route. Recall also that Kyari was suspended over his alleged involvement with an international fraudster, Ramon Abass, popularly known as Hushpuppi. The former Intelligence Response Team, IRT, boss was alleged to have benefitted from a heist carried out by Hushpuppi and his gang in Dubai. He, however, denied involvement in Hushpuppi’s fraudulent activities. But in a latest development, NDLEA said there is evidence linking Kyari to a drug cartel that operates the Brazil-Ethiopia-Nigeria illicit drug pipeline. The agency later released a video linking the Police officer to the drug trafficking cartel, adding that the DCP needs to answer questions that came up in an ongoing drug case in which he is the principal actor. Aisha noted that if the right people are appointed the President does not need to get involved in matters such as this, adding that Nigerians always call out the Nigerian leader because his appointees are not doing what they were appointed for. “Did you see anyone calling out Buhari on the NDLEA & Abba Kyari matter? Did Buhari himself need to be the one to apprehend Abba Kyari? Isn’t it his appointees that did that? “People don’t hate Buhari, they hate the fact that he has not appointed those that will get the jobs done,” she tweeted.
