Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi, on Thursday, ordered immediate investigation and possible arrest of gunmen who allegedly killed a soldier whose name is yet to be identified at the time of filing this report at the Boundary between Ebonyi and Enugu States. Umahi spoke to journalists through the Commissioner of Information and State Orientation, Mr. Uchenna Orji, shortly after an executive council meeting. According to him, “Today, the executive council was briefed on the killing of a soldier on duty by yet to identify gunmen in a boundary between Uburu community in Ebonyi and Mpu in Enugu State. “The executive council condemned in totality the killing and urged the security operatives to intensify efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice. “The executive council also noted the renewed hostilities in Abaomege/Ishinkwo communities over their disputed land and directed stakeholders from the area to work closely with the security agencies, with a view to identifying those who are responsible for the renewed attacks despite the state government’s resolution on the disputed land.
