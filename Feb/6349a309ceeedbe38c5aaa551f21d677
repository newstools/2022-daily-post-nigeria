Manchester City legend, Sergio Aguero, has picked the best midfielder between Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Paul Scholes. Aguero played against Gerrard, Lampard and Scholes during his time at Man City. The Argentine was forced to retire from professional football last December due to a heart condition, months after he left Man City to join Barcelona on a free transfer. The former striker began his career at Independiente before joining Atletico Madrid in 2006. In a question and answer section on Twitter on Tuesday, Aguero was asked to choose who is the best between Gerrard, Lampard or Scholes? and the former striker simply replied, ‘Lampard’. Lampard is a Chelsea legend, Gerrard is a Liverpool legend, while Scholes is a Manchester United legend.
