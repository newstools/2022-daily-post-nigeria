Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has again reiterated that the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, is the only option through which the economic and security challenges of Nigeria will be improved. Governor Ortom stated this Saturday, 5th February 2022 while interacting with journalists in Abuja on his selection as the PDP campaign chairman for the Abuja Municipal Area Council election. The Governor explained that during the 16 years PDP was in charge, the economy of the country was better with a dollar being exchanged at N90 and the security situation was also manageable. He however lamented that since the All Progressives Congress, APC, came to power in 2015, things have gone from bad to worse with a dollar now exchanging at N570. Governor Ortom maintained that insecurity, which was centred in the northeast due to activities of Boko Haram has now engulfed the entire six geopolitical zones with the ruling party having no answer to it. The Governor said the social life of the people has collapsed under the watch of the APC, stressing that no Nigerian can travel from the town to the village and socialize there without being kidnapped or killed. He assured that as the chairman of the PDP campaign council of the Abuja Municipal Area Council elections, he would ensure that the party wins and appealed to the people to vote for the party to provide the kind of leadership that Nigerians are looking for.
