Barcelona manager, Xavi Hernandez, has admitted the club cannot afford to shoot themselves in the foot after failing to offload Ousmane Dembele in the January transfer window. Xavi has now restored the France forward to his squad for Sunday’s LaLiga fixture against Atletico Madrid. Dembele’s contract expires in the summer and he was not called up for Barca’s last two fixtures, after being told to either sign a new deal or find a new club. “We did not find a solution with Ousmane, so the circumstances have now changed,” the Barca coach said in a news conference on Saturday. “We have spoken with the president [Joan Laporta] and made the decision [to reintegrate Dembele]. “He has a contract, he is part of the squad and we are not going to shoot ourselves in the foot by not using him.”
