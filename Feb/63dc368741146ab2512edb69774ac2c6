Abba Kyari, the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), has demanded N500 million in damages from the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, over alleged unlawful arrest and detention. Kyari, in an originating motion on notice, marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/182/22, filed before Justice Inyang Ekwo of a Federal High Court in Abuja, also wants for an order directing the NDLEA to tender a written apology to him in two national dailies. The motion, dated February 16 and filed February 17 by his lawyer, C. O. Ikena, also wants an order “restraining the respondent (NDLEA), its agents, servants, police, privies or anyone acting on their behalf from further harassing, detaining, intimidating, arresting the applicant unlawfully. “An order of this court directing the respondent to pay the sum of N500,000,000.00 (Five hundred million nairas) to the applicant, for unlawful violation of the applicant’s constitutional right provided for in Sections 35 and 36 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (As Amended).” In the motion to enforce his fundamental rights, Kyari also wants a declaration that his arrest and detention by the NDLEA “without bringing him before a court of competent jurisdiction from February 12 till date is unlawful, illegal, and a gross violation of his fundamental rights. Last Monday, Kyari and others were arrested by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) for alleged links with an international narcotics cartel. Last Thursday, the Police Service Commission (PSC) suspended the officers indicted for links with the international drug cartel. “DCP Abba Kyari, who prior to this allegation was on suspension, shall remain so,” the PSC wrote. Earlier, the anti-narcotics agency revealed the statements Kyari made to undercover operatives investigating the cocaine seizure.
