Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta, has confirmed that Takehiro Tomiyasu has returned to the Gunners’ squad ahead of their Premier League clash with Brentford on Saturday evening.
Arteta also confirmed that Gabriel Martinelli would not feature for Arsenal when they tackle Brentford at Emirates due to the red card the 20-year-old got in their last game. The Spaniard said this on Friday during his pre-match press conference. Arsenal head to the game following a 1-0 win over Wolves in their previous game last week. “The doubt was Tomiyasu which is still not perfect, but he’s trained the last few days, so he is in contention and we can use him,” Arteta said. “Gabi [Gabriel MartinelliGabi] is out because of the red card, but the rest of the players are okay.” The kick-off time for Arsenal vs Brentford is 4 pm.
