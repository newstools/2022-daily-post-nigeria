The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has intercepted 40,250 kilograms of Schedule 2 controlled narcotics in Lagos State. The codeine stash worth N2billion was imported in two 40ft containers from India. Foreign partners as well as Nigeria Customs, Department of State Services (DSS) and Nigerian Navy assisted the NDLEA. The consignments were brought in containers marked HLBU 2239792 with 1,125 cartons of the drug and HLBU 1067338 with 1,751 cartons. Seized at the Port Express Bonded Terminal, Berger-Apapa, the drugs were concealed behind cartons of Hypergra 200mg and deluxe chilly cutters. NDLEA Chairman, Buba Marwa, vowed that no gram of banned substances will be allowed to enter Nigeria. The latest bust followed the seizure of 14,080kg codeine syrup and 4,352.43kg cold caps in a 40ft container also imported from India.
