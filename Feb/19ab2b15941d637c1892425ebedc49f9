Residents of Ondo State on Wednesday woke up to the realisation of fuel scarcity that had been hitting major cities of the country. In Akure, the state capital, most filling stations locked their gates to motorists as they were not dispensing fuel to customers. While monitoring the situation, DAILY POST observed that some filling stations such as Total at Ado garage axis, Farbas at Oba Adesida and Arakale road were not selling to the public.  Some of the filling stations that were dispensing fuel were besieged by customers who formed long queues to get the product. Following the development, commercial drivers within Akure metropolis hiked transportation fares by over 100 percent. Residents who could not afford the fare were seen trekking long distances with the major roads in the city deserted.
