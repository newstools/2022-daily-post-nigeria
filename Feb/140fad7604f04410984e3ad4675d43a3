The African Union (AU) has suspended Burkina Faso, one week after a military takeover in the country. The body says the sanction will be in effect until constitutional order is restored. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) took similar action against Burkina Faso last Friday. President Roch Kabore is “in good spirits”, said Ghana’s Foreign Minister, Shirley Ayorkor Botchway, after seeing him. Botchway, Head of Mission to Ouagadougou, told reporters that Kabore looks well, has access to his doctors and family. The ECOWAS delegation also met coup leaders led by Lt. Col. Paul-Henri Damiba for talks on security and transition. “They seemed very open to the proposals and to us that is a good sign. “It is our position that the transition should be short so that Burkina Faso can return quickly to constitutional order”, Botchway noted. Burkina Faso is the third West African country to witness the ouster of a civilian administration since August 2020.
