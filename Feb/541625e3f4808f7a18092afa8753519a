President Muhammadu Buhari has postponed the signing of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill. A source close to the Presidency told Channels Tv that Buhari will assent to the electoral bill on Friday. According to the source, Buhari will honour the new date. Recall that the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, on Tuesday, said that the President would sign the bill between Tuesday and Wednesday. “The President will sign the electoral bill any moment from now. “It could be today, it could be tomorrow, it could be anytime, but within the 30 days,” Adesina said. The President had withheld his assent to the electoral bill in November 2021, citing the cost of conducting direct primary elections, security challenges, and possible manipulation of electoral processes as his reason.
