The House of Representatives Committee on Constitution Review has recommended immunity for Senate President, House of Representatives Speaker and heads of judiciary. The proposal is contained in the constitution amendment bill presented on Wednesday by Rep. Ahmed Wase, Chairman, Constitution Review Committee. Rep. Benjamin Kalu, House spokesperson, told reporters that since the executive was enjoying immunity, the legislature and the judiciary should also benefit. The legislature is also seeking to be part of Nigeria’s security council, NAN reports. Rep. Segun Odebunmi (APC-Oyo) sponsored the Act to alter section 308 of the constitution “to extend immunity to cover presiding officers of the legislative institutions.” The committee earlier stepped down the bill during the meeting between the committee and consultants. Several lawmakers in the Green Chamber spoke against the bill during the meeting. Abdulhamid Mohammed (SAN), one of the consultants working with the committee, opposed the immunity clause. The lawyer said globally, it was unconventional for judicial officers and presiding officers to have immunity. Mohammed warned of a conflict of interest if immunity was extended to judicial officers “You are now going to apply before the judicial officers because these are courts of competent jurisdiction”, he said.
