Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand has leapt to the defence of Ralf Rangnick and believes the German has done a good job as the club’s interim manager. Ferdinand said only Manchester United have picked up more points than Manchester United in the Premier League table since Rangnick took charge of the Red Devils last year following the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in November. Man United have collected 25 points from Rangnick’s 12 games in charge, with seven wins, four draws and one defeat. They have moved up to the fourth position in the Premier League table ahead of their three big fixtures in March against Manchester City, Liverpool and Tottenham. “There is a real Debbie Downer on Rangnick and Man United at the moment,” Ferdinand told the Vibe With Five podcast. “Yes, I think the fixture list while he’s been there has been quite favourable to Man United, but only Man City have picked up more points since he’s come in. “So he can’t be doing as badly as the way it’s spoken about in the media. In terms of points, you have to say he’s a pass at the moment. “Everyone is saying Liverpool are flying and oh my god, it is championship-winning form, they have not had as many points in the bag as Rangnick in his term since he’s been here. “I understand there are still elements in the way that his team are playing that are not fine-tuned, there is massive room for improvement all-round, I understand that.
“But in terms of the points on the table, what are you asking for? “I don’t think he is going to get the job as the manager anyway, but he’s got big games coming up now, Man City, Liverpool, Atletico Madrid, so he’s going to have to produce in those games, and he will be judged via those games I’m sure. “But in terms of points, only Man City have got more points than him in that time.”
