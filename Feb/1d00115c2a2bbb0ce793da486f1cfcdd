Suspected bandits on Sunday kidnapped Reverend Father Joseph Shekari and killed one of his cooks in Chawai, Kauru Local Government Area of Kaduna State. Ali Mudashir, a resident in the area, told DAILY POST on Monday that the bandits stormed the Catholic priest’s residence around 12:00 midnight and started shooting sporadically. According to him, in the process of running for safety, many people ran in different directions, but stray bullet hit the cook on his head, killing him instantly. According to him, the bandits succeeded in taking the priest away. “Rev Fr Shekari was kidnapped but the terrorists killed the yet-to-be-identified cook working in the parish house during the attack,” he said. He said bandits are yet to make contact with the church authority to demand ransom. ASP Mohammed Jalige did not answer his calls just as he did not respond to text messages sent to him
