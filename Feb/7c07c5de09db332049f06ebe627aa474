Senate President, Ahmed Lawan says Lagos Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu deserves a second term. He spoke on Sunday at the 5th Town Hall Meeting and Empowerment Programme organised by Lagos West Senator, Solomon Adeola, a.k.a. Yayi. Lawan hailed Sanwo-Olu for delivering dividends of good governance to the people of Lagos, NAN reports. The Senator said the All Progressives Congress (APC) has been following his achievements and that the governor should be rewarded. ”We have been watching you over the past two and half years. You have been very wonderful. “You have been consistent in terms of service delivery to the people of Lagos and indeed this country. You were focused,” he said. ”One good term you’re doing deserves another term”, the Yobe lawmaker stated. Lawan commended Adeola for his contributions to the Senate and efforts to uplift his constituents through empowerment. There are speculations that political forces are rooting for Lagos Head of Service, Hakeem Muri-Okunola to become governor in 2023. Last week, the 50-year-old lawyer issued a statement denying a plan to succeed Sanwo-Olu. He accused enemies of trying to spoil their relationship.
