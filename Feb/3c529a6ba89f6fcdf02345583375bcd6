The All Progressives Congress in Rivers State says it has uncovered plots by some members of the party loyal to Senator Magnus Abe in collaboration with leaders of the ruling Peoples Democratic party in the state, to ensure that the recent suits in which a judge recused herself from, are reassigned to a “friendly judge” that will do their biddings. The APC, in reaction to a suit by one Ogechi Ogwu-Edwin, Alaibo Soibibo and three others against the party, threatened to petition any judge who would in any way “attempt to interfere in the internal democracy of the party” to the National Judicial Commission, (NJC). The party in a statement by its state legal adviser, Iheanyichukwu Zubi-Dike, who, however, expressed confidence in the judiciary, which he described as the “last hope of the common man”, advised judges not to make themselves available as “tools in the hands of politicians to bring down” any political party. The statement said the party “appreciates the fact that litigations have been part of the process but threatened that it would not tolerate any act of distraction’” especially from those it described as faceless individuals allegedly sponsored by the leadership of the state. The statement also commended Justice I.R Minakiri for “resisting pressure”. The APC, however, urged aggrieved members to “sheath their swords” and join forces with the leadership of the party led by Chief Emeka Beke to have “a formidable team to rescue Rivers people or count their losses in their hideouts” rather than trying to prove a point to their “paymaster”.
