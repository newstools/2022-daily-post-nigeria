Apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo has described the minister of transportation, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi as a beloved son of Igbo land. Ohanaeze spoke through a statement issued by its Secretary-General, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, in reaction to the turbaning of Amaechi as ‘Dan Amanar Daura’ by the Emir of Daura. He told DAILY POST that the pan Nigerian posture of the transport minister had strengthened the cordial relationship between the North and the Eastern Nigeria. Isiguzoro said the relationship had “brightened up the opportunity for the emergence of a new Nigeria anchored on justice and equity.” He added that, “Amaechi’s title has opened a new link between the North and the Eastern region, which will boost the chance of the Igbo in 2023.” He noted that “the 2023 Igbo presidency project accommodates all prominent sons and daughters from all Igbo speaking areas, including Delta and Rivers States. “Rt. Hon. Chibuike Amaechi is the only bridge linking South-South, South-East and the North. He is more of an asset to Ndigbo, as everyone is important to the realization of the 2023 Igbo Presidency, and there will be no segregation in the project.” The Ohanaeze scribe, however, said, “Ndigbo expects more efforts that will make South-Eastern Nigeria benefit from the dividends of the Federal Government projects under the Ministry of Transport. “We have the assurances that Rt. Hon. Chibuike Amaechi will deliver all railway, deep-sea, and dry sea projects in the South-East and the South-South before the end of the year because Ndigbo is proud of the upright declaration of his Igboness, which are all marks of the beginning of his political trajectory and his future aspirations.”
