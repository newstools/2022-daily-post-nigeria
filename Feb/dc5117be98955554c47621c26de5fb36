Everton manager, Frank Lampard, has praised Alex Iwobi following their 3-0 win over Leeds United in the Premier League on Saturday. Iwobi did not score or assist but was one of the Toffees’ best players during the game. The 25-year-old provided five key passes, won six duels, made three tackles and one interception. Iwobi’s career at Goodison Park has been topsy-turvy since he joined from Arsenal in the summer of 2019. Before yesterday, the Super Eagles star had not started a league game for Everton since December and did not come on in the 3-1 loss to Newcastle on Tuesday. However, he played the full 90 minutes on Saturday afternoon, and his performance left a big impression on Lampard, who praised the Nigerian for his fantastic work ethic. Lampard said: “One of the beauties of coming in like this is it’s a restart for everybody. What Alex has done is trained at a great level. “He demanded a place in the team with his performance… He had to do a lot of work off the ball & he did everything.”
