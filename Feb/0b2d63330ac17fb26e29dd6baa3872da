Nollywood has responded to the claim by the House of Representatives that the Nigerian motion picture industry was responsible for the new trend of money rituals among young citizens in the country. DAILY POST observed that the new trend is rampant among the male gender, especially those from 15 years and above. Some Nigerians blamed the increasing rate of blood rituals on ‘corrupt’ governments for failing to provide good leadership and governance. The lower chamber had on Wednesday accused movie producers of promoting ritual killings through their movies. This followed the adoption of a motion of urgent public importance by Toby Okechukwu, the Deputy Minority Leader, at the plenary in Abuja. Presenting the motion, Okechukwu said that incidents of ritual killings had assumed an alarming rate in Nigeria while decrying the upsurge of reported ritual killings, and abductions in different parts of the country. Reacting, however, the National President of Directors Guild of Nigeria, Victor Okhai, described the allegations that Nollywood is responsible as laughable. He told reporters on Friday that the fact that Nollywood acts ritual killings in its movies just like TV stations does not make them culpable for the menace. He went further to blame the National Assembly for the situation, adding that they have failed to carry out their responsibility and keep looting the nation. “I found the news by the House of Reps saying Nollywood is responsible for rituals laughable. So, I ask, when newspapers report about rituals does that make them responsible for rituals or when radio and televisions speak about rituals does that make them culpable? “You want to know where the real problem is, it’s the National Assembly, every time you compromise and fail in carrying out your responsibilities. “Everytime you sit there and share loot you’re responsible, leave Nollywood out of it.”
