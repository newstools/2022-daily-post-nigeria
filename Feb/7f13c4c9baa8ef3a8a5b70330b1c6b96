Boko Haram members attacked communities in Niger State after killing four Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) operatives on Monday. The police confirmed four personnel died at Galadima-Kogo village in Shiroro LGA after contact with a buried Improvised Explosive Device (IED). Locals revealed that the terrorists invaded the Chubadi, Mangoro and Argida within Shiroro to loot foodstuff and others. But troops, assisted by vigilantes from the neighbouring Zuru town in Kebbi State, foiled the attempt. “The swift response by the military and vigilantes from Kebbi averted the looting attack and bloody carnage”, a source told PRNigeria. The late NSCDC officers are: ASC Mohammed Ibrahim, ASC Cheche Ahmed, IC Yunusa Mahmam and CAI Bala Abdullahi. The driver survived the explosion and is receiving treatment at a hospital in the state.
