The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate in the 2021 Anambra State governorship election, Mr. Valentine Ozigbo, has condemned the mass murder over the weekend at a funeral ceremony held in Ebenebe, Awka North LGA of Anambra State. DAILY POST reports that at least 16 mourners were killed and several others wounded when persons suspected to be cultists attacked the burial ceremony of one Mr Chibuike Joseph Chukwuka. In a statement made available to DAILY POST, Mr Ozigbo described the killing as a tragic incident, adding that it was shocking and unacceptable, and that it was a horror that should be collectively condemned. Ozigjo said: “Over the weekend, I received the report of a horrific incident in Ebenebe where about sixteen people were killed as they attended the funeral service of their relative and friend, whose life was also tragically cut short. “The images of the crime scene shared on social media are shocking, horrific, and should not be normalised in any way. “The South East, particularly Anambra State, has witnessed tragic waves of violence which have claimed the lives of hundreds of our people, both young and old. “This latest incident marks a turning point in the decline of our values as Igbos and should be unacceptable to all of us, and we must take steps as leaders to intervene. “This is not an issue to be treated with kid’s gloves or swept under the carpet. We must address the root cause of this anomaly and not just the symptoms. “We must go back to the drawing board, reassess our value system, emphasise moral values and uphold the sanctity of human life. “Importantly, we must assemble as soon as possible, the thought leaders, political, traditional, women, and youth leaders need to come together and re-evaluate our moral code. We must take steps to arrest this development before it consumes us all,” Ozigbo warned.
