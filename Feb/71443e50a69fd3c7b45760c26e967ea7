Jay Jay Okocha has said that Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp has a lot of work to do when Mohamed Salah returns to the club after Egypt’s Africa Cup of Nations final defeat to Senegal. Jay Jay Okocha, who featured in the AFCON tournament with Nigeria in 1994, also suffered three final defeats before hanging his boots. He said it was always very painful to come so close to winning a tournament but losing at the end, adding that Klopp would have to do a lot to console Salah and bring him back to shape. After losing their first game at the 33rd edition of the Africa Cup of Nations to Nigeria, Egypt progressed to the final where they lost to Senegal in a penalty shootout on Sunday. Salah’s Liverpool team-mate, Sadio Mane scored the last kick to give the west African side their ever AFCON title. “First of all, he should be happy that his players are coming back to him not injured,” Okocha said on Supersports. “And his man-management too because he has to console Mohamed Salah. You know it’s not easy to come so close and not win it. It’s painful so Klopp should have to console him. “They [Salah and Mane] have made him proud. He should be proud of them. They went out there and proved that it’s not a fluke that they’re playing for one of the best clubs in the world and it’s all about attitude for me; it’s all about commitment; it’s all about your desire to leave your mark. “You can see from just their presence, their mentality; their hard work, they never give up.”
