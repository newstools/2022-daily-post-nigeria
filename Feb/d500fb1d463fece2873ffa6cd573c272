The Muslim Rights Concern, MURIC, has accused some state governors of being Muslim-haters. MURIC, an Islamic human rights organization, identified Darius Ishaku of Taraba State, Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, and Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, as haters of Muslims in Nigeria. The group warned the governors against attempting to occupy any federal office because they have been blacklisted. Professor Ishaq Akintola, Director of MURIC, made the remark while claiming that the body has evidence of Ishaku sacking Muslim workers without following due process and replacing them with Christians. MURIC accused the Taraba State Governor of marginalizing Muslims in the state. It described as legendary, Ishaku’s alleged reckless violation of Allah-given fundamental rights of Muslims in his state. The group insisted that Ishaku was portraying a false public image of being a governor who promotes a peaceful and harmonious coexistence between Christians and Muslims in the state. A statement by Akintola reads: “We have incontrovertible evidence that Governor Darius Ishaku has been using his office to put Muslims at a disadvantage through several administrative manoeuvres and misadventures.
