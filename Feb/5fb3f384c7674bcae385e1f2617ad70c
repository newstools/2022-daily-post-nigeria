Two people have been killed by gunmen suspected to be kidnappers in separate incidents in Ondo State. Zacheus Olotu, a farmer from Oka Akoko, Akoko South West Local Government Area of the state, was kidnapped and later discovered dead in Molege, Ose Local Government Area. Zacheus and his wife were said to have been abducted between Ifon and Molege while on their way to their farm in the Ose Local Government. Following the abduction, Olotu’s wife was reportedly released to inform their families to raise money for ransom but Zacheus’ body was discovered during a search by security operatives. With his body deposited at the morgue of Iwaro-Oka General Hospital, Oba Yusufu Adebori Adeleye, the Olubaka of Oka, requested the police to investigate the incident and apprehend the perpetrators. In another incident, Sunday Okeke, popularly known as Sunny White, was shot and killed on his way to Anambra State last Saturday. According to sources, Sunday, a businessman was travelling alongside two friends when they were kidnapped. He was said to have attempted to flee into a nearby bush before being shot dead by the kidnappers as others were dragged away. Chioma, the deceased’s wife, who expressed her shock over the killing of her husband, described him as an easy-going man and urged the police and other security agencies to fish out the killers and prosecute them. SP Fumilayo Odunlami, the Ondo police spokesperson, could not be reached for comment.
