Ukraine has banned males between the ages of 18- 60 from leaving the country following invasion from Russia,” Ukraine’s State border guard service (DPSA) reported. The ban will be in place for the duration of martial law, which was imposed by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday morning after Russia attacked Ukraine. “The State Border Guard Service of Ukraine reports that due to the imposition of martial law in Ukraine, a certain category of citizens is temporarily restricted from leaving Ukraine,” the country’s interior ministry also announced at midnight via Telegram. “In particular, male citizens of Ukraine aged 18 to 60 are prohibited from leaving Ukraine. This rule will apply for the period of martial law. We ask citizens to take this information into account,” he said. Anyone caught violating martial law could end up facing military tribunals. The DPSA said the ban on males leaving the country is to guarantee Ukraine’s defence and organisation of timely mobilization. Ukrainian President also urged any Ukrainian citizen with a passport willing to fight to come forward, and promised weapons for anyone.
