Two construction workers were reportedly kidnapped along the Lambata-Izom road by terrorists in Gurara Local Government Area of Niger State. The incident occurred at about 4pm on Monday on the highway. DAILY POST gathered that the construction workers, whose actual number could not be ascertained, it was learnt, were tied up by the bandits and beaten and afterward abducted two to an unknown destination. Motorists traveling on the road were forced to wait until the terrorists finished their operations. According to them, motorists had to remain in the same position for about two hours and move when they knew that the coast was clear for them to continue their journey. However, efforts to get the reaction of the state Police Public Relations Officer, PRO, DSP Wasiu Abiodun failed as he could not be reached at the time of filing this report.
