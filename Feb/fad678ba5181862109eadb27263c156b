Cameroon captain and Africa Cup of Nations leading goal scorer, Vincent Aboubakar has blamed his teammates after their semi-final defeat to Egypt. Aboubakar accused his teammates of doing whatever they wanted on the pitch, suggesting that there was no teamwork which led to their defeat. The Indomitable Lions lost 3-1 to the Pharaohs on penalties after 120 minutes of football ended in stalemate at the Olembe stadium in Yaoundé. Cameroon were edged out despite dominating the first half of the encounter While Aboubakar scored Cameroon’s only goal during the penalty shootout, Egypt’s Abou Gabal made two saves before Clinton Njie struck his effort wide. Speaking in his post-match press conference Aboubakar, told the press, “It’s a big disappointment. “Cameroon organizes a CAN and is eliminated in the semi-finals. Everyone wanted to do what they want and here is the result today. When we play collectively, we do good things.” The Indomitable Lions will face Burkina Faso in the third-place match on Saturday.
