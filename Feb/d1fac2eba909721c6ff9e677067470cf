An All Progressives Congress, APC, Presidential aspirant, Bola Tinubu has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to hand over power to him in 2023. Tinubu anchored his call on the fact that he supported Buhari’s ambition to become president in the past. He recalled campaigning with Buhari across Nigeria in 2015. The APC National Leader said Buhari should not just leave office in 2023 but hand over power to him. He spoke during his separate visits to the Ooni of Ife and Owa Obokun of Ijesaland, in Osun State, to seek their support. According to Tinubu: “We went around the country in 2013 to campaign for Buhari. Again in 2019, we stood with him and he won. “He will soon finish his tenure. I am saying they should not just leave the post; they should hand it over to me. I cannot demand it alone. I must seek your assistance. “If monarchs in the region unite and ask for it, if we ask for the presidency gently that they should hand it over to us, I am ready to take over. “I am competent, capable and fit to pilot the affairs of the country to greatness.” Tinubu recently disclosed his intentions to succeed Buhari as Nigeria’s president. However, there are indications that the President may not support Tinubu’s Presidential ambition.
