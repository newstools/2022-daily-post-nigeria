Justice Mahmud Abdulgafar of the Kwara State High Court in Ilorin on Friday convicted 20-year-old Oyelowo Mayowa Fawas. The native of Atiba Local Government Area of Oyo State got 12 months imprisonment for cybercrime and possession of fraudulent funds. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) prosecuted him on the two counts. Oyelowo had disguised as a white female professional prostitute practising in the United States. Under the disguise, he swindled unsuspecting victims of various sums before his arrest. In count two, Oyelowo, between June 2020 to June 2021 in Ilorin, fraudulently collected N57,837,710. The offence violates Section 319A of the Penal Code. The defendant pleaded guilty to the charges. EFCC counsel, Innocent Mbachie, called a witness, Udo Iniubong, an operative to review the facts of the case. The witness told the court how credible intelligence led to the arrest of the defendant in Malete area of Kwara. Justice Abdulgafar found Oyelowo guilty and sentenced him to 6 months imprisonment on each count with an option of N100,000. His phones and laptop used to perpetrate the crime as well as the sum of $700 raised as restitution will be forfeited to the Federal Government.
