Bola Tinubu, an All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential aspirant has returned to Nigeria. Tinubu returned to Nigeria from the United Kingdom, UK, on Sunday, at about 8 pm. The flight carrying the APC National Leader touched down at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos and he was received by some leaders of his campaign team. Tinubu had a few weeks ago informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his intention to run for presidency in 2023. Shortly after hinting on running for the number one seat, the former Lagos State Governor jetted out to the UK. The APC National Leader had said his trip to the UK was part of his campaign strategy, adding that he was consulting while abroad. However, mixed reactions greeted Tinubu’s trip to London, as Nigerians claimed he travelled for medical reasons. Prior to his trip, Tinubu had visited
some parts of Nigeria like Oyo, Niger, and Zamfara States as part of his consultations.
