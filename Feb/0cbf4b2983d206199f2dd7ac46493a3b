The Zamfara State House of Assembly has expressed confidence in the witnesses presented before the investigative panel for the impeachment process against Mahadi Aliyu-Gusau, the State’s Deputy Governor. A counsel to the lawmakers and Director, Legal Matters of Zamfara House of Assembly, Nasiru Jangebe, disclosed this while speaking with journalists after the maiden sitting of the impeachment panel held at the State High Court 4, Gusau on Monday. Jangebe said, “You know, we’ve mentioned our case and led seven witnesses before the panel and the matter was adjourned to Tuesday for address. “We are satisfied with all our submissions, we believe that the witnesses are credible and unchallengeable.” On the restraining order given by the Federal High Court Abuja, Jangebe said when that order was issued, there was no impeachment process against the Deputy Governor. He said, “You know by the provision of the Constitution, once the impeachment process starts, no court should interfere in the matter. “Therefore, as far as I’m concerned, that order will not affect this process.” NAN reports that Aliyu-Gusau, who is the defendant, was absent at the sitting without a representation.
