The Rivers State government has set up a committee with a charge to return normalcy to the petroleum sector in the state. The committee which is a response to the continued scarcity of fuel across the state is headed by the Commissioner for Energy and Natural Resources Doctor Peter MEDEE and members from Petroleum Retail Outlets Owners Association of Nigeria (PETROAN), Independent Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) and security agencies. According to the Commissioner, the committee which was constituted after a meeting with officials of the ministry and petroleum marketers on Friday “is mandated to ensure that petroleum products are available and sold at the government regulated price”. The commissioner also explained that the committee will “ensure that products sourced for Rivers State are sold in Rivers state and not diverted to other locations”. The committee is also expected to make public on a “daily basis using the media details of filling stations where petrol would be bought at a government-regulated price”. Up until last Friday, most filling stations in Port had remained shut while the few that were open sold fuel between N180 and N200 per litre.
