A chieftain of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kachia Local Government, Amos Mairago on Friday condemned the attack and killing of residents as well as burning of houses in Kagarko, Kaduna by suspected Fulani militia 11 people were reportedly killed while over 51 houses were razed in Kagarko and neighbouring communities by suspected Fulani militia who stormed the area on Sunday. Reacting to the ugly incident on Friday, Mairago, a PDP Chieftain who served as the Local Government Chairman in Kachia between 2015 and 2018 described the killings as barbaric. He called on the Kaduna State government to take urgent steps to arrest the perpetrators of the evil act. ”It’s high time to stop the killings of innocent, harmless people who are only searching for their daily food, government should immediately rise to stop these daily killings of innocent people. These killers, called bandits are not spirits. They can be traced and dealt with severely by the government. ”It was disheartening to always read press releases by government expressing grief over the killing of innocent people, but the pains and grief expressed by the government is no proof of action as bandits continue to move freely, attacking their targets. “It will be difficult for people to believe that government is pained over the re-occurring attack on innocent people in the state without corresponding steps taken to deal with them by the government”.
