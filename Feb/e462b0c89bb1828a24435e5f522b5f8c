Barcelona manager, Xavi has noted that Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang struggled a bit following the former Arsenal captain’s first start since arriving at the Camp Nou. But the former midfielder hailed the Gabon international’s display, assuring he would come good at Camp Nou. Before Thursday’s Europa League clash with Napoli, Aubameyang had only appeared off the bench against Atletico Madrid and Espanyol. He was, however, handed a starting role against Napoli on Thursday night The Gabonese created his side’s best chance of the opening half, releasing Ferran Torres who blasted a woeful effort wide. Napoli took the lead through Piotr Zieliński but Ferran Torres redeemed himself from the penalty spot in the second half with the first leg finishing 1-1. And speaking on Aubameyang’s display, Xavi admitted the former Arsenal striker still needs time to click with his new teammates. “Good, very good,’” Xavi said of the former Arsenal captain. “Perhaps he struggled a bit to link up with his team-mates. He is a player with a very good physical capacity. “He has tried, his pressing was intense, which we have missed. “That is what we ask of him and then he will score and create things. He is a great player and he will contribute like Adama [Traore] and Ferran,” he added.
