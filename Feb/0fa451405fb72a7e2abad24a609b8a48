The leader of the Party in the state, Senator Zaynab Kure in her response assured party supporters of the PDP’s readiness to take back its position as the ruling party in the state. Kure who led the PDP to storm Niger south in what appears to be a show of brinkmanship to Bida assured party faithful that the PDP is fully prepared to regain its position. The Niger leader of the opposition party noted that with the level of insecurity and poor infrastructural development, the PDP has no other choice, but to rescue the state. She said, ” with the spate of insecurity, poor infrastructure across the state and the general spate of despair, we have no other option than to rescue our state and regain our place. “We will all join hands together and achieve victory and ensure PDP wins all elections henceforth.” Dr. Shem Zagbayi Nuhu and Tanko Achituwo both party stalwarts in their separate address decried the backwardness and poverty rate the state has been thrown into, adding that they will ensure the PDP emerges victorious at all levels. The meeting had in attendance party faithful from the eight councils in the zone including Bida, Lapai, Agaie, Katcha, Gbako, Lavun, Mokwa and Edati.
