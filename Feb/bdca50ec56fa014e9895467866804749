Students of D.S. Adegbenro ICT Polytechnic, Itori in Ogun State have blocked the Lagos-Abeokuta road over the alleged abduction of two of them by some suspected gunmen. It was gathered that gunmen had attacked a student’s hostel around 1 am at Afowowa, Ewekoro Local Government Area of Ogun. The students said they were angry, alleging that the police refused to respond to distress calls, saying the attack lasted for almost four hours, unhindered. “The gunmen attacked a hostel at Afowowa and operated for almost four hours. They made away with laptops and other belongings of our colleagues. We called the police but there was no response. Later, the police said their vehicle was not in good condition. “When they finally arrived, they said the students should lead in facing the gunmen. One of the students was shot in the leg and others were badly injured. That is why we took to the street to protest,” one of the protesting students told our correspondent. The students, who had earlier marched to the police station, barricaded the main road linking Abeokuta and Sango-Ota and Lagos. Commuters on the road said they have been held in traffic for hours as the students refused to drop their agitation, insisting they will continue until the kidnapped students are rescued. It was gathered that some police vans were stoned at the beginning of the protest. When contacted, the Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said he was aware of the protest. However, Oyeyemi said he had not been fully briefed about the cause of the demonstration.
