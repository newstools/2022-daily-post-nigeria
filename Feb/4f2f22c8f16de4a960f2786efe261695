Sevilla boss, Julen Lopetegui has criticised Manchester United loanee, Anthony Martial after the player’s first game for the LaLiga side on Sunday. Laptegui said the France star must give ‘much more’ to the former Europa League champions after the striker disappointed on his debut for the club. Martial moved to Sevilla on loan for the remainder of the season during the winter transfer market to rebuild his career ahead of the 2022 World Cup. Before joining the LaLiga giants, the French star had started just two Premier League matches before his move to Spain and he’s lacking in match sharpness. However, he made a less than impressive start for the Spanish side as Lopetegui’s men played out a costly 0-0 draw with Osasuna on Saturday. He was pulled out of the game with 14 minutes remaining, even with Sevilla piling forward in search of a winner and the manager warned the World Cup winner after the draw that he needs to ‘give us much more’ if he wants to remain in the starting XI. “Anthony has to give us much more,” Lopetegui told reporters after the game. “It was his first game and adaptation is not easy, he has played little this year and he has to get into dynamics and gain minutes and confidence,” he added.
