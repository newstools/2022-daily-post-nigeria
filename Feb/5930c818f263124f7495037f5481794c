One Abdulrosheed Dada has reportedly been shot dead by men of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) in Ogun State. Dada, who was popularly known as Yoboro, had died after he was shot during an encounter with the NCS operatives on Ayetoro road, near Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. It was gathered that the customs officers had on Saturday intercepted some bags of smuggled rice being conveyed to Abeokuta. In an attempt to stop the seizure of the items, the suspected smugglers were said to have engaged the law enforcement agents in a faceoff. A source told our correspondent that the deceased Dada was not initially at the scene of the incident but he was called on phone by some of the smugglers. On his arrival, the issue had got to a climax and this led to gunshots by the officers, killing Dada, an indigene of Ayetoro, Yewa North Local Government Area of Ogun State. “Abdulrosheed had gone to Abeokuta for a party before he was called by some friends, whose goods had been intercepted by customs officers. “By the time he got there, the issue had turned chaotic and the officers started shooting. The officers opened fire on them. Dada died, while two others sustained gunshot injuries,” the source said. The spokesperson of the Ogun Area 1 command of the NCS, Ahmed Oloyede, said he has not been briefed about the incident. Also, the Public Relations Officer of the Federal Operating Unit (FOU), Theophilus Duniya, denied any knowledge of the incident. However, residents of Ayetoro in Yewa have taken to social media to demand justice for Dada. Sharing his photos, they demanded that his death be investigated, calling on the government to call the officers to order.
