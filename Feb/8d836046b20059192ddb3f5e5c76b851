Manchester United forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, is planning to hold talks with his agent, Jorge Mendes, as he considers leaving the club. Ronaldo has struggled to make an impact at Old Trafford since returning last summer. The 37-year-old now wants to discuss what his options might be at the end of the season with Menses. He is hoping to have face-to-face talks with Mendes when he returns to Portugal in March for his national team’s crunch World Cup qualifier with Turkey. The UK Mirror reports Ronaldo is considering his future at United, while he waits to discover who the next permanent manager will be. The former Juventus and Real Madrid superstar has suffered a dramatic dip in form after struggling to form a positive relationship with interim boss Ralf Rangnick. Ronaldo has failed to score in his last five games, seen United crash out of the FA Cup to Middlesbrough and found himself dropped for Tuesday’s disappointing draw at rock-bottom Burnley. Ronaldo has a contract until 2023.
