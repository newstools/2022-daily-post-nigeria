Reality star, Maria Benjamin has revealed what will happen if any man tries to assault her. A fan alleged that Maria was beaten up by her man ‘Kevin’. The fan wrote: “Did Kelvin punch you today? How’s the black eye he gave you?” The BBNaija star, responding to the claim, said she would be jailed for murder the day any man assaults her. Maria said: “And if there is nothing you know about me, let me school you. The day a man touches me in that manner is the day I go to jail for murder.” She told the fan to return to her parents for home training. “Run to your parents and get them to love you differently, so you can have peace within! Stay blessed,” Maria wrote. Some followers chastised her for making such statements about murder, adding that such words could hunt her in the future. @Okpopol “Statements like this can go a long way to hunt you going forward.” @Sendarus “Avoid toxic relationship, be it friendship or dating or marriage. Because if you kill person, you don get blood on your hands oh.” @BestOjike “Please try and keep yourself in check too so you don’t attract assault.” @Eugenelexxy “She shouldn’t be saying words like ‘going to jail for murder’. Those women currently in jail for that crime are definitely regretting their actions.”
