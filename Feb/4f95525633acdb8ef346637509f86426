Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, added two special advisers to his cabinet on Tuesday. Ope George was sworn in as the SA on Public Private Partnerships (PPP) and Oluwarotimi Fashola as SA on Agriculture (Rice Mill Initiative). The governor noted that the appointment was another major step towards continued development. He said the state needed individuals who share and believe in the vision of a Greater Lagos for all. “We need people at strategic positions, who have sufficient authority and a proven track record in their different fields.” The appointees have been tested, trusted and possess the experience required in their present roles, Sanwo-Olu stressed. George, he disclosed, has strengthened engagement within the private sector and continues to attract high-level transactions and investments. Fashola, an expert in Rice Mill, is tasked with helping Lagos to boost the venture and become self-sufficient in rice production. In January, President Muhammadu Buhari, appointed Ayo Gbeleyi, a former SA on Lagos PPP, as Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN) Chairman.
