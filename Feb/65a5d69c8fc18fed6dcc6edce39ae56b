Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, had to leave Raphael Varane out of his squad to face Brighton on Tuesday in the last minute. Varane fell ill before the game and has been replaced by Victor Lindelof. United are looking to return to winning ways in the Premier League when they host Graham Potter’s men. The Red Devils have drawn their last two fixtures 1-1 against Burnley and Southampton. Rangnick’s men go into the game sitting in fifth place. Brighton travel to Old Trafford following Saturday’s 2-0 win at Watford. Victory against United would see them climb to eighth and trail United by just four points with a game in hand too.
