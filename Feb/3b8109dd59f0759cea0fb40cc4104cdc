An Anambra State High Court, in Onitsha on Wednesday, sentenced two men, Valentine Umezinwa and Emeka Okolonji, to death. They were arraigned on a two-count charge of conspiracy and murder of a sex worker, Blessing Eze (Golden). The convicts lured, murdered and dumped Blessing’s body near Dennis Memorial Grammar School (DMGS) roundabout in Onitsha. Justice D. A. Onyefulu stated that the prosecution proved its case against the duo beyond reasonable doubt. The judge said they failed to show enough reason why justice should be tempered with mercy, NAN reports. “The counsel has the option to appeal as well as go through the Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy as the Governor has the final say,” he averred. The prosecutor, N. S. Emeka, said justice had been served on the deceased, the state and the convicts. Defence counsel, Chimezie Okeke, disclosed that they would approach the Committee on the Prerogative of Mercy.
