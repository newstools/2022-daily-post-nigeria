Barcelona striker, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, has welcomed Borussia Dortmund’s Erling Haaland to Camp Nou. Aubameyang, who wants Haaland to join Barcelona in the upcoming summer transfer window, said it would be an honour for him to play with the Norway international if he ends up joining the Catalan club. Haaland has drawn the interest of Barcelona, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Chelsea in the past. “It would be an honour to play with Haaland at Barcelona. He scores a lot of goals and is very fast and physical. For his age, he’s already one of the best in the world,” Aubameyang told SPORT. “I’m always prepared for competition with my teammates, so it would be an honor to play with him if he ends up joining Barça.” Aubameyang joined Arsenal from Barcelona on the last day of the January transfer window. His signing was the fourth during the winter window, along with Dani Alves, Ferran Torres and Adama Traoré.
