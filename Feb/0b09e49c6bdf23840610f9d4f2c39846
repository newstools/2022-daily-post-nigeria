One Akinyemi Thomas has been arrested by the police for parading himself as an Inspector of the Nigeria Police Force in Ogun State. The 38-year-old Thomas was arrested on Wednesday while policemen attached to Sagamu divisional headquarters were on routine patrol of their area with the Divisional Police Officer, CSP Godwin Idehai. The cops had sighted the suspect in full police camouflage uniform under the bridge along the Lagos-Ibadan highway. The Ogun State Police spokesperson, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said on Saturday that the conduct of the suspect raised the suspicion of the patrol team, as they stopped to question him. “Immediately the patrol vehicle stopped, the suspect took to his heels. He was then chased and apprehended.
“On interrogation, he confessed being a dismissed policeman, but using the uniform to extort unsuspecting members of the public,” Oyeyemi said. He added that a police warrant card was recovered from Thomas, adding that the State Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, has ordered a full investigation into the activities.
