Chelsea assistant coach, Zsolt Low, has identified Mateo Kovacic as a ‘big leader’ in the Blues squad following their FIFA Club World Cup semi-final 1-0 win over Al-Hilal on Wednesday evening. Low, who was standing in for Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, who contracted COVID-19, said Kovacic is important for the west London club both on and off the pitch. Chelsea defeated Al-Hilal 1-0 in the FIFA Club World Cup tie, thanks to Romelu Lukaku’s first-half goal. The Premier League giants will now meet Brazilian side Palmeiras in the FIFA Club World Cup final on Saturday. Speaking at his post-match press conference, Low said, “Kova has a big experience. He played a lot of big games in his career. “He’s important on the pitch and outside it. He brought everything today. He never stopped running, stopped fighting and always tried to find the solution for his teammates. “We’re very happy to have Kova in this group. He’s a big leader.”
