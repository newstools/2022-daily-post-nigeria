Ikulu parsh is in Kauru Local Government Area of Kaduna State. DAILY POST had reported that the abductors demanded the sum of 60 million naira as a ransom for his release. In a statement on Monday, the Chancellor of the Diocese, Rev. Fr. Emmanuel Okolo, said Shekari was kidnapped at about 11.30pm on Sunday from his residence. Okolo solicited prayers from everyone, saying the Church would do everything legally possible to secure the quick and safe release of the priest. “May Jesus crucified on the cross, listen to our prayers and hasten the unconditional release of His priest and all others kidnapped,’’ he prayed.
