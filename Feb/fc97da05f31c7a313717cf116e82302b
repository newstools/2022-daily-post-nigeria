Suspected Fulani militias last night attacked Apiababum village in Atyap Chiefdom in Zangon Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State, burning all the houses after killing three persons on Sunday night. A source from the village told DAILY POST that the suspected Fulani militias fled but returned on Monday night in their large numbers to burn down the entire village. According to the source, “The way and manner the attackers carry out their attacks of recent are so worrisome in that they come in large number to ensure total destruction of any community they attack leaving no or only very few houses untouched.” He added, “Most of the villages so far attacked in Atyap land leave much to be desired because most of the villages in Atyap Chiefdom have been destroyed by the suspected Fulani militias besides the loss of lives and other valuables.” The source explained that presently, almost all the people in the village will have to manage sleeping outside their homes pending when they are able to put up structures they can rely on. ASP Mohammed Jalige, the State Police Public Relations Officer, Kaduna State Police Command, did not respond to calls put to his phone to confirm the incident.
