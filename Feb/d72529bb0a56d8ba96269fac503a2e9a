Barcelona manager, Xavi Hernandez, has revealed that hearing the Champions League anthem before Tuesday matches made him angry. The Catalans dropped out of the competition last year and will play in the Europa League. Xavi has now made it clear he is working hard to return the club to Europe’s premier competition. “Our main aim is to get back in the Champions League and there are two ways to do that: Finish in the top four in LaLiga or win the Europa League. “It hurts that we’re not there. Hearing the Champions League music on television [on Tuesday] made me angry. “But we are in another competition. It is still a European competition. It is a chance to keep growing and everyone is motivated to win a trophy that the club have never won before,” Xavi said in a news conference on Wednesday. Barcelona take on Napoli in the Europa League on Thursday.
