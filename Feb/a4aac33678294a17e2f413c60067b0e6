Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has dismissed reports that he has been chosen as the running mate to former Vice President Atiku Abubakar to fly the flag of the People’s Democratic Party in the 2023 general election. Governor Wike while calling on the general public to discountenance the report said the South was yet to make a statement on the zoning of the presidential ticket of the PDP. Stressing that the south cannot be seen as a liability, the Governor said when the South takes a position, the whole world will know that “we are not joking”. He was speaking during an interactive session with some stakeholders at the Government House Port Harcourt. “Please discountenance all those things you are hearing. The south will make a statement very soon. “The day the south makes a statement Nigerian will know that we’re not joking. “What is necessary is to make sure that the party gets it right. “We are assets, we are not liabilities. If we say we are going to support the party we will do it with everything we have.
“We are not in America where they do television campaigns no it’s not done here. “When we come out we will choke them. “So everybody should relax let the south do their proper homework and they will make a statement that will be beneficial to Nigerians and the PDP”. The Governor also took a swipe at the former Chairman of DAAR Communications, High Chief Raymon Dokpesi for asking Nigerians to discountenance zoning and claiming that the former vice president will hand over to the South-East after one term. “At the level of Dopkesi, he said he is a high chief; going to television to tell people that there is no to zoning. I can’t believe this. Even if somebody is to say it. Is he the one to say it? “And he has arrogated the power of the party to himself saying when Atiku wins, he will hand over to the South East. Is that not the decision of the party? So the party cannot take a decision at all, Dokpesi has zoned it”.
