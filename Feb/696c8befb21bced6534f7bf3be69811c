The Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, has advised religious leaders to prioritize salvation before tithe. Giwa emphasised that tithing was not included in God’s ten commandments to biblical Moses. According to the pastor, the ten commandments, often known as the Decalogue, are a set of biblical moral and worship concepts that are important in both Judaism and Christianity. While speaking to his members in Akure, the Ondo State capital, on Sunday, Giwa labelled most men of God as “today’s Pharisees,” who just preach the laws but do not follow Jesus Christ’s teachings. He said, “God wants us to teach people about loving one another. The greatest teaching is love, not tithing. Some people say you can’t make heaven if you don’t pay your tithes; this is contrary to God’s commandments. “Tithing is good but is not mandatory and there is nowhere you can see it in God’s ten commandments. “Most of us handle the church like a business, and that is why we are acting more like business owners. And when we act like that, our energy gets diluted, our priorities get twisted and unexpected things start happening. “Tithing is a prosperity message that does not win souls for God. Preach salvation, love and mercy. “Sometimes, I feel ashamed when I see or read that some men of God are mandating or forcing their members to pay tithes. “2 Corinthians 9:7 is clear about this. When you continue to preach on tithing, then, that becomes your source of income.”
