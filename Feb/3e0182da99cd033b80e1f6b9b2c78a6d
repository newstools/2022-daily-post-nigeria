President Muhammadu Buhari is currently holding a closed-door meeting with governors elected under the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, in Abuja. The meeting, which is taking place at the Council Chambers of the Presidential Villa, is not unconnected to the postponement of the party’s national convention earlier scheduled to hold February 26. Those in a attendance are Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and 18 governors, including the Yobe, Kogi, Kano, Ekiti, Kwara, Nasarawa, Ebonyi, Lagos Jigawa, Imo, Ogun, Niger Borno, Gombe, Plateau, Osun, Kebbi. Recall that the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the ruling party, yesterday, picked March 26, 2022 as a new date for its convention. Secretary of the Caretaker Committee, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, who made the announcement on Monday shortly after a closed-door meeting at the party’s secretariat in Abuja, said the preparation for the convention will commence on 24th of February 2022.
