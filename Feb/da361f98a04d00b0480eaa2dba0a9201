Over 30 suspected bandits, in the late hours of Sunday, attacked Okene Area Command of the Nigeria Police Force in Kogi State. DAILY POST learnt that one bandit was killed, while several others ran to their enclaves during the exchange of firearms between the criminals and the security personnel. In a statement on Sunday night by Kingsley Fanwo, Commissioner for Information in the State, he said the bandits bowed to superior firepower of security operatives. According to him, the bandits were shown the strength and efficacy of the Kogi security architecture as local hunters, and men of the State Vigilante Service collaborated with other security operatives to spontaneously foil the attack.

He said no innocent life was lost.
