Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State has said President Muhammadu Buhari would decide the next All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate. Zulum explained that Buhari would decide APC’s presidential candidate because he is the leader of the ruling party. He spoke in Maiduguri, the State capital on Friday when he played host to members of the Progressive Consolidation Group (PCG) led by their chairman, Dr Aliyu Rabiu Kurfias. The group had visited Zulum to promote the presidential ambition of the vice president, Yemi Osinbajo. There have been speculations that Osinbajo may run for the presidency in 2023. But, Osinbajo, through his Media Aide, Laolu Akande, had dismissed such insinuations. However, Zulum noted that individual aspirations must be in consonance with APC’s survival. According to Zulum: “Borno State will work with the party’s hierarchy, members of the National Assembly and leaders at ward and State levels to ensure the actualization of decisions to be made by President Muhammadu Buhari who is the party’s de facto leader. “I am solidly behind initiatives aimed towards enhancing the unity of our party and progress of Nigeria. “At this crucial time, no one, and nothing, will prevent the party from moving in unison. “We have to identify the right individuals to lead the nation and the task requires governors, party hierarchy and the president working in concert. “Individual aspirations may have to be downplayed because we all have to concur with the decision of the leader of our party.” Your open grazing ban will not work – Gov Zulum tells Southern Governors
