There is pandemonium in Ede, Osun State, as students of the Federal Polytechnic, Ede, took to the streets to protest the death of one of their own. DAILY POST gathered that the student was brutally murdered along with a motorcyclist in the early hours of Thursday by suspected cultists. The students, who barricaded major roads within Ede township, stormed the palace of Oba Munirudeen Adesola Lawal, the Timi of Ede land to protest the killing of Hassan Adedeji and the yet to be identified commercial motorcyclist. The action of the students prevented free flow of vehicular movements. The National President of the Federation of Ede Youths Association, Abdulazeez Mufutaudeen in a phone conversation with DAILY POST stated that the deceased student was a Higher National Diploma (HND) student of the Federal Polytechnic, Ede, who was awaiting his call up for the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC). Abdulazeez disclosed that the late student had boarded a commercial motorcycle to purchase marijuana when he was confronted by the suspected cultists with whom he allegedly had some form of misunderstanding with in the past. The killings, he also revealed, occurred around the Agbalemobode area, which is very close to the second gate. Reacting to the killings, the spokesperson of the Federal Polytechnic, Ede, Sola Lawal described the incident as unfortunate, adding that the institution’s management was saddened by the news and it is urging the students to allow the law take its course.
