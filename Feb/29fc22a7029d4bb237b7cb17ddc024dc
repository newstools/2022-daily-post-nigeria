Jack Wilshere has claimed that the reason he has not re-signed for Arsenal is that manager Mikel Arteta “doesn’t want him to”. The 30-year-old is currently a free agent and has been training with the Gunners’ first team for months as he continues his search for a new club. Meanwhile, Arteta’s first-team squad has been whittled down to 18 outfield players for the rest of this season, following a number of exits in the January transfer window. Although Wilshere would “love” to play for Arsenal again, he admits that he is “not in control” of the situation. When asked why he isn’t playing for Arsenal, Wilshere told talkSPORT: “Because the manager doesn’t want me to. Well, I don’t think he does.” Wilshere was further pressed on if the next club he signs for will be the Gunners, he replied: “I don’t know that. I would love it to be Arsenal. But I am not in control of that. “I’m talking to a few different clubs, but not in the Premier League or England.”
