Former England striker, Peter Crouch has predicted that the Premier League’s “dominance” of European football will continue in the Champions League this season. Crouch has named Liverpool and Manchester City as his two “favourites” to lift the trophy this season. City begin their knockout stage campaign against Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday night, before the Reds travel to Inter Milan on Wednesday. Holders Chelsea, who beat City in last year’s final, take on French champions Lille in the last 16 next week. “We are living through an exciting time for English football and are currently in a spell of Premier League dominance. “Two all-English finals in three years says it all and you would not bet against that turning into three out of four when Saint Petersburg comes around on May 28. “I cannot see much past the Premier League clubs. Liverpool and City are my favourites and I’m struggling to split them in Europe,” Crouch told the Daily Mail.
