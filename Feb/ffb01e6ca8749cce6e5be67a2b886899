Armed men suspected to be members of a secret cult on Saturday invaded a burial ceremony in Ebenebe, Awka North Local Government Area of Anambra State, killing about 20 persons. Our correspondent gathered that it was the burial of a suspected leader of a cult named Ozo, and while the corpse of Ozo was lying in state in his compound, some suspected cultists arrived the scene and sacked mourners, shooting at them. A source, who disclosed this to DAILY POST , said: “My sister was supposed to be at the burial. She and her friends had already prepared to leave Awka for Ebenebe, but the vehicle they booked to take them disappointed them. “She and her friends were so unhappy, and they decided to go in search of another vehicle that can take them. It was in the course of going to the burial that they received a phone call that everybody at the burial had been dispersed by some gunmen. “She also got a video from the scene, which showed several persons lying in pools of blood dead, while the corpse was desecrated, with the coffin lying far apart, while the corpse was sprawled on the ground.” DAILY POST saw the video, with members of the community wailing, while corpses littered the compound.
