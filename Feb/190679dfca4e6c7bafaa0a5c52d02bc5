Moshood Adeoti, a former Secretary to the State Government of Osun, has submitted his All Progressives Congress (APC)
gubernatorial nomination form. Adeoti, DAILY POST reliably gathered, submitted his form on Tuesday, at the National Secretariat of the APC in Abuja. It was also gathered that The Osun Progressives (TOP), a caucus of the APC, reportedly agreed to field Adeoti against Governor Adegboyega Oyetola in the party’s gubernatorial primary. The choice of Adeoti, who enjoys the support of the Rasaq Salinsile-led faction of the Osun APC has polarised the faction. The faction, which has members of The Osun Progressives (TOP), are of the view that Alhaji Moshood Adeoti does not have the pedigree to contest against the incumbent governor, Adegboyega Oyetola. Aspirants, who have indicated interest to contest the Osun APC primary in the faction which has the support of Rauf Aregbesola, a former governor of the state and current Minister of Interior include, Lasun Yusuff, a former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives and Najeem Salaam, a former Speaker of the Osun State House of Assembly. The Osun APC gubernatorial primary is scheduled to hold on Saturday, February 19, 2022.
