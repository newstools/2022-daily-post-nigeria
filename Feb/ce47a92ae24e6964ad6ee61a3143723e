Inter Miami co-owner, David Beckham has opened up on reports linking Paris Saint-Germain’s Lionel Messi with a move to the MLS side. Messi has been tipped to leave the Parc des Princes and move to the USA in the near future. The Argentine captain has endured a difficult time since joining PSG from Barcelona last summer. But Beckham has now left the door open for Messi’s potential arrival in Florida, as he stressed the importance of winning and having the best players at his club. Speaking on the development, Beckham told Miami Herald: “I have always said I want the best players in our club and playing in our shirt because there is a certain expectation. “Unfortunately, sometimes it can be a bad thing. But most of the time, it is a good thing. When I first started this project, people were saying, ‘This guy is coming; that guy is coming; [Cristiano] Ronaldo is coming; Messi’s coming. “At the end of the day, we need to win, whether it is with the young kids or stars. Our fans will be happy if we’ve stars on the team, but they will be even happier if they see young players coming through our academy and lifting the MLS Cup.”
