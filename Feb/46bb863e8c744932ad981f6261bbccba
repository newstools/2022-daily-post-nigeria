A 43-year-old Kehinde Oladimeji and his wife, Adejumoke Raji (35 years) have been arrested by the Ogun State police command for being in possession of fresh human parts in Abeokuta. The couple, who are residents of 72, MKO Abiola way Leme Abeokuta, were arrested on Saturday after a report was lodged at Kemta Police station. The Baale of Leme community, Chief Moshood Ogunwolu, had reported to the police that one Pastor Adisa Olanrewaju, who is a co-tenant with the couple, informed him of offensive odour oozing out of his neighbour’s room. Acting on the complaint, the DPO of Kemta division, CSP Adeniyi Adekunle, was said to have led his detectives to the scene. On searching the room, a plastic bowl containing fresh different parts of human being was discovered in the room, and the couple were promptly arrested, the Ogun State police image maker, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said on Saturday. “On interrogation, the suspects confessed they were herbalists and that the human parts comprising of hands, breasts and other parts were given to them by one Michael who they claimed resided in Adatan area of Abeokuta. All efforts to locate the said Michael proved abortive as the suspects could not locate his house,” Oyeyemi stated. He explained that a dismembered body of an unknown person was discovered last week around Leme area of Abeokuta. However, Oyeyemi explained that it could not confirm yet whether or not the parts is that of the found body. Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, has ordered the immediate transfer of the suspects to the homicide section, vowing that anyone who is directly or indirectly involved in the crime would be brought to book. Recently, three teenagers were arrested for beheading and burning the head of a girl for money ritual.
