The Department of State Services, DSS, on Monday, prevented counsels to Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, from having access to him in custody. Kanu’s Counsel, Aloy Ejimakor, claimed that DSS officials prevented Kanu’s counsels from seeing him last week Thursday and today (Monday). Ejimakor said the secret police said the “Special Squad” meant to receive them was on an outside assignment. “ALERT: Last Thursday, we were not allowed visitation with Onyendu because, according to DSS, the “special squad” incharge of visitations went on “outside assignment”. They asked us to come on Monday (today). “Today, we‘re at DSS. They’re telling us the same thing. We DISAGREE,” Ejimakor wrote on his Twitter handle. Kanu has been detained by the DSS after he was repatriated from Kenya in 2021. The IPOB leader is currently facing charges bordering on terrorism before Justice Binta Nyako of an Abuja Federal High Court. In July, the trial judge had ruled that access to Kanu at the DSS should be regimented.
