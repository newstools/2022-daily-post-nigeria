The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, has appealed to the Nollywood industry to join the war against drug abuse in Nigeria. The NDLEA Chairman, Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa (Retd), at the National Headquarters of the Agency in Abuja on Monday, said a number of entertainers use and encourage others to abuse drugs through their works on social media, which needs to stop. He asked that the guild set a good example by promoting messages against the use of illicit drugs through movies as the minds of millions of Nigerians are shaped through this. “A number of entertainers do not only use, they also encourage others to abuse drugs through their works and activities on social media. We want the guild to set a good example by leading the drug abuse war within its circle. “Your movies must promote messages against the use of illicit drugs because the minds of millions are shaped by what they watch in your movies. We need you to set up War Against Drug Abuse, WADA, committees within your industry,” Marwa said. Applauding the Nollywood actors and the entertainment industry for projecting the image of Nigeria, Gen. Marwa stressed that with drug use prevalence in Nigeria three times the global average, NDLEA needs committed partners like the ActorsGuild to mobilize the citizenry against the menace. The Nollywood industry under the aegis of the Actors Guild of Nigeria, AGN, at the meeting declared support for the ongoing war against drug abuse in Nigeria. National President of AGN, Emeka Rollas Ejezie, promised to reduce drug crime to the barest minimum.
