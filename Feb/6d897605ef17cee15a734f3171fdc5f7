The leadership of the Rauf Aregbesola’s faction in the All Progressives Congress (APC), Osun State has accused the state Commissioner of Police, Wale Olokode of supporting Governor Gboyega Oyetola. The leader of the group, Rasaq Salinsile accused Oyetola of masterminding attacks on members of the faction. Salinsile disclosed this at a press conference held at Oranmiyan House, in Osogbo, on Friday. Salinsile disclosed there are “intelligence reports of the Gboyega Oyetola-led IleriOluwa faction’s plan to assassinate and main us, and we had promptly passed the information to the Commissioner of Police in particular and all other security agencies. But nothing was done about it till now. “When the Chairman of SUBEB, Ajibola Famurewa publicly unveiled this atrocious plan at an event in their campaign office some days back, we wrote the Commissioner of Police, Wale Olokode, and attached the compact disc CD containing his vulgar and criminal statements. Other security agencies were copied too. Nothing was done to investigate the allegations. From our findings, the letters were dropped off as usual”. Salinsile accused the Police of punishing his faction for an offence committed against the group. According to him, “If the police engaged a quarter of the speed by which they carry out atrocities against us in carrying out their job dispassionately, we are not likely to get to this level. “The worst is that we are punished by the Commissioner of Police, Wale Olokode led police whenever such an attack happens.” As we speak, we are having five of our members, including a 68-year-old man, in Ilesa Correctional Centre. He opined that the Commissioner of Police has “sold the soul of the police to Oyetola’s government.”
