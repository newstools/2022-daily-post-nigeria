Youths believed to be members of a gang called Shila Boys in Adamawa State have killed a vigilante member in the capital, Yola. The boys allegedly descended on the vigilante, Abdulmalik Sale, at Unguwar Tabo, in the Abuja Road area of Yola Town in Yola South Local Government Area, and hacked him to death, allegedly for unwillingness to hand them his phone. Shila Boys, who operate mostly around the municipal LGAs of Yola South, Yola North and Girei, target handsets that they seize from residents in day and night operations and sell at abysmally low prices to receivers. In the latest case said to have occurred earlier this week, 23-year-old Abdulmalik, who in addition to being a vigilante is said to also work as a meter installer with an electrical service company, was attacked by the Shila Boys as he was returning home from a shop. Sources said the Shila Boys were most likely attracted to Abdulmalik by the android phone he was using at the time of the attack. “The attackers inflicted machete cuts on the late Abdulmalik and also beat him with sticks. They carted away his GSM mobile phone and fled the scene of the crime immediately,” an eyewitness said. The eyewitness added that Abdulmalik was found lying unconscious in a pool of blood with deep cuts around his body. “The victim, a member of the local vigilante group, was rushed to the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Yola. He died the following day while receiving treatment,” the eyewitness said. Spokesman of the Adamawa State Police Command, DSP Suleiman Nguroje, said the matter had not been communicated to the command.
