Paris Saint-Germain boss, Mauricio Pochettino, has insisted that it will be extra motivation for his players after UEFA moved the final of this year’s Champions League from St Petersburg to Paris. The Champions League final was initially scheduled to be played at the Gazprom Arena, Russia, on May 28. But following the invasion of Ukraine, Russia will no longer host the Champions League final. The Champions League final will instead take place at the Stade de France in Paris, France. Reacting, Pochettino told a press conference as PSG defeated St-Etienne 3-1 on Saturday: “It’s an extra motivation; there is great excitement. “We have already taken part in a Champions League final, and that is something extraordinary. But there is a lot of work ahead of us to get there.” Pochettino’s men will hope to build on their 1-0 lead when they take on Real Madrid in the Champions League round of 16 second-leg tie in March.
