No fewer than 35 suspected criminals have been arrested in various parts of Ondo State by operatives of the State Security Network Agency, Amotekun Corps. Among the arrested criminals are suspected kidnappers, armed robbers, convicted inmates who escaped from prison and vandals. The Commander of Amotekun Corps in the State, Akogun Adetunji Adeleye disclosed this while parading the suspects at the corps headquarters in Alagbaka, Akure, the state capital. According to Adeleye, underage herders as well as criminals who disguised as scavengers were also arrested. The Amotekun Commander added that the suspects were among the 150 persons arrested in January 2022. “Some of them are suspected kidnappers, armed robbers and some of them were involved in the vandalisation of 132 KVA power lines under construction. ”Some of them were ex-convicts that ran away from prison cells, some of them jumped bail and were rearrested. Some of them pretended as if they are scavengers but we found weapons, guns and locally made pistols in their trolley. “The teenage herders were caught contravening the underage anti-open grazing law. They were found to be grazing with about 300 cows. They were about 10 to 11 years of age. We are still waiting for their parents to come and face the music.” While emphasising that after discreet investigation some of the suspects will be taken to court for prosecution, Adeleye, added that others will be handed over to the police for further investigation.
