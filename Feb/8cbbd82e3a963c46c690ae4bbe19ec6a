Paris Saint-Germain are putting together a lucrative package to sign Paul Pogba on a free transfer this summer, according to SportsMail. However, Pogba is ready to leave his future at Manchester United undecided until the end of the season. It is understood the France midfielder is not ruling out extending his stay at Old Trafford. Pogba’s future remains hugely uncertain heading into the final four months of his contract with United. The 28-year-old is already free to sign a pre-contract agreement with a foreign club, but is instead focusing his attention on regaining full fitness following a thigh problem that kept him out for a long time. PSG are among the clubs with a serious interest in landing Pogba on a free transfer ahead of next season. If the World Cup winner leaves United this summer, he will be able to command a lucrative contract, which is likely to be the last major deal of his career. Despite his popularity in his country, Pogba has never played a senior domestic club game in France since leaving Le Havre for United’s academy in 2009. And while securing Pogba the player is of huge attraction to PSG, there is also a feeling that bringing the player back to France would be of major benefit commercially, too.
