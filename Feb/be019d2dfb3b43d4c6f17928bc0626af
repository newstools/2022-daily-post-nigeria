The Football Association has fined Manchester United £20,000 after the club admitted they “failed to ensure its players conducted themselves in orderly fashion” against Brighton. During the game last week, several United players surrounded referee Peter Bankes, asking him to send Lewis Dunk off in the second half. Dunk was eventually given his marching orders after a VAR check. However, a statement released by the FA on Tuesday, confirmed United have accepted the standard penalty. It reads: “Manchester United FC has been fined £20,000 for a breach of FA Rule E20.1 that took place at its Premier League against Brighton and Hove Albion FC on Tuesday, 15 February 2022 “Manchester United FC admitted failing to ensure that its players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion during the 53rd minute and accepted the standard penalty.” Dunk was dismissed for a foul on Anthony Elanga, although Bankes initially deemed Adam Webster was a covering defender.
