The publisher of Ovation Magazine International, Dele Momodu, visited the graveside of his mother as he kicked off his campaign to be president in 2023. Momodu posted the events which happened this weekend on his Instagram page. But his mother, Madam Gladys Arike Momodu nee Fatoye died in May 2007. He also visited the palace of Olufi of Gbongan, Oba Adetoyese Oyeniyi, to seek royal blessings. According to Momodu, Nigeria needs to be saved from the bad leadership that the All Progressives Congress, APC, has brought. The presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, was welcomed to the palace by relatives and family members of his late mother, as well as his supporters and admirers. Addressing the gathering at the palace, Momodu said: “I have been greatly humbled by the excitement already generated which reminds me of how it was 29 years ago when your good friend, my own adopted father, Chief Moshood Abiola, threw his hat in the ring. “It is very obvious that Nigerians are eager to restore that promise of hope and the accompanying peace and joy that we lost.”
