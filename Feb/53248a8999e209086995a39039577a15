The Minister of Transportation, Chibuke Rotimi Amaechi, has announced that the ongoing rail project leading to Niger Republic will exceed Daura, Katsina State, before the end of President Muhammadu Buhari’s tenure. Amaechi, who arrived at the Katsina Government House in the company of the Minister of State for Labour & Productivity, Festus Keyamo among other prominent politicians, made the remark while on a courtesy call to the State Governor, Aminu Bello Masari. Speaking during the visit, Amechi said “in order to ensure timely completion of the ongoing federal road project as well as the University of Transport and Technology, Daura,” he had “embarked on an inspection of the project” before coming to the Government House. Amaechi was turbaned by the Emir of Daura as the “Dan Amanar Daura” (trusted son) in Katsina on Saturday. He expressed gratitude for the gesture and confidence reposed on him by the Daura Emirate. Responding, Governor Masari, while congratulating him on the achievement noted that his “sincerity was what earned him the traditional title.
