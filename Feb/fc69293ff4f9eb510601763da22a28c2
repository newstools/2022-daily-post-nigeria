The Olubadan of Ibadan designate, Dr Lekan Balogun has said that Nigeria needs a strong leader that has national focus and acceptability to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. Balogun disclosed this in Ibadan, on Sunday, while receiving a presidential aspirant and National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, in his Alarere residence. Tinubu had visited the traditional ruler to seek his blessings and the support of Ibadan people on his presidential ambition. Balogun, who spoke through his brother, Senator Kola Balogun (PDP-Oyo South), said that the situation in Nigeria currently called for a leader that would further strengthen its unity. “Yorubas are the leading light of Nigeria, our people contributed a lot to make Nigeria what it is, and without the Yorubas, Nigeria cannot be where it is today,” the Olubadan designate said. “But, it’s very sad to note the ‘to your tent oh Israel’ that has of recent become the sing-song of the people. “We are looking forward to a Yoruba president that will further strengthen and unite the country come 2023. “We need a leader that has national focus and acceptability; the road may be rough, but, by God’s grace, you will triumph,” he said.
