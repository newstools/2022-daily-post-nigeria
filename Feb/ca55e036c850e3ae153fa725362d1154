Nineteen passengers are feared dead following a fatal road crash involving two commercial vehicles along Damaturu-Maiduguri highway on Thursday. Reports indicate that the accident occurred at Fune village, about 50km from Damaturu, the Yobe State capital. Multiple sources told DAILY POST that the accident which occurred in the early hours of Thursday was caused by overspeeding and impatience on the part of the drivers. The bodies of the deceased have been deposited at the Yobe State Specialist Hospital in Damaturu while the injured are receiving treatment in the same health facility Over speeding and dangerous overtaking by motorists are believed to be the major factors responsible for ghastly road accidents in Nigeria. This, analysts say can only be tackled when motorists are compelled to install speed limiting devices in their vehicles and are made to observe traffic rules and regulations.
