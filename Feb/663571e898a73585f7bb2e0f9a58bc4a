The Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers, NUPENG, has issued the petroleum products marketers 24 hours to revert to the official depots’ price of petrol or risk unpleasant consequences. NUPENG issued the warning on Saturday. In a statement signed by the Union’s President and General Secretary, Prince William Akporeha and Afolabi Olawale, respectively, said that unscrupulous Marketers are selling PMS (Petrol) from the depots at prices far above the official rate aimed at forcing illegal increases in the pump price. NUPENG threatened to name and shame the affected marketers if they continued with their illegal action targeted at worsening the woes of Nigerians. Part of the statement read, “Our attention and empathy have been drawn to the harrowing experiences and pains of Nigerians due to the exploitative and unscrupulous activities and tendencies of Petroleum Products Marketers who are taking advantage of the seeming gaps and teething challenges in the implementation of Petroleum Industry Act to enrich themselves at the expense of the Country and the people. “It is an undeniable fact that the Premium Motor Spirit, PMS, is still under subsidy regime, and we find it disheartening and worrisome that these unscrupulous Marketers are selling Petrol from the depots at prices far above the official rate. “We are giving these Marketers twenty-four (24) hours with effect from midnight of Sunday, 27th February, 2022 to revert to official rate or we shall name and shame them as public enemies aside from other sanctions.” NUPENG also directed its officials in all its zones to compile lists of petrol stations hoarding products during the day and selling at night at exorbitant rates for possible sanctions. “These also include Petroleum Products depots that may want to be hoarding products because of our decision on this matter.”
