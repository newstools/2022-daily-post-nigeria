An Upper Area Court sitting in Gwagwalada, FCT, on Tuesday, sentenced a 22-year-old fashion designer, Kelvin Moses to three years imprisonment for abducting and defiling a 14-year-old girl. The police charged Moses, who lives in Gwagwalada, FCT, with abduction. The Judge, Sani Umar sentenced the convict without an option of a fine after he showed remorse for his action and pleaded for leniency. “I am sentencing you without any option of fine since you have confessed to have impregnated her elder sister earlier and also had carnal knowledge of a 14-year-old girl. “You have also infected her with a disease that was not treated which has resulted in her abandoning school and staying at home,” he held. Umar said that the punishment would serve as a deterrent to those who would want to indulge in such an act. Earlier, the Prosecution Counsel, Abudulahi Tanko, told the court that the complainant, Janet Isaac, reported the matter at the Gwagwalada police station on Jan. 6. Tanko said that the convict took the complainant’s granddaughter who is 14 to his house and defiled her. The offence, he said, contravened the provision of Section 272 of the Penal Code.
