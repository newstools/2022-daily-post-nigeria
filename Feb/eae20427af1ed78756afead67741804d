West Ham have been told to sack their defender, Kurt Zouma immediately. This call came after the French player was filmed kicking and slapping his pet cat. This is the opinion of former Premier League goalkeeper, Chris Kirkland. Zouma’s brother, Yoan filmed him chasing, slapping and drop-kicking his cat and the 27-year-old later issued an apology on Monday evening. West Ham have also launched an internal investigation into the matter but Kirkland believes the Hammers should terminate Zouma’s contract. “If I was captain, I’d get him out of that dressing room. I wouldn’t want to play with him again, definitely not. “This is just about what’s right in humanity, even if you’re not an animal lover, seeing that absolutely sickened me. “I don’t think there’s any way back for him. West Ham have been backed into a corner, it’s not their fault, it’s not their fault at all, but they’ve got to handle it now and the only way for me is that he’s got to be sacked. Asked if he believes it is the end of Zouma’s career, Kirkland said, “I believe so, yes.” He noted that had Zouma committed such crime against animals on the streets, the players would have been arrested and thrown behind bars. “No club can sign him now because of the backlash it’s going to get,” he said, adding that fans will turn against any club that decides to sign the 27-year-old France international. He said the former Chelsea defender will have himself to blame for taking such career threatening action against a pet animal. at the club, nobody can sign him
