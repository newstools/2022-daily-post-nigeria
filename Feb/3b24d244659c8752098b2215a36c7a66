The Emir of Jama’are, Ahmad Muhammadu Wabi III is dead. Muhammadu Wabi was one of the longest-reigning traditional rulers in Africa and lasted over fifty years on the throne. Reacting to his death, President Muhammadu Buhari, in a statement signed by his Spokesman, Garba Shehu, described the Monarch’s death as “the end of an era.” The Emir was laid to rest on Sunday, according to the Islamic rites, and Buhari described his death as a great loss not only to Bauchi State but also to Nigeria in general. “The late Emir was a decent man who had spent fifty years serving his people without any controversy trailing his remarkable reign. “I wish to extend my heartfelt sympathy to the family, the Jama’are Emirate Council, the government and the entire people of Bauchi State over the death of this great traditional ruler,” he said. He prayed that the soul of the late monarch rest in peace and for Allah to reward his good deeds with Aljanna.
