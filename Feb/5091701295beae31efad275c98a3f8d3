The Confederation of African Football (CAF) Disciplinary Board has taken disciplinary action against Senegal ahead of their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) semi-final tie with Burkina Faso on Wednesday night. The CAF Disciplinary Board charged the Senegal FA and Equatorial Guinea players with misconduct during their AFCON 2021 quarter-final encounter last weekend following a verbal and physical altercation. This was disclosed in a statement on CAF’s website on Tuesday. The statement read in part: “The CAF Disciplinary Jury has decided: “To issue a call to order to Senegal players Saliou Ciss and Keita Belda following their regrettable behaviour at the end of the game. “To issue a call to order to Equatorial Guinea players Ivan Edu and Emilio Nsue following their regrettable behaviour at the end of the game.” Recall that Senegal had defeated Equatorial Guinea 3-1 in the AFCON quarter-final last Sunday.
