The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has said its National Executive Council will meet at the University of Lagos on February 12 and 13. According to the union, if nothing is done by the Federal Government by then, the lecturers would embark on strike. ASUU is demanding that the Federal Government implements the Memorandum of Action it signed with the union last year. The Chairman of the Kwara State University branch, Malete, Dr Salau Sheu, claims the government is avoiding its responsibility by asking ministers to oversee the implementation of the MoA. Sheu said, “It is wrong for President Muhammadu Buhari to assign two ministers to oversee the implementation of the Memorandum of Action signed last year with ASUU. “First, the assigned ministers are not part of the agreement. Only the ministers of Finance and Education were part of the agreement. “ASUU is having its National Executive Council meeting at the University of Lagos on February 12 and 13. “If nothing is done by the government between now and then, the lecturers may go on strike.” DAILY POST recalls that ASUU shut down academic activities in public universities in March 2020, until December when the Memorandum of Action (MoA) was signed with the Federal Government.
