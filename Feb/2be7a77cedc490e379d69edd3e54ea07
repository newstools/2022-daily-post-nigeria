The House of Representatives special committee on review of the 1999 Constitution has presented the first batch of its report. The Committee, chaired by Deputy Speaker Idris Wase (APC, Plateau), presented the 68 alterations to the green chamber. The First Lady, Aisha Buhari was on the floor of the House, alongside the Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen to witness the presentation. Gender-related bills are at the forefront of the ongoing Constitution review exercise. The creation of extra-seats, affirmative action and citizenship by births are some of the gender-related bills. Aside from Mrs Buhari, some women groups also assembled at the entrance of the National Assembly with placards calling for more equality for women. It would be recalled that Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila had announced on Tuesday that the House will commence the clause by clause consideration. The extra seats for women bill seek to create 37 senatorial seats and 74 federal constituencies exclusively for women.
