Former Arsenal star Ian Wright has called Kurt Zouma a ‘coward’ over the West Ham defender’s treatment of his pet cat. Footage emerged of the West Ham defender kicking and slapping his pet cat. The 27-year-old was filmed by his brother, Yoan chasing, kicking and slapping his cat. West Ham have opened an investigation into the France international’s actions and say they will deal with the incident internally. The player has since apologised for acting the way he did but Wright feels the former Chlsea star acted cowardly. Responding to a talkSPORT video which showed host Laura Woods asking, “What sort of a person are you to do something like that?” In reference to the Zouma footage, Wright said: “A coward!!!!” West Ham, who signed Zouma last summer from Chelsea for £30m, added: “The club unreservedly condemns the actions of Kurt Zouma in the video that has circulated…”
