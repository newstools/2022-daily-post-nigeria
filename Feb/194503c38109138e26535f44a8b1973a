Sixty-nine aspirants are to slug it out in the local government chairmanship primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP) scheduled for Friday, February 18 in Adamawa State. The primaries will be held in each of the 21 LGAs of the state, each of the LGAs to accommodate just one winner, meaning that only 21 of the 69 aspirants can be crowned winners. Such winners will get the party’s chairmanship ticket for the main local government election which the Adamawa State Independent Electoral Commission (ADSIEC) has scheduled for April 9 this year and in which candidates from other political parties will participate. The state Publicity Secretary of PDP, Alhaji Gidado Bello, told newsmen on Thursday that necessary arrangements had been made by the PDP leadership for successful primaries. Among the 69 aspirants to vie for the party’s chairmanship tickets on Friday are some who were recently appointed as caretaker committee chairmen after the term of elected chairmen ended. The publicity secretary of PDP assured that the local government party primaries will be conducted rancour-free. He said he was particularly happy that the councilorship primaries of the PDP, which were conducted across the 226 wards of the state on Tuesday, were “hugely successful”.
