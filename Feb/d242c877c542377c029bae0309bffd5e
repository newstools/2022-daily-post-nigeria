A 12-room residential building in Ilorin Kwara State was on Thursday gutted by fire, destroying valuables worth millions of naira. The fire disaster occurred at about 00:55hrs in the building located in Alajagusi Compound, opposite B.H.M filling station in the state capital. About eight rooms were destroyed by the inferno but firemen were still able to extinguish the fire on time. According to the spokesman of the state fire service, Hassan Adekunle, the fire was as a result of an electric power surge. Director of Kwara State Fire Service, Prince Falade John Olumuyiwa, urged citizens of the state to always cultivate the habit of switching off their electrical appliances before bedtime. He said this would help them to prevent the chances of fire outbreaks in their various homes and also help them to drastically reduce it.
