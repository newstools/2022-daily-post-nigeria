The Zamfara State Commissioner of Religious Affairs, Sheihk Sani Tukur Jangebe, has blamed the insecurity situation in the state on political stakeholders, saying that banditry will end as soon as they decide. The commissioner said this while calling on the people of the state to seek religious and western education in order to become useful and productive members of their respective societies. Jangebe made the call while delivering his sermon on the insecurity situation in the state at Muslims Foundation Jumuat Mosque, Government Reserved Area, Gusau, the state capital. According to him, even the state government cannot concentrate fully on the business of governance if the governed do not give total support to fight the bandits. “We are not happy that bandits are terrorizing the state but we in the government are trying our best to reduce the tension,” he said. The commissioner pleaded with the people of the state to support the government by giving useful information to the security agencies. He said that the federal and the state government have been trying their best to end banditry in the state.
