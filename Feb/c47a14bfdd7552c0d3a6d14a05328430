The Publicity Secretary of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Plateau State, Mr Sylvanus Namang has explained the delay in the commencement of the Jos North/Bassa Federal Constituency by-election primaries. The primaries was scheduled to hold on Tuesday, February 1, 2022, by 9am. There had been speculations in the State that Governor Lalong has endorsed his Commissioner for Commerce, Abe Aku, who recently resigned from the cabinet. While some sources attributed the delay to efforts to arrive at a consensus candidate by the State Government, Namang said that the delay was caused by the sorting of the delegates’ list. “We need to take our time to avoid any litigation that may emanate at the end of the primaries for an avoidable mistake. “The officials are taking their time to ensure that they properly sort out the list,” he added. However, before the commencement of the exercise, an aspirant for the bye-election, Hon. Suleiman Kwande, had expressed concerns over the delay in the conduct of the primaries. Kwande had last night, while speaking with journalists at the venue of the primaries said, “my expectation is dampened already because my expectation was to start the election latest by noon and finish by 6 p.m. “This is beyond that and we’re still here and as I see it, there is nobody to conduct the election. “I have no idea about what is causing the delay. “Usually, before the primaries, they would call the aspirants and other stakeholders and address them and show them the delegates’ list. “But we have not seen anything as I speak to you,” he said. Meantime, as of the time of filing this report, the primary was still ongoing as the exercise commenced around Tuesday midnight.
