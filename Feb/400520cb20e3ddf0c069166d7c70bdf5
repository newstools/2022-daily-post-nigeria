The Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) campaign council for the FCT Council polls and Governor of Benue State, Dr. Samuel Ortom, has warned the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC), not to tamper with the results of the elections in Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) and that of Kwali council. The Governor, in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary (CPS), Nat Ikyur, asked INEC to declare the results without further delay. He said INEC should not allow itself be influenced by a serving minister in the President Muhammadu Buhari administration and a serving governor from the South East to change the wishes of the people of the FCT. Governor Ortom said, “the party is in custody of results declared at the polling units and ward levels and as such will not accept anything short of victory for the PDP.” “The results of this election should not be tampered with in any way because we have credible information that a serving minister and one of the APC governors from the South East has been putting undue pressure on INEC with huge sums of money to influence the results of the election in favour of the APC. “Let it be known to everyone that the PDP will not accept anything less than a victory for the party as declared at the polling units where the PDP won with wide margins.”
