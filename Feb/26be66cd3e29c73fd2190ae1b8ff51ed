Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has accused former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar of taking convention delegates for granted. The Governor made the assertion while reacting to recent comments by Atiku that he will always clinch the presidential ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Atiku made the comments on Saturday after visiting his former boss, Olusegun Obasanjo. When asked if he was confident about securing the party’s ticket, Atiku responded, “have I ever failed to get the ticket? I am confident I will get the ticket”. Reacting to the comments, Gov. Wike, on Sunday said, “I didn’t expect him, frankly speaking, to say that he will always take the ticket of the party. That is going too far and taking the delegates for granted. “People should watch, there will be shock as far as the PDP convention is concerned. People should watch what is going to happen. People like to underrate so many people and it is not good in politics.” The Governor also assured that his party will abide by the new timetable released by the Independent National Electoral Commission.
