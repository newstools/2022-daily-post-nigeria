Christopher Inalegwu, an elder brother of the Benue State Commissioner for Information, Culture and Tourism, Michael Inalegwu, has been shot dead. DAILY POST gathered that the victim was killed on Monday during an attack at the Aku village in the Okololo ward of Agatu Local Government Area of the state. The Commissioner, Michael Inalegwu, who confirmed the incident to reporters, said his brother was killed in an unprovoked attack on his farm. According to him, no amount of attack would make the state submit to the criminal elements terrorising many parts of the state. When contacted by DAILY POST, the state’s Police Public Relations Officer, Anene Sewuese Catherin, said the issue was yet to be reported to the command.
