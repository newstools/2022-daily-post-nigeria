Civil society for the Defence of Justice has cried out against what it described as injustice meted on Mr Adeshina Adelani Adekanmbi who is alleged to have been in police custody for over three months without trial. The group appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari and the Police Service Commission to as a matter of urgency intervene on the alleged detention of Mr Adeshina Adelani Adekanmbi in police custody to ensure justice is done on the matter. The Convener of the group, Sam Adah, in a statement, explained that Mr Adeshina Adelani Adekanmbi was apprehended over a “Bureau de change” business transaction by the police acting on a petition by one Oseni Mohammed Auyo. The statement demanded that the police arraign the accused in Court or grant him bail while calling on the IGP to act against the continued detention of Mr Adeshina It also demanded that the IGP order his men, especially ASP Abdullahi Bala and Noah Reuben to ensure no harm befalls the accused in custody. The statement said while they acknowledged the power of the police to investigate crimes committed, ”the police should know that the accused is innocent until proven guilty”. The statement explained that the police served the accused a charge sheet without the date of arraignment indicated. It noted that a charge should normally have the court name and date for arraignment but that on the charge sheet served Adeshina, the police refused to indicate the day and court for his arraignment and also refused Adeshina access to contact his lawyers. According to the statement, “One will wonder what the Nigeria police is afraid of, an accused you claimed to have a case against and after being in your detention for over three (3) months you failed to arraign him in court but because the accused have served a court process on the police, the police are now trying to act a fast one by arraigning the accused in different courts secretly.” Mr Adeshina had dragged the Inspector General of Police to a Federal High Court, Lagos Division and has ordered the Nigeria Police to produce the accused in court on Wednesday the 15th of February and show a reason why he should not be granted bail, an order which was since served on the police on the 10th of February and was well acknowledged.
