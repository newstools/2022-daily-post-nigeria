Former Liverpool manager, Rafa Benitez, has backed Jurgen Klopp’s side to beat Inter Milan when both teams clash in the Champions League round of 16 first-leg tie on Wednesday. Benitez believes Liverpool are the slight favourites to progress to the Champion League quarter-final ahead of Inter Milan. The Spaniard said this while previewing the Champions League tie between Liverpool and Inter Milan for Il Corriere Dello Sport. Asked who he thinks is favourites to progress ahead of Wednesday’s first leg, Benitez responded: “For the strength of the Premier League, I say Liverpool 51 per cent and Inter 49 per cent. “It’s a more balanced game than many think. Inter didn’t qualify for the round of 16 by chance. “They always know what to do and are good at making the most of the opponents’ shortcomings. Their 3-5-2 can create trouble for teams that are not accustomed to facing it. “On the other hand, Liverpool plays with an offensive and aggressive 4-3-3. They have intensity and I expect two exciting matches. The team that will be able to keep the ball possession for a longer time will prevail. “Both have the technical abilities to make the opponents run.” He added, “I’d be worried about them, but also Diogo Jota who always makes the right movements. “However, Liverpool also have strong full-backs and are dangerous on set-pieces with Virgil Van Dijk and Joel Matip. “They have strength and intensity in the middle of the park with Fabinho. They are not an easy team to stop.”
