Chelsea legend, Didier Drogba has named one trophy he regretted not winning while at Chelsea. Drogba said he desired to win the FIFA Club World Cup and was a feat he and his generation of Chelsea stars never achieved. Drogba, who won the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup and Carling Cup during his days at Stamford Bridge, was in Dubai on Saturday to watch his former club lift the FIFA Club World Cup. “This was the ambition when I joined the club in 2004 and we started by winning the League, winning the FA Cup, winning the Carling Cup and all these domestic trophies,” the former Ivorian striker told reporters after Chelsea’s victory over Palmeiras on Saturday. “Then we tried and we managed to achieve the one with the big ears (the Champions League). I think the objective, the goal was to win the trophies.” Drogba pointed out that apart from winning trophies for Chelsea, it was also of paramount importance for them to inspire the next generations of players at the club. The Premier League legend said players such as Callum [Hudson-Odoi] and Mason [Mount] and all the guys who graduated from the youth team were inspired to win trophies. “That’s exactly what they did, another Champions League and then because they are competitors they remember they lost the one, the FIFA Club World Cup, in 2012, so they knew how important this was for the club. Now I’m here and I’m celebrating with them as well,” he said.
