Mayokun Alade, the candidate for the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the bye-election into the Akure North/Akure South Federal Constituency, on Sunday, shunned the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ, Correspondents’ Chapel debate organized for candidates contesting in the election. Others who failed to attend the debate included Oluwawemimo Felicia of the Action Democratic Party, and Opawale Tajudeen of the Social Democratic Party. The debate, which took place at the NUJ Press Centre, Akure, had only the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Olumuyiwa Adu, in attendance. Reacting, the moderator of the debate, Mr Bolu-Olu Esho said all candidates for the bye-election were well-informed and they promised to attend the debate organized for them. According to Esho, it was a surprise that some of the candidates called when the programme had started that they were holding meetings and would not be able to come as promised.
