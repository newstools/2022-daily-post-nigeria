The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) on Saturday, accused the Kwara State Police Command of foot-dragging over the killing of a Muslim student of Baptist High School, Ijagbo in Oyun Local Government of Kwara State during a peaceful protest. Habeeb Idris, a student of Baptist High School, Ijagbo, Oyun Local Government of Kwara State was shot dead during a protest over hijab. Four other students sustained varying degrees of injuries. Following this, MURIC on Saturday said the struggle for Hijab has entered another phase with the killing of a Muslim protester. The director of the faith-based human rights advocacy group, Professor Ishaq Akintola, in a statement expressed
disappointment over the attitude of the police in Kwara State. He questioned the insensitivity of the police on the case, describing it as culpable homicide, adding that, Habeeb must not die in vain. The statement said there must be consequences for thuggery and hooliganism and the use of dangerous weapons against innocent students. He said Habeeb Idris paid the supreme sacrifice in the struggle for the actualisation of Allah-given fundamental human rights of female Muslim students to use hijab, adding that his death signals another landmark in the history of the civil rights struggles by Yoruba Muslims.
