Speaking on his emergence from the seven available houses with the right to produce the Oisa, Ajayi thanked all chieftaincy houses and the leader of all the families, Chief George Adepoju for their support during the selection process. “I thank all members of the seven houses in Inisa, Odo-Ado and the overall family leader.
