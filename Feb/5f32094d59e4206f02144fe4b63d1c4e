Paris Saint-Germain manager, Mauricio Pochettino, has turned down the Manchester United job and is waiting on his dream job at Real Madrid, SportsMail reports. Pochettino is expected to leave the Ligue 1 giants in the summer unless he wins the Champions League trophy. United have been heavily linked with the Argentine tactician, but now face a battle to land him, with Real now circling as they consider him a replacement for Carlo Ancelotti. Real failed to lure Pochettino away from PSG last summer because the French club were reluctant to let him leave. Pochettino has never hidden his desire to coach Los Blancos one day and Madrid president Florentino Perez is believed to be considering him. The 49-year-old turned down a chance in 2018 when Zinedine Zidane left, and although he remains in the PSG hotseat, he has already turned down United in hope of landing the Madrid job. Pochettino knows that if Ancelotti fails to win LaLiga or continue their progress in the Champions League, the job could be his to take.
