Ex-Manchester United captain, Gary Neville, has told the club not to appoint Paris Saint-Germain boss, Mauricio Pochettino, simply because the players want him. Neville says Pochettino should only be hired if he is the choice of the United board. Last week, reports emerged that the players in the current squad want Pochettino, who has worked in the Premier League before with Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur. But Neville said on his podcast: “If Pochettino is the choice of the board then they should appoint him, but they shouldn’t appoint him based on the players wanting him. “I’d hate to think for one second that they were listening to the players in the dressing room. “They’ve got big PR machines and big social media machines and their agents are active. They have been for a good few months and I’ve not liked it for a few months. At the moment, they’re all looking after one another, thinking who they want next. “All that nonsense is happening behind the scenes at Manchester United.”
