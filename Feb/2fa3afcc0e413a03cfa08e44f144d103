The Sokoto State Governor, Honourable Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, has said only the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) can save Nigerians from the present situation they are going through. Tambuwal stated this while addressing a mammoth crowd of PDP supporters in Bamaina, residence of the former Jigawa State Governor, Alhaji Sule Lamido. He said Nigeria needs a competent leader who can restore normalcy, unity and trust in 2023. “Nigeria needs urgent attention from the concerned people to intervene through the ballots in a positive change that will come from the PDP. “We are in Jigawa and Bamaina not for campaigning, but to have a consultation with my father, the former Governor, Alhaji Sule Lamido. I need his fatherly support for my presidential ambition when the time comes”, he stressed. DAILY POST reported that Tambuwal had begun a nationwide consultation on the desirability or otherwise of him pursuing a bid for the presidency under the PDP. While reacting, Lamido said the country needs a credible leader that can bring unity among Nigerians. He urged politicians to discourage sectional or regional politics with a view to avoiding incompetent leadership.
