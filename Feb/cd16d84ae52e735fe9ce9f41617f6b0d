Former All Progressives Congress, APC, governorship aspirant in Rivers State, Dakuku Peterside, has accused the state governor, Nyesom Wike of seizing and giving off the state’s property to his friends and cronies. Peterside, who was 2015 governorship candidate of the APC, accused Wike of being on a property acquisition spree. The Opobo-born politician, who was a former Commissioner for Works during the administration of Chibuike Amaechi, said Wike had cornered no fewer than 400 houses for himself and his cronies in ways he described as “ridiculous and undignified.” Peterside expressed shock that the governor evicted some senior civil servants from their homes in the Old and new GRAs and collected their residences. “Wike will go down as the most greedy and covetous governor in Rivers’ history,” he lamented. “No governor has ever shown such a crave for obscene wealth in Nigeria’s history as Wike. “Wike’s house in his village, Rumueprikom, with all luxurious appetite that includes a helipad and bullet-proof gadgets, has become the official Government House of Rivers. “And in his unbridled lust for estate acquisition, Wike is buying-off more property, including churches, schools, and private family houses, along Ada George area of Port Harcourt, either opposite, behind, or adjacent to his palatial mansion to expand his estate. “Governor Wike behaves as if he is in control of the future, disregarding the culture of civility, equity, fairness, empathy and due process associated with the exalted office of the Governor; Wike is indeed a shame to Rivers’ people and all that the state represents,” Dakuku Peterside summed up. DAILY POST gathered that the governor recently demolished several shanties across nine waterfront settlements in Diobu, Port Harcourt area of the State, leaving thousands of residents displaced.
