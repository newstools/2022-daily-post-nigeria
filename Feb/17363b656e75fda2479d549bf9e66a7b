Chelsea striker, Romelu Lukaku, was surprised and disappointed to be left on the bench for the entirety of their Champions League round of 16 first-leg 2-0 win over Lille on Tuesday night at Stamford Bridge. Lukaku was an unused substitute as Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, opted to start Kai Havertz, Christian Pulisic and Hakim Ziyech in Chelsea’s attack line against Lille. Havertz and Pulisic scored the two goals for Chelsea to ensure they defeated the Ligue 1 side at home. Tuchel had claimed Lukaku was ‘a bit tired and exhausted’ after his ghostly display against Crystal Palace in the Premier League last weekend. But according to the Telegraph, Lukaku did not see it this way, though, and felt ready to play against Lille, upset to miss out. Lukaku will now hope to feature for Chelsea when they take on Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday at Wembley. The Belgium international is very keen to be involved against Liverpool, although now his place is in serious doubt as Havertz is currently in brilliant form. The 28-year-old re-joined Chelsea from Inter Milan last summer.
