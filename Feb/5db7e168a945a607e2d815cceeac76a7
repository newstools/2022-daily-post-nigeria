Yobe State Governor and Chairman APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Mai Mala Buni has again met with critical stakeholders of the ruling party in Kano State with a view to finding lasting solutions to the lingering crisis in the party. The meeting which was presided over Buni had in attendance, Governor Umar Ganduje, the three senators from the state, Ibrahim Shekarau, Jibrin Barau and Kabir Gaya. Buni in a statement on Saturday by his Spokesman Mamman Mohammed noted that members of the House of Representatives and other stakeholders were also in attendance.  The statement said the stakeholders had recently met twice except Governor Ganduje who was attending the meeting for the first time. Governor Buni was joined by Governor of Zamfara state Bello Matawalle and Yakubu Dogara to broker peace between the Ganduje and Shekarau factions. The stakeholders expressed satisfaction with the issues deliberated upon and pledged to resolve their differences to move the party forward. Political analysts are of the view that the reconciliation move is the right step in the right direction as the ruling party cannot afford to lose Kano State in the 2023 general elections due to its strategic importance in the political landscape of the country.
