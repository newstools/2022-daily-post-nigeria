The Network of Yobe Civil Society Organizations (NYSCO) has tasked officers and soldiers under Sector 2 Operation Hadin Kai to always respect human rights in order to win the confidence, support and cooperation of people in the ongoing counter-insurgency operation. Executive Director of NYSCO, Comrade Baba Shehu gave the charge today when he led other officials of the organization on a courtesy visit to the headquarters of Sector 2 Operation Hadin Kai in Damaturu. According to a statement signed by Usman Adamu Muhammad, Head of Public Affairs and Communication, NYSCO, indicated that the visit was aimed at extending the appreciation of the citizens and residents of Yobe to the Nigerian Army for their sacrifice and resilience in the ongoing counter-insurgency operations as well as strengthening the civil-military relationship in the areas of information-sharing and mobilizing communities’ support to address the security challenges in the state and country as a whole. In the statement, Shehu, who also pledged the support of civil society groups to the military, called for the respect of human rights of innocent citizens, as this, according to him, will boost the confidence, support and cooperation of the people.
