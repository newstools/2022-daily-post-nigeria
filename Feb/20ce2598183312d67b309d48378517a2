The Taraba State House of Assembly has screened and confirmed seven members of the Taraba State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission. The exercise, as observed by DAILY POST, took place on Thursday, at the floor of the House. Those screened and confirmed as members of the Commission, were Justice Gideon Isa Kurada-Chairman, DIG Aminchi Samaila Baraya(rtd), DSP Mohammed Adam (rtd), Hajiya Fatima Hassan, Hosea Danjuma, Samson Adda and Suzy Basho Ali. Presided over by the Speaker, Joseph Albasu Kunin, the members were enjoined by the leadership of the House to work round the clock to achieve the set up goals of the commission. Other members of the House who also spoke, urged the leadership of the House to extend the much needed helping hands to the commission to succeed in executing its assigned responsibilities. The House, it would be recalled, had earlier passed the Taraba State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission (Establishment) Law 2021, sometime in 2021. Speaking with newsmen shortly after the screening, a member of the Commission, DIG Aminchi Samaila Baraya, said the Commission would “establish a structure” that would enable them to execute the Law establishing the Commission. Other members of the commission, who also spoke with journalists, said they have collectively resolved not to leave any stone unturned and work round the clock in order not to betray the trust reposed on them.
