Poised to rid Ekiti State of kidnapping and banditry through effective funding, the Ajoni Local Council Development Area (LCDA) of the state, has established a Security Trust Fund to spearhead joint task security operations that would combat criminalities in the axis. The Council had also begun palliative works on bad portions of roads in the Council being used by criminals to perpetrate evils through minor rehabilitation works. Banditry and kidnapping have pervaded and disrupted the peace of Ajoni, which share borders with Kwara State, many had been raped and abducted, with ransoms running into millions paid by victims to regain freedom. Speaking with journalists in Ado Ekiti, on Wednesday, on the rising insecurity in the area, the Chairman of the Council, Michael Ogungbemi said the security fund would be a pool of money that would be drawn from the Local Government, Corporate bodies and the communities that constitute the LCDA. “To further strengthen security and entrench enduring peace, the leadership of Ajoni LCDA was proactive enough to introduce operation EBBORAC to combat bandits at the borders of rural Ajoni communities through surveillance, patrolling and intelligence gathering. “This joint operation that will be prosecuted by Army, Police, NSCDC, Peace Corps and Amotekun personnel, will be funded through the Security Trust Fund that will be sustained through financial contributions of our LCDA, traditional rulers and their communities as well as private business organisations operating within Ajoni to facilitate serious funding, control and supervision. ” This tripartite arrangement would enhance the collective responsibility for the peace and security of Ajoni communities and the people and allow community growth, political stability and socio-economic development. Ogungbemi added that the LCDA had also begun palliative works on bad portions along Odo Ayedun – Ayebode to Lagos and Abuja, to curtail the alarming incidences of kidnapping and banditry, and ease transportation activities in that axis. Ogungbemi added that remarkable action was a follow up to the recommendations at security and stakeholders’ meetings held in the council.
