The Michael Opeyemi Bamidele Campaign Organization has reiterated its resolve to fight the alleged injustice that characterized what it described as “kangaroo gubernatorial primaries” of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ekiti State, recently. The group further stated that Senator Bamidele and other six APC governorship aspirants will never back down in their resolve to fight the injustice that conditioned the primary election of January 27, 2022, in the state. It further clarified that a video in circulation where Bamidele was seen warning members against taking the party to court, even in the face of tyranny, was recorded at a stakeholders’ meeting in 2020, where he was appealing to party stakeholders to withdraw their cases from court in the spirit of reconciliation and unity. “We strongly detest the circulation of the video portraying Senator Bamidele as if he out rightly stands against anybody going to court against the party even in the face of tyranny, injustice and oppression as demonstrated by the Kayode Fayemi-led administration concerning the January 27 primary election.” The group further enjoined all lovers of justice, democracy and freedom to ignore the stale video as it is not relevant to the current issues at hand.
