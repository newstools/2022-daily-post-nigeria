Ex-Chelsea striker, Didier Drogba, has expressed his support for goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalag, after his costly penalty miss in the Carabao Cup final. The Blues played Liverpool in the final on Sunday at Wembley Stadium. After a goalless result in 90minutes and extra time, the match was decided in the shootout. Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, decided to bring in Kepa in place of Edouard Mendy in the 119th minute of the encounter. However, the Spaniard failed to save any of the 11 penalties he faced and went on to shoot over the bar and Liverpool won 11-10. Kepa took to his social media page to apologise to fans for his miss. Drogba retweeted the Tweet but with a comforting message. “Keep it up Kepa, my keeper, Chelsea FC.”
