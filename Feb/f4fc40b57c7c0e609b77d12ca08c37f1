Manchester United are eager to sign Antonio Rudiger from Chelsea on a free transfer this summer, the UK Mirror reports. Rudiger is into the final months of his current deal at Stamford Bridge. The Germany international has already rejected several offers from the Blues, with Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain also keen on signing him. However, United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, is a huge admirer of his compatriot. While Rudiger is reportedly seeking a deal worth £400,000-a-week, United know it could cost them more to bring in a player of Rudiger’s calibre if they are to make a major change at the back this summer. Red Devils captain, Harry Maguire, has endured a troubled season at Old Trafford where his role is believed to be undermined within the dressing room. Rangnick has publicly backed Maguire, but is exploring options to replace the England international in central defence.
