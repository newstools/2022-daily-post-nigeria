The Emir of Bauchi, Rilwanu Adamu has cautioned against allowing tribal and religious sentiment to influence the choice of leaders in the country. He warned Nigerians who are desperate to choose leadership, based on sentiments, religion and riches that it would spell doom for the country. The emir stated this while receiving a group, the Nigeria Agenda (TNA) team who paid him an Advocacy visit in his palace on Thursday in Bauchi. The Emir advised that leaders should be honest, sincere and just while carrying out their responsibilities. He commended the efforts of the TNA team for advocating the Nigeria Agenda and unity of the country, just as he prayed for their success, saying the mission of the group would change the narrative of the country. Responding, TNA spokesman, Ahmed Sajoh said they were in the palace to seek his blessings and also intimate him on their mission. He said the group advocates for unity, togetherness and for Nigerians to see the country as one entity. According to him, it’s possible to avoid introducing tribal sentiments, religious factors and the north/south dichotomy as we pursue the common good of this nation.
