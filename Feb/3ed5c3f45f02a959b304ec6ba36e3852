The Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola has broken his silence over the alleged plot to assassinate him on Monday in Osogbo, Osun State. Aregbesola alleged that unknown gunmen attacked his convoy as he approached the popular Old Garage junction in Osogbo before his security personnel, drawn from the Department of State Security, Police and other security personnel from the Paramilitary services, professionally responded to the daring attackers who were armed with diverse sophisticated weapons. In a statement by Aregbesola’s media adviser, Sola Fasure, the sponsors of the evil plot have resorted to smearing his name after having failed to achieve their mission. Aregbesola accused the Osun State government of plotting chaos in the state during the All Progressives Congress governorship primary and blaming it on his integrity. He alleged that the current administration in Osun State is planning with an array of one-man pseudo-non-governmental organizations. The statement said, “Having failed to achieve their mission of killing the minister on Monday, the sponsors of the evil plot have now resorted to smearing his name, hoping to achieve through the back door, what they can’t get fairly on the field. “The Minister, just like other Nigerians, also has the democratic right of association as enshrined in our constitution. This, in our opinion, doesn’t deserve the murder of any Nigerian, talk-less of a serving minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “The State Government of Osun, in particular, has mounted a campaign of calumny against the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) because they were providing security for some citizens in Osun while they hold meetings and warded off attacks against them,” he added.
