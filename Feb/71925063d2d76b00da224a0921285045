Manchester United loanee, Donny van de Beek has told Everton manager, Frank Lampard, his preferred position. Van de Beek said he likes to play in the Premier League as a number eight. The Dutchman joined Everton on loan from Manchester United last month. “I think I can play in different positions and I like to play in the Premier League as a number eight, box-to-box,” Van de Beek told Everton’s official website. “The manager wants me to bring some quality with the ball, to link up in midfield. “He expects a lot from me and I expect a lot from myself. I am really happy with the first two weeks.” Van de Beek will hope to feature for Everton when they take on Southampton in their next fixture on Saturday.
