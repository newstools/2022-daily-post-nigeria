Chairman, Bayelsa State Council of Traditional Rulers, HRM King Alfred Papapreye Diete-Spiff, has signed the Niger Delta Peoples Charter. The document seeks resource control, political and economic autonomy, as well as self determination of the Niger Delta people. The respected traditional leader endorsed the charter as a representative of Nembe/Brass ethnic nationalities in Bayelsa. Diete-Spiff was Military Governor of Rivers State after it was created from the old Eastern Region. The monarch was in office from May 1967 until July 1975 during the General Yakubu Gowon administration. King Diete-Spiff was also a member of the powerful Supreme Military Council. In November 2021, Nigeria Environmental Society (NES) ex-President, Engr. Olu Andah Wai-Ogosu, another Rivers representative, signed the charter. Earlier, an elder statesman, Emeritus Prof Ebiegberi Joe Alagoa, representing Bayelsa, gave his assent.
