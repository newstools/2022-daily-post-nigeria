Ramota Bello, who was on the run for allegedly killing her husband, Bello Saliu, has been arrested. The couple had engaged in a minor disagreement over the refusal of the wife to feed an Arabic student living with them. DAILY POST reported earlier that Ramota, a resident of one of the Fulani settlements at Iyana Ilewo, Abeokuta North Local Government Area of Ogun State, had poured hot water on her husband, leading to his death. She had since escaped and was declared wanted by the family of the deceased husband. Abimbola Oyeyemi, the Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), said on Thursday that the mother of two was arrested on February 21 by policemen from the Lafenwa division. “The case was not initially reported to the police until Feb.21 when the suspect was sighted in her hideout. “Upon the report, the DPO, Lafenwa division, CSP Kayode Shadrach, quickly detailed his detectives to the scene where the suspect was promptly arrested,” Oyeyemi said. Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, directed that the suspect be immediately transferred to the homicide section of the State CIID for discreet investigation and diligent prosecution.
