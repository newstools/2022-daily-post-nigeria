Retired Maj-Gen. Aminu Bande has declared that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) could floor President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2023. The governorship aspirant dismissed the incumbency factor, recalling that the APC defeated PDP in 2015 despite being in power. Bande spoke on Monday, while announcing his entry into the Kebbi State governorship race. The hopeful was the General Officer Commanding (GOC) 8 Nigerian Army Division Sokoto until retirement. Bande told reporters at the state party secretariat in Birnin Kebbi that he decided to contest to improve the lives of the people. He said the elections presented an opportunity to contribute his quota to the development of the state and Nigeria. “I feel I must join the current democratic process. My party, the PDP is there available for me to aspire to whatever position I desire. “I think 2023 will be different, if incumbency factor is anything to go by, the present administration wouldn’t have come to power at different levels. “PDP was in power in 2015, but President Buhari and other governors came onboard. The people will decide on what is good for them,” the ex-GOC stressed. PDP Chairman in Kebbi State, Usman Bello-Suru, commended Bande for choosing the opposition party and assured him of a level playing ground.
