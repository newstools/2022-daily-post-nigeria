The Segun Oni Movement in Ekiti State has accused the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of deliberate blackmail by attempting to include the names of its members in the party’s governorship campaign committee. The statement was made available to our correspondent by Jackson Adebayo, the Director of Media and Publicity of Segun Oni Movement (SOM). The group further described the leadership of the PDP campaign team as people of low esteem, maintaining that the Bisi Kolawole campaign committee was hurriedly constituted to distract the attention of the people of Ekiti State who have asserted their love for Segun Oni irrespective of any political platform he chooses to contest the June governorship election. The movement’s spokesperson further warned the leadership of the party not to play on the intelligence of the people of the state by faking names while pretending that all is well with the party. “We want to appeal to all our members who were mischievously included in the PDP masquerade lists to disregard it and be watchful as the political chemistry plays out,” he said.
