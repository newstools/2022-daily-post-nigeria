The Nigerian Navy Ship Victory (NNSV) has demolished camps used by different kidnap gangs in Cross River State. The ex-Commander, Commodore Chiedozie Okehie, made the revelation on Friday during his handover in Calabar. Okehie said the military unit carried out multiple kinetic operations involving several clearance of sea robbers and militants. “The base destroyed six camps which led to the release of some kidnapped victims, recovery of weapons and other valuable items”, he confirmed. The senior officer hailed personnel for achievements recorded in the fight against smuggling and illegal bunkering. Okehie warned criminals operating on waterways across the country to desist or face the consequences. In late 2021, the NNSV patrol team arrested a wooden boat laden with 1,209 foreign bags of parboiled rice worth N36.2million.
