Manchester United legend, Paul Scholes has singled out midfielder, Paul Pogba, for praise following the Red Devils’ Premier League 4-2 win against Leeds United on Sunday. Scholes said Pogba was ‘good’ in Man United’s midfield against Leeds star, Adam Forshaw, during the encounter. Man United defeated Leeds at Elland Road, thanks to goals from Harry Maguire, Bruno Fernandes, Fred and Anthony Elanga. Speaking about Pogba’s display, Scholes told Premier League Productions: “It’s been quite comfortable for United. They started the game really well. “Pogba has been really good, him against [Adam] Forshaw is a bit of a mismatch really. “United are good value for this. I think they have started off great, although Leeds have been disappointing.” Man United’s next match is against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League on Wednesday.
