The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has explained why Jose Peseiro will no longer take over the national team. The federation announced Peseiro as the next substantive coach of the Super Eagles, only a week after Augustine Eguavoen was put in charge on an interim basis. Eguavoen was tasked with leading the three-time champions to the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, before Peseiro took over for the 2022 World Cup playoffs against Ghana. However, the NFF has retained Eguavoen to continue as head coach, while also drafting in former international, Emmanuel Amuneke, to assist him. In a statement on Monday, NFF General Secretary, Dr Mohammed Sanusi, said: “In view of the positive performance of the Super Eagles at the just-concluded Africa Cup of Nations which has given hope to Nigerians and boosted our confidence in the present coaching crew to qualify us for the World Cup in Qatar, we have decided to accept the recommendation of the Technical and Development Committee to retain the Eguavoen-led coaching crew and strengthen it with the addition of Emmanuel Amuneke.”
