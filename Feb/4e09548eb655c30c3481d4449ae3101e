The All Progressives Congress (APC) on Thursday in Abuja screened Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, and two others. The ruling party’s primary will be held this month ahead of the July 16 governorship election. Other aspirants screened were ex-Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives, Lasun Yusuff and ex-Secretary to the State Government, Moshood Adeoti. Adeoti recently defected to the APC from the Action Democratic Party (ADP). Oyetola declared that his performance since assuming office was enough to ensure victory. “We have done so well within the last three and half years, and I have been able to justify the confidence reposed in me by the people. “I have been very much involved in the party; I’m not a novice when it comes to the issue of party administration”, he told reporters. The governor said nobody can intimidate him and that he would continue with strategic engagements. Oyetola added that he’s been going around to ask for the support of party members in all the local government areas.
