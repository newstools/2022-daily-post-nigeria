Paris Saint-Germain forward, Kylian Mbappe, moved alongside in the club’s all-time scoring charts on Saturday. Mbappe netted twice as they beat Saint-Etienne in a Ligue 1 clash. The 23-year-old signed for PSG from Monaco and has quickly become a favourite at Parc des Princes. There, however, remains doubt over Mbappe’s future though, with his contract expiring at the end of the current season. Denis Bouanga fired the visitors into the lead, before Mbappe levelled before half-time. He was on target again after the restart before Danilo Pereira put the Ligue 1 leaders 3-1 ahead. The goal took Mbappe to 156 PSG goals in all competitions, tying him with Ibrahimovic as the second most prolific scorer in the club’s history. Only Edinson Cavani, who managed 200 before leaving for Manchester United, sits ahead of the 23-year-old World Cup winner.
