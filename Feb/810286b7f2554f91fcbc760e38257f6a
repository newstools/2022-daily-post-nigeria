Former Nigeria coach, Christian Chukwu, has questioned Augustine Eguavoen’s match-reading skills. Chukwu criticized the Super Eagles interim Technical Adviser for not tweaking his tactics against Tunisia in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, which saw the team exit the tournament in a 1-0 defeat. The 1980 AFCON-winning captain however admitted that Eguavoen has made huge strides forward as a coach, as compared to the time when they worked together eight years ago. Chukwu was the Super Eagles head coach, and Eguavoen was his assistant at the 2004 Afcon, where Nigeria claimed a bronze medal. Eguavoen will continue with the national team for their 2022 World Cup playoffs against Ghana next month, but Emmanuel Amuneke has been added to the coaching crew. Ahead of the crucial two-legged ties, Chukwu has advised Eguavoen to continue to improve. “He (Eguavoen) has become a far better coach from the time he worked with me as an assistant. “He has gained more experience; he has handled strong teams. “However, I think he didn’t get the tactics right during the round of 16 match against Tunisia; he could have changed his tactics. “I think he only needs to work more on his match-reading abilities, and he will be a perfect coach,” Chukwu told the New Telegraph
