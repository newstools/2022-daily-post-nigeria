Former Nigeria international, Henry Nwosu, has hailed the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) for appointing ex-Barcelona winger, Emmanuel Amuneke, to join Augustine Eguavoen as joint-head coaches of the national team. The Super Eagles are officially without a handler after Eguavoen stepped down from his interim role following the team’s early exit from the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. The 56-year-old took over after Gernot Rohr was sacked in December. The NFF initially lined up Jose Peseiro as the substantive head coach but that appointment is yet to be ratified. Instead, the federation is understood to be considering sticking with Eguavoen and adding Amuneke to his coaching crew. “The truth is that both Eguaveon and Amuneke played this game enduringly and would formulate a deadly strategy now that NFF has given them the green light to handle the national team at last,” Nwosu told Daily Sports. “Now that it is settled, an eye must be on the ball so as to make a great result from Nigeria/Ghana Qatar 2022 World Cup pay-off coming up next month.”
