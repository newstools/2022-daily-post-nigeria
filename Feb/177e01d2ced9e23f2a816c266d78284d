A resident in the area, Alhaji Shehu Madaki, told DAILYPOST that bandits stormed the community close to Kasan Dam around 1 am on Wednesday morning. According to him, the gunmen shot sporadically as they operated for hours unchallenged.

As of the time of writing this report, neither the state government nor the police had reacted to the incident. The spokesman of the Kaduna State Police Command, ASP Mohammed Jalige, didn’t answer the calls and text messages to his phone.
