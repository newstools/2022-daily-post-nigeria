Gumel Emirate Council in Jigawa State has suspended two district and three village heads, for their delay in reporting security problems in the emirate. The emirate council Secretary, Alhaji Murtala Aliyu, disclosed this while briefing newsmen after the council’s emergency meeting held on Wednesday in Gumel. He explained that the suspended district heads were that of Jeke, Kachallan Gumel Alhaji Sani Ibrahim and that of Shabaru Dan Furyan Gumel, Alhaji Ismaila Muhammad. He added that the suspended village heads included that of Mai zuwo, Garin Danga and Yan Baro villages in Sule-Tankarkar. Aliyu said the village heads were suspended for their failure to report suspected security problems in their domains to the emirate council. The emirate council, however, commended the police and other security agencies for arresting suspected kidnappers and recovery of guns and ammunition, motorcycles and money from them. DAILY POST reported that Police in Jigawa State had raided three hideouts of criminals and arrested 14 kidnappers, who have been terrorising the state, including the recent attack where two police officers were killed and a businessman kidnapped. He added that the emirate council had also inaugurated a security committee under the chairmanship of Dan Iyan Gumel.
