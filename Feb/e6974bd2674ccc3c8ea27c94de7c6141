The decomposing corpse of a man, Ovoke Edevwie Ogwa, who was allegedly kidnapped from his compound on January 10, 2022, at Urhuovie-Abraka Community in Ethiope-East Local Government Area of Delta State has been found in the bush by locals who went to fetch firewood. His remains were found in Erho-Abraka 23 days after he was abducted, DAILY POST reports. There were signs of bullet wounds all over the decomposing body. The Special Assistant on Youth Development to Delta State Governor, Hon. Tony Adjaino, disclosed that the deceased’s abductors collected N500,000 as ransom from his family two days after his kidnap. Adjaino, who went with the police and hundreds of youths to retrieve the corpse, described the incident as “very pathetic.” According to him, “It looks like a kidnap case but there could be more to it because according to report, those who took him away on the 10th of January waited for him at his compound. “They collected N500,000 as ransom on the 12th, two days after he was taken. He was so good at his job and well patronized. He handled all my plumbing jobs.” When contacted for comments, the Delta State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Bright Edafe, refused to speak on the incident, saying, “not yet”. It was learnt that the deceased, a plumber, left behind a pregnant wife and four children.
