Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has been given a two-week deadline by the National Association of Nigerian Students Joint Campus Committee, NANS JCC, in Ondo State, to revert to previous tuitions or review it downwards. The Chairman of the NANS JCC, Comrade Surprise Omotoso, told reporters in Akure, on Monday that the governor had broken the agreement signed with them on the increase of tuitions throughout the state’s tertiary institutions in 2020. The governor had vowed to provide palliatives to mitigate the impact of the increase, such as scholarship programs and infrastructure improvements, among others. The student leader, who was flanked by other officers of the union, Abiodun Olorunfemi, Fadiran Abiola vice chairman, said “It breaks my heart to inform you that tertiary education has been removed from the grasp of the state’s poor residents. When he championed free and standard education, Chief Michael Adekunle Ajasin, the first Governor of Ondo State, understood the importance of education. “This heritage lasted until the current administration took office, with their surprising belief that education is not for the poor. The existing administration’s systematic destruction of Ondo State’s educational tradition is not only surprising but also condemnable. “While schools are starved of subvention, our government serenade themselves to luxurious lifestyles and urge schools to look inward for revenue. One wonders if truly the administration is recouping what it spent to acquire the exalted office. Daily, we watch helplessly as our colleagues drop out of school and others resort to self-help. On the incessant killing of students and residents of Akungba-Akoko by trucks due to the hilly nature of the road, the student leader urged the governor to implement the approved expansion and dualization of the road and erect barricades to check carnage on the highway.
