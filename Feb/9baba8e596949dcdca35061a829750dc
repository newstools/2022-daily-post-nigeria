The Kano State Hisbah Board has intercepted four vehicles loaded with over 4,000 bottles of assorted beer. Commander General of the agency, Sheikh Dr. Harun Muhammad Sina Ibn Sina made the disclosure to newsmen in Kano. According to him, the vehicles were apprehended along Kwanar Dangora, Kiru Madobi and Zaria to Kano road. He explained that Kano State Shari’a laws do not permit the use of beer and other intoxicants and had set aside stiffer sanctions for those found guilty. Similarly, the agency arrested miscreants engaging in prostitution, drug pushing and other unlawful acts at Panshekara. Sheikh Dr. Ibn Sina said the young men and women were arrested after receiving complaints from residents of the area. He decried the rising cases of underage youths engaged in social vices that often lead to criminal activities. The Commander-General charged parents and guardians to be more vigilant and report any suspected person or character to relevant authorities. He reaffirmed the Kano State Hisbah Board’s readiness to partner with relevant stakeholders in eradicating all forms of vices.
