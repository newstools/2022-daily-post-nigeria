Former Manchester United star, Michael Owen, has identified Chelsea goalkeeper, Edouard Mendy, as an ‘outstanding’ player following his performance against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday evening. Owen hailed Mendy for a ‘brilliant’ display against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley Stadium. Chelsea and Liverpool played a goalless draw in regulation time and failed to score a winning goal in extra time. However, Jurgen Klopp’s side defeated the Blues on penalties, claiming a dramatic 11-10 victory to win the Carabao Cup. Michael Owen lauded Mendy after the game and questioned Tuchel’s decision to take him off. “Pick a MOM [Man of the Match] between the two GK’s. Brilliant performances from both of them,” Owen posted on Twitter after the game. “How ironic. Mendy absolutely outstanding in the Chelsea goal all game. Tuchel brings him off for penalties as apparently, Kepa is better at saving them. He faces 11 and doesn’t save any. And then misses himself,” he added.
