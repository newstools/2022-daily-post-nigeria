The plaintiffs had in the suit, which was commenced via a petition, accused Adegbulugbe of a series of corporate misdemeanours, including unilateral usurpation of executive responsibilities, contrary to the provisions of the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA), 2020 and the company’s Articles. They claimed that they were unlawfully removed by the chairman (Adegbulugbe) of the company they jointly nurtured to fruition. The applicants averred that such a decision was contrary to the provisions of CAMA 2020 and the organisation’s Article of Association. Responding, Adegbulugbe also filed a separate suit against the two Directors before the court. Although the matter was formerly before Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu, the case was, however, reassigned to Justice Olajuwon, following the transfer of Ojukwu to the Calabar division of the court recently. When the matter came up before Justice Olajuwon, the parties indicated interest to settle the dispute out of court, prompting the judge to fix a date for a report of the out-of-court settlement or for the continuation of the matter. However, in the last adjourned date, the new counsel to the two Directors, Mr Uwa, told the court that he has just taken over the matter from Agbabiaka and would need more time to study the brief. The application was not opposed to by Benbella Anachebe, SAN, who was a lawyer to the plaintiff (company). The case was, however, adjourned to March 10, 2022.
