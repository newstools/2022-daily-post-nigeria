Catholic Pontiff, Pope Francis has lamented the threat of war between Russia and Ukraine. Pope Francis said the threat causes him great pains. The Pontiff spoke yesterday at the end of his weekly general audience at the Vatican in Rome. He condemned the “diabolic senselessness of violence” and asked the Madonna, “the queen of peace, to save the world from the madness of war”. “I have great pain in my heart because of the worsening of the situation in Ukraine. “I appeal to all sides to abstain from any action that could provoke more suffering to the populations, destabilising coexistence among nations and discrediting international law,” Pope Francis said. He called on politicians to make “a serious examination of conscience before God” about the effects of their actions.
