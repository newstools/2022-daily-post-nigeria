The Forum of former All Progressives Congress (APC) members in the House of Representatives has urged the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party to ensure an all inclusive and credible convention. The forum tasked the committee to ensure that internal democracy is sustained in the party. The forum made the call in a communique issued Friday and signed by its Protem Chairman, Ibrahim Zailani. It said, “The forum urged the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee to organise an all-inclusive, credible, free and transparent national Convention.” The Forum also appealed to delegates who will be attending the February 26 convention to elect credible and visionary national executives that will further unite and move the party forward. The forum also condemned the undemocratic removal of the governments of Burkina Faso and Mali, as well as the failed coup attempt in Guinea Bissau. It commended President Muhammadu Buhari for tackling insecurity, revamping the economy as well as fighting corruption and urged the government to continue in that regard.
