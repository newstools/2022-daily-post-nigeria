Liverpool legend Michael Owen has hailed Super Eagles attacker, Emmanuel Dennis after he helped Watford secure a 1-0 win away to Aston Villa on Saturday. Dennis struck the only goal of the match to secure a shock 1-0 win over Steven Gerrard’s high flying Villa in the Premier League. He powered home a header into the bottom corner after Ismaili Sarr’s delightful cross. Dennis, who joined Watford from Club Brugge, has started life in the England top flight impressively. “I was surprised with the last result with Burnley and I was equally surprised with this one, Watford winning away at Aston Villa,” Owen told Premier League Productions. “Dennis, what a player, what a signing he’s been in the Premier League this season, great finish again from him.” Dennis has now scored 9 goals and provided 5 assists for the relegation battling side in 22 league games.
