Mayokun Alade, the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate in the Akure North/Akure South Federal Constituency bye-election, was chased out of his polling unit on Saturday in Gbogi Isinkan II, Ward 3, Unit 14 of Akure South Local Government Area of Ondo State. The incident almost ruined the election at the polling unit, as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) accused Alade of vote-buying, but security operatives and APC leaders intervened quickly and wisked him away. Some persons protested against the APC candidate after he was allegedly spotted from afar offering some people money, supposedly to urge them to vote for him, according to eyewitnesses. He was alleged to have been swiftly removed from the area as protesters rallied against him, sparking a major uproar at the polling station. They said that this prohibited him from voting. Some APC members, who asked not to be identified, verified the occurrence and said that their candidate only showed his appreciation for party supporters by buying them soft drinks. They claimed that PDP members mobilized to disrupt the polling unit’s voting process in order to sabotage their candidate’s chances. They revealed that he was denied the right to vote. Alade, on the other hand, refuted the allegation, saying that “I did not pay anyone to vote in my favor.” He said that he had voted before being escorted out of the premises so as not to disrupt the poll, and expressed confidence that he would win the election because of his developmental program for Akure’s growth.
