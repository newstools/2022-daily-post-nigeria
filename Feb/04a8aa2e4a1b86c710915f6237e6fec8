As scheming for the 2023 general elections heats up following new dates approved by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC), Prof. Itse Sagay, on Sunday, said former President Goodluck Jonathan will be denigrating himself if he falls to pressures to join the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Sagay, who claims there were strong speculations that those behind the plot to bring Jonathan into the APC want him to serve as President for one term and then hand over to Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State who is the Chairman of the APC Caretaker Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), said, “Now we are hearing from the sides, former president, Goodluck Jonathan wants to join APC. Why would a man who had been president before denigrate himself to that level?”. “I hear that the conspiracy is to bring in Jonathan as APC presidential candidate and Buni as the vice-presidential candidate. “If APC wins, Jonathan will go away after four years and Buni becomes the president. That is the rumour I’m hearing now”.
