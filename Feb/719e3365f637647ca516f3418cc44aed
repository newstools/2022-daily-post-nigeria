The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, on Sunday, described its return to power in the just concluded FCT Municipal Council (AMAC) election as a sign of victory for the 2023 general elections. Dr Iyorchia Ayu, PDP’s National Chairman, in a statement he personally signed, said that the victory in the FCT area council election would be replicated in the Osun and Ekiti States governorship elections. Recall that AMAC’s PDP candidate, Christopher Zakka, polled 19,302 votes to defeat his closet rival Murtala Usman of the APC, who polled 13,240 votes. “What we have just achieved in Abuja, the seat of power, will be replicated in Ekiti and Osun states later this year, culminating in our take-over of power at the centre next year, to usher in a better, more prosperous and secure Nigeria,” he said. Ayu further stated that the PDP is back to rescue Nigeria and the victory in AMAC was “a great omen” under his watch.” He added that his leadership would lead PDP back to winning ways and rebuilding Nigeria. “The victory of our great party, the PDP, signposts the promise of a better Nigeria under my watch, leading this team of dedicated and committed party members. “This victory is dedicated to all leaders of our party, particularly the state governors, NEC members, NWC members as well as the millions of party members across the nation”, Ayu said.
