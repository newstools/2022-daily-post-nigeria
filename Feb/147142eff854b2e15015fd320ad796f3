The Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) has mentioned companies that brought adulterated Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) into the country. The Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Mele Kyari, addressed reporters Wednesday night in Abuja. The contaminated petrol has damaged vehicles of an unknown number of citizens and companies, with queues in Abuja, Lagos and some other States. Kyari said the PMS was imported from Antwerp in Belgium with quality inspectors failing to detect the high level of methanol. The GMD disclosed that the NNPC first got report on the presence of emulsion particles in cargoes shipped to Nigeria on January 20. “NNPC investigation revealed the presence of Methanol in Four (4) PMS cargoes imported by the following DSDP suppliers namely: “MRS MT Bow Pioneer LITASCO Terminal, Antwerp-Belgium, Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium MT Tom Hilde; Oando MT Elka Apollon; Duke Oil MT Nord Gainer,” he said. He noted that cargo quality certificates issued at load port (Antwerp-Belgium) by AmSpec Belgium showed the gasoline complied with Nigerian specification. NNPC quality inspectors, including GMO, SGS, GeoChem and G&G also conducted tests before discharge. The cargoes were equally certified by inspection agent appointed by the Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority. Kyari said the NNPC had ordered the quarantine of all un-evacuated volumes and the holding back of all the affected products in transit. Defaulting suppliers have been put on notice for remedial actions, while the state oil company and relevant agencies will take further actions in line with subsisting regulations.
