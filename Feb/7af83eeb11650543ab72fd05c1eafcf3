Popular Afrobeat singer, Seun Kuti has asked Nigerians to grow up and face serious issues in the country. Kuti said this while reacting to the excitement from Nigerians over sex tapes involving celebrities. The internet has been agog after the alleged sex tape of singer, Oxlade surfaced online. Kuti, on his Instagram page, wondered why a country with over 90percent religious persons would be so concerned about a sex video. His post read: “Stop flooding my timeline with someone else sex stories please. “You all are infants, grow up and face the real ish! “For a country that is over 90 percent religious, you and your kids are really fascinated by sex. Fathers, mothers uncles and aunties, I’m sure you watch porn inside church sef.”
