The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has issued a one-week ultimatun to the Federal Government to address the issues raised by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), leading to a one month warning strike. The students body said, the Federal government has one week to resolve the crisis or students would embark on a national mass action across the country. President of the student’s association, Sunday Adedayo, stated this on Monday, in Sokoto shortly after signing the reviewed Constitution of the association at the Sokoto State Government House. “The Nigerian students have concluded and given the mandate that if the Federal Government and ASUU do not resolve this between today and Friday, Nigerian students should mobilise and give the language the government understands. “A day of national mass action has been fixed – February 28, which is next week Monday. Every Nigerian student that the ASUU strike has sent home should block all the Federal roads and the office of the Minister of Education and the office of the Minister of Labour should also be blocked. If Nigerian students are at home, office of the Minister of Education and Minister of Labour cannot be opened,” the NANS President said. In a statement, Adebayo described as unfortunate the attitude of the Federal Government, lamenting that frequent strikes have bastardised Nigeria’s educational system. The student body was in Sokoto for the review of its Constitution after 30 years of its existence.
