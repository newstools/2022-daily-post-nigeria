The former Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, on Monday, warned those aspiring to be president, governors, senators and other political offices to brace up for more problems in 2023. Sanusi warned that aspirants should understand that they would face multiple problems next year. The former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, said aspiring leaders face multiple problems than what past leaders faced in 2015. The leader of the Khalifa of Tijaniyya sect in Nigeria, spoke at a reception organised in his honour, as part of activities marking the 80th birthday of Babanla Adinni of Egbaland, Chief Tayo Sowunmi, in Abeokuta, Ogun State. Sanusi said Nigerians should elect competent leaders who can move the country out of the doldrums or blame themselves. According to Sanusi: “We should look at all the candidates very well. We should choose people that we think are competent and honest. “To be honest, we are living on extra time. In 2015, we were in a deep hole. In 2023, we will be in an even much deeper hole than in 2015. “I hope all those who are struggling to be President understand that the problems they are going to face are multiples of the problems that were faced in 2015. All of us should be ready for difficult decisions and if they are taken, we are all going to pay for them.”
