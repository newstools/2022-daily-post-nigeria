Former Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Appropriation, Abdulmumin Jibrin, has claimed that 14 state governors have already thrown their weights behind former Lagos State Governor, Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s presidential ambition. Jibrin had earlier said Tinubu would surely succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023, adding that the All Progressives Congress, APC’s national leader is the best candidate from the party. Tinubu had a few weeks ago declared his intention to run in the presidential election in 2023. “14 Governors in and 4 in talks. 26 state Chairmen in. We will not attack or stop anybody from contesting. We are exercising our right of choice by promoting Alhaji Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. “Do same for yours pls. We will remain gracious and our doors open now and after the victories,” Jibrin tweeted. The latest member of the APC to declare his intention for the position is a former Governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha. Okorocha announced his intention on Wednesday in a letter to the Senate President, which was read by Ahmad Lawan at the senate plenary.
