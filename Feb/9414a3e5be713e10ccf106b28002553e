The Federal Government of Nigeria has confirmed engagement with governors to address disagreement over right-of-way (ROW). Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu, lamented that the conflict was delaying many power projects across the country. Aliyu spoke on Friday, when he received the leadership of Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) in Abuja. He announced that the Buhari administration was liaising with the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) to ensure timely completion of projects. The minister said the government had been taking an inventory of all ROW challenges for holistic approach and resolution. Aliyu hailed the EKEDC for service delivery, financial performance, and advised the management to do more on customer care and confidence. “President Muhammadu Buhari’s government is doing its best in providing the enabling environment for all segments of the electricity value chain to perform at optimum level”, he assured. “More than 100 ongoing projects by the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) will help to tackle theft and ensure grid stability,” Aliyu added. EKEDC Chairman, Dere Otubu, urged the official to continue to work towards improved power supply in Nigeria. Otubu, accompanied by the Managing Director, Fadeyibi Adeoye, charged the government to step up the fight against electricity theft.
