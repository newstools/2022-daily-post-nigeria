Lagos Police Rapid Response Squad (RRS) on Thursday arrested three traffic robbers near the Ikeja City Mall (ICM). The National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), Mile 2 park, also assisted in arresting four traffic robbers in the area. Anifowoshe Kolawole (20), Patrick Ameke (21) and John Britto (27) were picked around the mall following complaints about their illicit activities. Segun Peters (22), Kabiru Odeh (25), Nurudeen Suraj (22) and Dennis Ikuvbogie (24) were arrested at Mile 2. Acting on a tip-off, RRS Commander, CSP Olayinka Egbeyemi deployed plain cloth officers to monitor and arrest the suspects. Just last week, Suraj, who was arrested and detained at Agboju Police Station, confessed he was released from prison two months ago. “The suspects, on most occasions, pretend to be beggars and nose mask vendors. They used the ploy to rob motorists and pedestrians visiting the complex”, the RRS noted. Commissioner of Police, Abiodun Alabi commended civilians that provide intelligence to the security agency. Alabi added that communities would be safer if more people cooperated with the police.
