Prof. Pat Utomi, a political economist, has told Nigerians that the country needs a pan-Nigerian nationalist, a selfless and intellectual leader, to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. Utomi stated this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Lagos. The former presidential candidate on the platform of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) said the coalition that will change Nigeria in 2023 is already on the ground and will soon be made known to the people. He said, “Nigerians need a person of competence and compassion, someone who is very selfless and a pan-Nigerian nationalist with a track record of a life of service. “Not somebody who spends his life just thinking about himself and suddenly decides that okay, I have enough money I can now lead them. “We need a true Nigerian accepted in all parts of the country, exposed to all parts of the country in the reality of his life, not in talks and the person must have friends in every part of Nigeria. “We need a person who is interested in collegial leadership.” Utomi said that the coalition that would change Nigeria would include the youths, women and professionals. “The prospect of a coalition that will change Nigeria, which I envisage, and is being put together as we speak, is a coalition of the youth, the women, the intellectuals and the professionals,” he added. He said that some announcements about the coalition would be made soon.
