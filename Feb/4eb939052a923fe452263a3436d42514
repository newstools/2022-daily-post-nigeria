The Kano State Governor, Dr Umar Abdullahi Ganduje, has formally handed down a stern warning to Fulani herders not to get involved in cattle rustling or banditry, saying, “anybody who is caught in such destardly acts would face death penalty or life sentence”. Governor Ganduje was speaking at Kadawa Garun Mallam Local Government Area of the state, while vaccinating one million cows on the formal launch of the State-Wide Mass Cattle and Small Ruminants Vaccinations over the weekend. He said, “Since our negotiation with the Fulani herders to stop cattle rustling, Kano has seen peace and development, while government continues doing good for the herders, therefore, any move to get involved in criminalities would be faced with stiff penalty”. Ganduje reminded them that his government has done marvelously on Fulani herders in Kano, from building a whole Ruga settlement for them to keeping to annual vaccinations, therefore the herders have no reason whatsoever to be criminals. The Governor reminded them that last year they vaccinated 703,000 cattles, with 664,000 ruminants and they have not faced any infectious outbreaks, making them target one million cattle to produce healthy animals. “We have succeeded overtimes in tackling Cattles Rustling and Banditry in Kano, and anybody who mute the idea of getting involved in either rustling or Banditry would be jail for life or sentence to death without option”. He added that open grazing is today an old model and gradually is being phased out, therefore Kano has since adopted new model or Ruga settlement which would give the herders economic viability.
