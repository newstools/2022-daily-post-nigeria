Former England midfielder, Carlton Palmer believes Barcelona forward, Ousmane Dembele, will join Chelsea in the summer transfer window. Dembele was in the middle of endless transfer rumours last January’s transfer window due to his contractual situation with Barcelona. The France international has less than six months left on his current contract with Barcelona. Barcelona wanted Dembele to leave the club last month, but the player ended up staying at the Catalan club. Dembele is now keen to leave Barcelona on a free transfer at the end of the season when his contract expires. Speaking to GiveMeSport, Palmer said: “I do [see Dembele signing for Chelsea]. The Premier League is where everybody wants to play. “So, I do see that as a deal that could be done in the summer, especially with him available on a free transfer.” Dembele has played under Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, during their time together at Borussia Dortmund. Palmer added, “He’s worked with Tuchel before, Tuchel knows him, so it’s a perfect fit. I can 100 percent see that happening in the summer, especially given that he’s going to be available on a free transfer.”
