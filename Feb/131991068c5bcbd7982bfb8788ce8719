The Kano State Magistrates’ Court has adjourned the case of the murder of five-year-old Hanifa Abubakar to February 9, 2022. The prosecution counsel, led by Barr. Aisha Mahmud, said that the court lacked the jurisdiction to continue with the case and therefore requested the court to remand the four suspects in prison custody for a week before they are handed over to the state high court. The main suspect, Abdulrashid Tanko, along with three other suspects, were arraigned before the Magistrate’s Court at Gidan Murtala in Kano last Wednesday. They were accused of killing Hanifa and whose body was later discovered in early January. The case stirred a lot of controversies and caused angry youths to set the school on fire.
