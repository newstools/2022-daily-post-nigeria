The Osun State Government has disclosed its knowledge of a purported plan by some elements to impersonate officers of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) and the Nigerian Correctional Service in the state. The state government said the elements had stockpiled the uniforms of the agencies with the intent of using them during the All Progressives Congress gubernatorial primary on Saturday, February 18. This is according to a press statement signed by the Osun State Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Funke Egbemode, made available to DAILY POST in Osogbo on Thursday. The statement said, “We are in possession of an intelligence report indicating that some persons have stockpiled the uniforms of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps, NSCDC, and the Nigerian Correctional Service with an intent to distribute them to non-state actors for use during the All Progressives Congress, APC, governorship primary election in Osun State scheduled for Saturday, February 19, 2021.” While warning individuals behind the plot to jettison the idea, Egbemode revealed that security operatives have been put on the alert and mandated to deal decisively with anyone bent on causing violence and destruction in the state. The Commissioner who maintained that the state is known for peace stressed that as a responsible and responsive government, the administration of Adegboyega Oyetola is ready to take all legitimate steps to guard the enviable status jealously. She also appealed to parents and guardians to rein in their children and wards to prevent them from lending themselves as tools in the hands of persons intent on causing instability.
