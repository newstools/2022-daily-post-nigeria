Manchester United will sack interim manager, Ralf Rangnick if the club doesn’t finish in the Premier League top-four position this season. This claim was made by Arsenal legend, Paul Merson. Rangnick has come under fire in recent weeks, with Man United putting in a number of underwhelming performances – including an FA Cup defeat at Old Trafford to Middlesbrough. The German also watched as his team failed to beat Southampton in a Premier League tie on Saturday after playing a 1-1 draw. The result against Southampton means Man United are now in the 5th position on the Premier League table with 40 points from 24 matches. Speaking on Sky Sports, Merson said: “One-hundred percent [Rangnick won’t be in charge of Man Utd next season]. I have got as much chance of being in charge. I just don’t see it. “I read something that said they have improved. I don’t see that. I don’t see happiness there. I hear so much coming out of Man Utd, at the moment, which is just extraordinary. It never happened before and that is my worry. “I don’t see him being there and the way it’s going at the moment, if they don’t get in the top four, I would be shocked if he went upstairs. I know that was part of the deal, but I don’t think it is a good thing. I think this needs to be nipped in the bud sooner rather than later at Manchester United. Merson added: “I would have had someone in as soon as possible. You pay £70m to £80m for football players and some of them don’t even play. Why would you not break the bank for managers if you need to get a manager out of a club? In my opinion, they are very important.”
