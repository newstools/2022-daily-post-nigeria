The Kogi State Government has warned against indiscriminate pasting of campaign posters, display of billboards and banners of political parties, religious bodies and businesses around Lokoja, the state capital. The State Commissioner for Environment, Hon. Victor Adewale Omofaiye, who gave the warning in statement on Wednesday, said despite the fact that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was yet to lift its ban on campaigns for the 2023 elections, walls, highway roundabouts, public buildings, ongoing construction of Ganaja Junction Flyover, bridges and monuments have been defaced. Omofaiye noted that these acts are inimical to the untiring effort of the present administration of Governor Alhaji Yahaya Bello, in beautifying Lokoja Metropolis by giving it a facelift and they stand condemnable. According to him, there are procedures provided by the state government in pasting of posters, display of billboards and banners by aspirants to various political offices. He explained that the ministry is now ready to collaborate with security agencies to arrest and prosecute offenders regardless of their status in accordance with the law. The commissioner, however, warned all those concerned to desist from defacing government property in the name of campaigns with banners, posters and billboards. “The ministry is set to go all out to get rid of unapproved banners, illegal billboards and prosecute offenders at the state mobile courts as these acts are becoming worrisome to the ministry, the rate at which these posters are flying around,” he added. Omofaiye maintained that the government will for no reason shelve their responsibilities but henceforth identify all defaulters no matter how highly placed and apply necessary sanctions as may be deemed fit to serve as deterrent to others.
