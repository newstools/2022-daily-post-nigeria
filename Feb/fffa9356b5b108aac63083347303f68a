Owners of vehicles without speed limit devices in Taraba State, have been urged to, as a matter of urgency, get the devices or risk the chances of getting their vehicles impounded. The state Commandant of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Selina Williams, said the corps has concluded arrangements to impound such vehicles, as well as vehicles still using old number plates. She made the disclosure on Saturday at an interactive session with media practitioners, in Jalingo, the state capital. The decision to impound such vehicles, she said, has become imperative following an upsurge in the rate of road crashes which she believed are caused by over-speeding. The corps, according to her, has concluded plans to clampdown on all vehicles without speed limit devices and old number plates in order to mitigate road accidents. “We will also impound vehicles which indulge in overloading and other traffic offenses so as to reduce the rate of road crashes in our dear state,” she said. She also admonished motorists in the state to endeavor to go online to obtain the speed limit devices in order to avoid the wrath of the law from catching up with them.
