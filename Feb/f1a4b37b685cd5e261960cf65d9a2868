Exactly three years ago, a chopper carrying the Vice-President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, and other top political officials crashed landed in Kabba, Kogi State. The crash, which would have claimed the lives of the politicians, occurred on February 2 when the VP was travelling for the 2019 election campaign. Osinbajo, while reacting to the unfortunate incident, had in 2019, said the day could have been tagged ‘day of sorrow’ if the incident claimed their lives. “It would have been remembered as a day of sorrow because of the helicopter crash on February 2, 2019, involving me and eleven others. “But I am happy and we thank God that it turned out to be a day of victory and thanksgiving,” the VP said. Being a campaign season, some politicians, particularly members of opposition parties celebrated the incident, alleging that it was punishment for the maladministration of President Muhammadu Buhari’s government. Remembering the incident on Wednesday, Osinbajo through his spokesman, Laolu Akande, thanked God for his life, urging Nigerians to praise God who saved them from death. Akande, in a tweet on Wednesday, said, “Blessed be the name of the LORD! Today it’s exactly 3 years that GOD delivered the VP & 11 of us in Kogi when that chopper crash-landed! Join us to praise GOD, who saved us for His own glory & who is able to do exceedingly, abundantly more than we can ask or even imagine! THANKFUL”
