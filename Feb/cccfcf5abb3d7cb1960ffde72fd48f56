The founder of Salvation Ministry, David Ibiyeomie, has declared that those professing love to others without backing it with giving of money and other valuables are not genuine lovers. Speaking during a programme organized by the church to mark the 2022 Valentine’s Day, the clergy opined that all genuine loves involving giving and sacrifices. Relating his claim to offering and tithes in the church, Pastor Ibiyeomie argued that those who struggle to give money to the church, do not love God. The renowned clergy who claimed that he is a chronic lover and giver, revealed that he spent over N400 billion on charity in 2021, stressing that 80 per cent of his income goes for charity. He said, “Any love that doesn’t involve giving is fake. If anybody ever told you “I love you” and cannot give you something, cancel that love. It is not a genuine love. The best way to prove love is giving. “If someone says I love you but struggles to give you something, not only money but his or her time, it is a sign that the person doesn’t love you. Someone who cannot go extra miles with you, does not love you. “Every love has giving involved. Anyone who struggles to give God money does not live him. Everybody why criticize men of God for preaching giving is stingy. “I spent over N400b on charity las year from my own money not church account to train people I don’t know. I spend 80% of my money I’m giving”.
