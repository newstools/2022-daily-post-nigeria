Properties worth millions of niara were on Wednesday destroyed by fire in Ibaa community, Emohua Local Government Area of Rivers State. Although no life was lost in the inferno, buildings and other properties around the area were razed by the fire suspected to have come from a truck conveying illegally refined petroleum product. One of the victims of the fire incident, Ikpendu Somba said he lost all his lock-up shops to the fire. Somba threatened that those behind the act “must be ready to pay for the damage caused in the community”. The spokesman for Emohua Local Government Vigilante Service in Ibaa Community, Ohaka Obisike said the Divisional Police Officer in charge of Rumuji station has visited the scene with his men to ascertain the level of damage. This comes amid a clampdown on operators of illegal refineries in Rivers State by the state government. The fight has, however, been criticised by some persons who said illegal refining of products in parts of the state has continued.
