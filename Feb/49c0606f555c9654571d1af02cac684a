Al Hilal striker, Odion Ighalo, has said he does not have any regrets about leaving Manchester United. Ighalo played for a year at Old Trafford across two loan deals. During his spell with United, the 32-year-old netted five times for the Red Devils. In doing this, Ighalo became the first Nigerian footballer to play for Manchester United, even taking a pay cut to move to the club he’d supported since childhood. “The atmosphere in Old Trafford is different. It is a big club. If you’re not inside, you don’t know how big the club is. It is a massive, massive, massive club. “So, I thank God I played for the biggest club in the world, it’s an achievement for me and when you say, “what I should do better?”. I think I did everything I should do. I worked hard, I scored a few goals and I’m happy. “I don’t have one regret, I have zero regrets for my time at Manchester United. They are still my team till today and I’m going to support that team to death. “Even when they are struggling, I will still support them because it is Red Devils all the way,” Ighalo told ESPN.
