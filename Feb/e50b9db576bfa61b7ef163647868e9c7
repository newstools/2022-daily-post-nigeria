Hearing in the Fundamental Human Rights suit by the former Governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha, against the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, was stalled at the Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt on Monday. This follows a fresh application by the anti-graft agency. The court had on February 8 adjourned the process in the suit brought by Okorocha till Feb. 14, 2022 for hearing on grounds of late service of processes on the respondent, EFCC. When the case resumed on Monday, EFCC through its counsel, G.K. Latona, approached the court with a fresh motion on notice, praying the court for substitution of their document earlier filed and to withdraw an earlier motion on notice had filed to replace it with a new one While counsel to Okorocha, Ola Olanipekun, opposed the application, saying the fresh motion on notice has stalled the hearing of the main suit which is against the earlier judgment against the commission, Latona however stated that the EFCC was not going contrary to the judgment of court. He noted that there was no fundamental point to prove the claims of contempt. The trial Judge, Justice, Stephen Pam, after listening to the arguments, said judgment of the court which ordered the EFCC to release the travel document of Okorocha and a stop to further investigation against him still subsists. He thereafter adjourned till April 4 for hearing.
