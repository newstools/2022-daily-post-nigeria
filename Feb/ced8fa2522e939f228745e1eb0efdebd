Liverpool forward, Sadio Mane was not happy with manager Jurgen Klopp’s decision to substitute him during the Reds’ Carabao Cup final victory against Chelsea on Sunday. This claim was made by Manchester United legend, Gary Neville. Liverpool defeated Chelsea 11-10 on penalties in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley Stadium. The match ended 0-0 draw after 120 minutes as both teams failed to score. The penalty shootout went with a perfect scoreline before Kepa Arrizabalaga missed his effort. But during regulation time, in an effort to win the match, Klopp brought on substitutes in the 80th minute. Harvey Elliott, James Milner and Diogo Jota came on for Jordan Henderson, Naby Keita and Sadio Mane respectively, but Neville felt that Mane was not happy with the substitution. Neville said on Sky Sports: “Mane’s off. A little bit (surprised). I thought he would take Diaz off purely because I thought he would leave Mane and Salah on the pitch, not because Diaz deserves to go off. “He has been fantastic. But he has made that decision. I mean, he is not very happy, Mane. He has just snatched his jacket.”
