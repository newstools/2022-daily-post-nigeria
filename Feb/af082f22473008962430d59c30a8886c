Chelsea goalkeeper, Kepa Arrizabalaga, feels he deserves a starting spot in the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool, according to the UK Sun. Arrizabalaga faces competition from Edouard Mendy for Sunday’s game at Wembley. Manager Thomas Tuchel is facing a tough call on who to give the nod to for the crucial encounter. But Arrizabalaga feels Tuchel ‘owes’ him after benching him for their Club World Cup final win over Palmeiras earlier this month. The Spaniard played in the semi-final but was dropped for the final with Mendy preferred after returning from the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. Arrizabalaga has played in every round of Chelsea’s route to Wembley so far, but Tuchel insists Mendy is his first choice, having impressed in the Premier League and the Champions League this season. Should Tuchel snub the 27-year-old, it could push him closer towards the exit door in the summer as he seeks more playing time.
