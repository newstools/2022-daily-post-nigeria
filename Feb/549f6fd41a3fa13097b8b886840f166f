The Nasarawa State Police Command has recovered the corpse of one Mrs Grace Dauda, a 44-year-old employee of Federal Medical Centre, Jabi, FCT, Abuja. A statement issued and made available to DAILY POST on Wednesday by the Nasarawa State Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Ramham Nansel, said the corpse was recovered in the victim’s apartment near Goshen City along Abuja-Keffi road. According to the statement, the state’s Commissioner of Police, CP Adesina Soyemi had ordered an investigation into the matter to uncover facts that led to Dauda’s murder. The commissioner assured that the command would do everything possible to ensure that the perpetrators of the act are arrested and brought to book without delay. The statement reads in part, “The deceased body was discovered after some of her colleagues reported at Goshen City Divisional Police Headquarters at about 1900hrs; that on the same date, the deceased was not seen at work and all her phones were switched off. “Worried about her absence from work without any information, they decided to check her; only to find her lifeless body on the Couch with a deep cut on her forehead. “Upon receipt of the complaint, the Police operatives attached to Goshen City Division immediately visited the scene where preliminary investigation was conducted and the corpse removed to the mortuary for post mortem examination. “Consequently, the neighbors of the deceased and the security guard of the apartments were invited for questioning. Two of the neighbors were granted administrative bail since there is no evidence connecting them with the commission of the offence while the security guard is still in custody and assisting with the investigation”.
