The Kwara State Operations Controller, Department of Petroleum Resources, DPR, Alhaji Aminu Musa Bala, has blamed fuel dealers for the scarcity being experienced currently in the state. DAILY POST reports that long queues resurfaced in majority of the fuel stations in Ilorin the state capital since last week. While major fuel marketers remain without supply, Bovas petrol stations have come to the rescue of motorists and other fuel users. Alhaji Aminu disclosed at a meeting with the Kwara State Commissioner of Business Innovation and Enterprise, Hajia Arinola Lawal, in Ilorin that “fuel dealers were only hoarding the products for their own selfish gains.” Our Correspondent also reports that most independent marketers who had supplies prefer to hoard and sell at higher prices to motorists. Some motorists lamented that they buy fuel in some places at N250 per litre instead of N165 pr N162 per litre, forcing them to increase transport fares in the state capital. At the meeting, the commissioner ordered the DPR to expose the dealers behind the scarcity of fuel in the state. She said the state government was not happy with the long queues at filling stations and the panic created by fuel scarcity in the state. She charged the DPR to unveil the dealers hoarding the products thereby causing panic buying and unnecessary hardship to motorists and the people generally. The commissioner emphasized the commitment of the present administration in ensuring a conducive and meaningful life for Kwarans, to enable them benefit from the dividends of democracy. Hajia Arinola Lawal, also called for stronger synergy between the state government and the DPR in monitoring the supply of petroleum products to motorists and other users. She also urged the DPR to check the outright increase in the price of gas in the bid to encourage citizens to utilise cooking gas and avoid deforestation or bush burning in the state through the use of charcoal.
