Senator Shehu Sani, who represented Kaduna Central at the 8th National Assembly, has said villagers in some parts of Kaduna and Niger states are recording successes in the war against banditry. In a post on his verified Twitter handle, the former lawmaker said one of the villagers told him that their major secret is to identify informants of the assailants and crush them. According to the Kaduna State governorship aspirant, residents of both states are teaming up against the criminal elements who have continued to kill and kidnap unsuspecting citizens. The tweet reads, “Some villages in Niger and Kaduna states have organised themselves to defend their ancestral lands against terrorists, and they are achieving success with the help of the military. “I asked one of them the secret, and he replied “identifying and crushing the terrorist informants”. DAILY POST reports that parts of Kaduna and Niger states have witnessed several attacks recently, following the activities of the bloodthirsty armed bandits.
