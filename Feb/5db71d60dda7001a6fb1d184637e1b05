An Igbo socio-cultural organization, Nzuko Ndigbo, has berated a former Vice President of Nigeria and chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, on his recent position on zoning ahead of 2023 presidential election in the country. Recall that Atiku had posited that zoning of the presidential ticket was not enshrined in the 1999 constitution as amended. Reacting, Nzuko Ndigbo, in a statement by the Converner, Mazi Chuks Ibegbu and made available to DAILY POST on Monday, disagreed with Atiku on the assertion and advised the former Presidential Candidate of the PDP to respect zoning whether in the constitution or not. The group also warned in clear terms against an action capable of planting bad blood in the polity politically. The umbrella body also called for total reform in the nation’s electoral, police and political governance, as well as moral and judiciary reform in Nigeria. Also miffed by the degeneration of many departments of life in Nigeria, the Nzuko Ndigbo called for moral revolution in the country, and further noted that Nigeria is not what it is supposed to be presently, and attributed it, to leadership and followership degeneration at all levels. The group further called on the leaders and followers in Nigeria to live up to expectations in order to provide dividends of democracy to the doorsteps of the people. “We admonish patriotic and well-meaning Nigerians to give maximum support to the present political leaders in the country”, Nzuko Ndigbo advised.
