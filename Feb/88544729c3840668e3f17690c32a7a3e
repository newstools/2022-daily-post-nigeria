At least 25 terrorists fleeing Nigerian military airstrikes drowned in a river within the Marte axis in Lake Chad. Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fighter jets, including Super Tucano, shelled a number of Islamic State of West African Province (ISWAP) camps. Areas including Bukar Mairam and Jubularam, Abbaganaram and Chikul Gudu were bombarded. An intelligence operative told PRNigeria that the air unit targeted ISWAP warehouses containing several arms and ammunition. “Those who survived the blast at Bukar Mairam and Jubularam attempted to cross a river within Lake Chad. They got drowned”, the officer said. Operation Hadin Kai is sustaining air offensives as part of the strategy to foil ISWAP attacks on military formations in the North-East.
