Arsenal legend, Paul Merson, believes Leicester City’s Brendan Rodgers is the best coach to coach Manchester United ahead of Paris Saint-Germain’s Mauricio Pochettino. Pochettino is said to be the leading contender to replace interim manager Ralf Rangnick at Man United. But Merson wants Manchester United not to hire Pochettino this summer, adding that they should pursue Rodgers instead. “I don’t understand why Manchester United would be waiting for Mauricio Pochettino. I don’t get it. If Pochettino does not win the Champions League with Paris Saint-Germain, why would they be going in for him? “You have got to remember he failed to win the French league last year, too. That is virtually impossible to do. Everybody keeps saying they need to go out and get Pochettino, but I don’t understand why. “It does my head in. It’s all I ever hear. What did he do? He got Tottenham [Hotspur] to the final of the Champions League and his side finished third one year in the Premier League. “Football is all about timing. If Leicester were second in the Premier League right now and still in the cups, Brendan Rodgers would be the bookmakers’ favourite to be the next manager of Man Utd. “If I was in charge at United, I would be going for Rodgers or Graham Potter now. People are still caught up on the Pochettino of seven years ago. “He took Tottenham as far as he could, and then you have got someone like Rodgers who has done a far better job than what Pochettino did,” Merson told Sky Sports.
