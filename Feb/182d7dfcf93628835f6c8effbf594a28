Interested parties are said to be on “high alert” over the possible sale of Chelsea, according to Bloomberg. This week, Labour MP Chris Bryant, used parliamentary privilege to question Roman Abramovich’s ownership of the Premier League club. This followed Russian president Vladimir Putin’s decision to launch a military invasion of Ukraine earlier this week. It is now understood that potential suitors – including some based in the US – have begun drawing up takeover bids amid the uncertainty. These alleged individuals interested in buying Chelsea remain anonymous. Abramovich took over as the Blues owner in 2003 and has invested heavily in the club, overseeing the most successful era in their history. During the last two decades, Chelsea have won countless trophies – including five Premier League titles and the Champions League twice.
