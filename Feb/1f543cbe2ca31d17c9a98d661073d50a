At least, three suspects have been arrested in connection with the burning of 2,420 hectares of farmland belonging to former president, Olusegun Obasanjo. DAILY POST had reported that hoodlums, on Saturday, set fire on the Obasanjo’s mango farmland situated at the Howe community in Gwer East Local Government Area of Benue State. Governor Samuel Ortom, who gave the update on Thursday during a Thanksgiving service held at Chapel of Grace, Benue Peoples House Makurdi to mark the 46th anniversary of the state’s creation, said, four suspects have been arrested, while three are still being trailed by security agents. Ortom stated that the Benue State government will visit the farm to assess the extent of damage caused by the inferno and see what it could do in the interim. He expressed happiness that the former president is not contemplating to relocate the farm despite the huge loss this has caused him. While looking back at the state since it was created in 1976, the governor declared that only God deserves praise and thanksgiving for preserving Benue. The governor stated that Benue has passed through several challenges, some meant to encourage the state, stressing that many leaders have come and gone but the people are grateful because God is still in charge. Recounting his experiences in the last six years, the governor expressed confidence that the end of his tenure will surely be better than when he started. He pointed out that the provision of roads with asphalt in Makurdi and other major towns in the state is part of his efforts to end strong. The governor, while tasking Benue people on obedience to God as well as adherence to justice, equity and fairness, said his desire is for God to anoint his successor who will surpass his performance.
