Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun State has commended party members for exemplifying the peaceful demeanor the state is known for. He said this at Boripe Ward 1, St Peter’s Primary School, Olotin, Iragbiji. Appealing to citizens across the state to maintain peace and decorum as elections should not be a battle, he remarked that Osun being the most peaceful state in the country, the insinuations of violence making the rounds were mere speculations. “I want to appeal to all our people across the State to maintain peace. Election process should not be a battlefield or a do-or-die affair. Let everyone exercise his/her choice in determining who represents them at the Party level and ultimately at the general elections. “So far so good, I think this process has gone well contrary to the speculation of violence. We have been in contact with a number of places and we have received positive signals of peace. “Really, I don’t see why choosing a candidate to represent the Party should bring violence,” he said. Oyetola also expressed confidence that he will emerge victorious in the primary election. This is as he added that losing was not an option for a man commissioned by God for an assignment.
