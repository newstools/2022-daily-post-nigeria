Some yet-to-be identified gunmen have attacked the residence of Mr Abdurrahman Adamu, Chairman of the Federal University of Gusau chapter, Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU. DAILY POST learnt that the incident, which occurred on Wednesday morning, led to the abduction of at least six persons, including Adamu’s neighbour.

The ASUU leader, who confirmed the incident to Channels Television, revealed that his younger brother, a niece, a nephew, and younger sisters of his two wives were all abducted during the incident.
