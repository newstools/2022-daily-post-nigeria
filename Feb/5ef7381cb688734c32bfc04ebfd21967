Kaduna-born politician Shehu Sani has said the just-concluded FCT council election shows that voter apathy still exists. Sani on his Twitter page alleged that politicians bribed people to vote for them in most parts of Abuja. He said some voters justified their reasons for collecting money to vote. He wrote, ”The Abuja Local council elections demonstrated that nothing much has changed, Electorates were paid to vote and voter apathy in most places. ”One voter told me “Party exco collect money, politicians collect money so we the voters must collect money.” Meanwhile, the PDP has won the Chairmanship for Kuje and Bwari Area councils. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Sunday declared Shekwogaza John Gabaya, of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Bwari Council and Suleman Sabo of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for Kuje Council winners of the Saturday election.
