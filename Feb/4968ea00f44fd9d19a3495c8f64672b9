Hundreds of Nigerian students, on Monday, took to the streets in Kano to protest the ongoing Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) strike. The students, who commenced their protests from Kofar Nassarawa Kano to the Emir’s palace, kicked against the continued strike, describing it as anti-education. They lamented that many of their colleagues have become drug addicts while some have become criminals. Responding, the Emir of Kano, who received the students, said it is disheartening that the students are left idle. He said he has spoken to both the Federal Government and the ASUU and advised them to resolve the matter amicably. “I will send an emissary right away to get first hand information on what is happening now and I will do whatever it’s takes to make them see sense in resolving the matter”, the Emir assured.
