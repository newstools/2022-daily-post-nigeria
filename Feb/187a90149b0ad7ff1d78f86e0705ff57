A 43-year-old man, Ademola Oladimeji, has been remanded by an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court for allegedly defiling his three daughters. The police arraigned Oladimeji, a resident of Fadeyi, Lagos State, on a two-count charge of defilement and assault. The Prosecution Counsel, DSP Kehinde Ajayi, told the court that Oladimeji committed the offence sometime in 2021, in his residence at Fadeyi. She said that the mother of the girls had reported that the accused had been defiling their daughters aged nine, seven, and five by allegedly inserting his finger into their private part, NAN reports. She mentioned that when the girls’ mother found out, she confronted her husband and was angry, leading to beatings and injuries inflicted on her body. According to Section 137 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2005, defilement attracts life imprisonment. In the ruling, the Magistrate, A.O. Ajibade, who refused to take Oladimeji’s plea, directed the police to send the case file to the state Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for advice. She adjourned the case until March 2 for the DPP’s advice and directed the suspect be remanded in Kirikiri Correctional Centre.
