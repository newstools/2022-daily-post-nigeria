The Leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, on Saturday, revealed that Nigeria’s next president would not be up to 70 years old. Primate Ayodele disclosed that Nigeria’s next president would have a better administration than his predecessors. He, however, warned the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) against employing rotational technique in deciding Nigeria’s next president. In a statement signed by his Media Aide, Osho Oluwatosin, Primate Ayodele revealed that God is not in support of rotation or zoning to decide the next president of Nigeria. He disclosed that zoning or rotation would lead Nigeria into more crises than ever. The clergyman made it known that the parties should allow aspirants, no matter their numbers, to contest for the position and allow the people vote for their choice instead of invalidating them through rotation. Primate Ayodele revealed that he will give a clearer description when God reveals. “Rotation or no rotation is not the issue now, the next president of Nigeria will not be up to 70 years. “The next president will have a better administration than the previous ones, but the parties should not make a mistake of using rotation to decide. “God is not in support of it, they should allow as many as possible aspirants contest and allow the people to choose. “Parties should be after getting the right candidates, not by rotation. Rotation will put an incompetent person and lead to another crisis for four years. Let the parties pick the right candidate.”
