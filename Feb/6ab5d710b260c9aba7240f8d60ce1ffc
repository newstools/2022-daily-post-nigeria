Niger State lawmakers have confirmed the appointment of Abubakar Musa Mohammed Kigera, as the substantive Grand Khadi of Shari’a Court of Appeal of the State. The confirmation of the Grand Khadi would have been done a week earlier but an objection and a motion moved by Bello Ahmed, a member representing Agwara constituency staled it. When the Speaker, Bawa Wuse read the letter from the State Governor, Abubakar Sani Abubakar to the House seeking their approval for the appointment of the new Grand Khadi, Ahmed raised an objection and requested that the nominee be asked to appear before the Assembly in case members had questions to ask. However, the nominee appeared before the House and scaled through the screening and was confirmed the substantive Grand Khadi by the House. The motion for Kigera’s confirmation was moved by Mohammed Abba Bala, member representing Borgu Constituency and seconded by Malik Madaki Bosso, lawmaker representing Bosso Constituency to confirm the nominee as the new Grand Khadi. The new Grand Khadi was born on 3 September 1971 and hails from Borgu Local Government Area. Kigera holds a Degree in Law (LL.B), Diploma in Shari’a and Civil Law and Diploma in Arabic Language Education.
