Ondo State Government has expressed dismay over the abuse on the usage of number plates of the National Association of Nigerian Students, NANS, National Youths Council of Nigeria, NYCN, and Nigerian Youth Parliament, NYP, among others by some car owners in the state While vowing to go tough on those using such number plates, the state government stated that criminals have began to use them to commit crimes. A statement issued over the weekend by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Transport, Tobi Ogunleye, said government will no longer tolerate customised number plates of vehicles across the state without the necessary document backing it. Ogunleye added that anyone caught will be made to face the full wrath of the law as security agencies had been mandated to take action as regards the development. The statement partly read, “The Ondo State Government has noted with dismay the practice of some persons adopting special/customised number plates, most of which have the inscription of the presidency. These numbers include, but are not limited to, NANS, NYCN, NYP and others. “While residents have the right to modify their license number plates, it is becoming clear that criminals have begun to use this as a means of carrying out their illicit activities in the state.”
