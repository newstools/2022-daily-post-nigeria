Former Manchester United midfielder, Paul Scholes, has said Bruno Fernandes is becoming “a problem” at the club, following a 1-1 draw with Southampton on Saturday. The Red Devils again failed to win despite scoring in the first half for the third successive match. Jadon Sancho’s goal was cancelled out by Che Adams at Old Trafford. Scholes highlighted Fernandes as an issue within the structure of the team. “I think Fernandes could be a little bit of a problem, you know. “As much as he’s such a talented lad – when he first came to the club he scored so many great goals, so many assists – but he’s all over the football pitch. “You see Fernandes, sometimes he’s left-back, he’s right-back, at the end of the game he was playing behind Dalot for five minutes!” Scholes said on BT Sport.
