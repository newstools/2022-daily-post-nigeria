Nigerian music artist, Mohbad has alleged that his label boss, Naira Marley and other members of his record label are after his life. Mohbad said this in an Instagram live video after his release from the NDLEA custody for being in possession of Cannabis and Molly. He said: “I don’t know why these people have been hating on me, they have been doing bad bad things on me, I went mad because of this issue now they are trying to kill me.” “Everybody in the whole world please help me, if I die, just know it was Marlian Music and Naira Marley that killed me,” he said. Some minutes after, reports from another live Instagram video showed Mohbad going to a hospital. He was heard crying out, “God please help me, I don’t trust anybody please help me, I don’t want to die.” The reason for his outburst and behavior is yet to be disclosed, but this comes after the artist and his colleague, Zinolesky were arrested by NDLEA officers on Thursday. Some fans have opined that he might be traumatized from his experience at the NDLEA custody or may be suffering withdrawal symptoms from drugs. However, Naira Marley, who confirmed he’s on his way to Nigeria, described NDLEA’s treatment of his boys, Zinolesky and Mohbad as ‘disgusting and unfair’. A babe is behind Mohbad crying and he’s mentioning names of people in Marlian Music that are after his life, he mentioned Zino and the entire label except “19”, I just pray he’s okay, this looks serious . pic.twitter.com/SS0rr9Pgu0 — OTUNBA 🇨🇦 (@ManLikeIcey) February 24, 2022
