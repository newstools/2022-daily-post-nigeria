Chelsea legend, Didier Drogba has made some honest comments about the club’s point man, Romelu Lukaku, saying the Belgian will ‘come good’ at Stamford Bridge. The Ivorian believes Lukaku’s goals in the Club World Cup final can kick-start his season. The Belgium international has not met the expectations of a large number of Chelsea fans following a £97.5m move from Inter Milan last summer. He has scored just five goals in 16 Premier League appearances, with injury and off-field issues affecting his form. “He took his responsibility to talk and put a bit more pressure on himself and delivered tonight, scoring an important goal,” Drogba told reporters when asked about Lukaku after the Club World Cup victory. “Obviously, every player always has something to prove and will always want to do better but he’s there, big game, he scored the goal to give us the lead. It’s good to see that his mentality is being positive. “He’s a goalscorer, he has done that before and he’s having a difficult moment, but bouncing back this kind of trophy will bring his confidence back. “I think he will [come good]. He put himself under a certain pressure because coming back to the club where your start was difficult and you come back because you want to prove a point, but he’s winning and I think he’s going to make it.” The former Manchester United, Everton and Inter Milan striker recently got into trouble after he granted a controversial interview to Sky Sports Italia. The striker in the interview criticised his manager, Thomas Tuchel, saying the German’s formation does not go well with him. Lukaku said he never wanted to return to Chelsea and had three other clubs in mind. He said he would want to leave Chelsea for Inter Milan soon, prompting him o be suspended for a game by Tuchel but apologised afterwards.
