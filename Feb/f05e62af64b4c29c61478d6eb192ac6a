The presidency says the introduction of the Treasury Single Account (TSA) has reduced corruption in the country by 80-90 percent. At the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Forum, Director-General, Bureau of Public Service Reforms (BPSR), Dasuki Arabi, said the implementation was initially difficult for citizens to accept. The official noted that TSA had impacted positively on the economy and in the fight against corruption in public services. “If you are importing goods worth N1 billion and you are not smuggling them, you must pay duties. “You can’t pay duties with cash, it must be paid online to the TSA. I think it has reduced abuses by more than 80 per cent, if not 90 per cent.” Arabi recalled there were problems with some agencies at the early stage because some ran their services based on what they generated. He confirmed that the government’s digitization process made it possible to track goods coming into Nigeria. Citing an instance, Arabi said for any container coming in from China, the bill of lading and other documents are electronically transmitted to Nigeria. The Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS), Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Nigerian Port Authority (NPA) and Shippers Council are involved in the monitoring, the DG added. “I am confident that it has reduced corruption by more than 80 to 90 per cent. “You pay for all your things online. It will be difficult for anybody to convince you to get one or two kobo out of it, “ he said.
