Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has debunked news of his purported plan to announce his presidential bid ahead of the 2023 elections after the All Progressives Congress, APC, convention. Reports had emerged online on Monday that Osinbajo would announce his intention to run for 2023 presidency soon. However, Osinbajo through his spokesman, Laolu Akande, clarified that the report making the rounds is false and speculative snippets. He added that any information on the action of the Vice President will come directly from his office and not press. Laolu made this known in a tweet on Monday. The tweet read: “I’ve seen “news” that VP’ll announce presidential bid after APC’s convention. Anyone reading the story ‘ll know it’s all false and speculative snippets. “ Any information on activities and actions of the VP will come directly from his office and not sponsored speculations in the press.”
