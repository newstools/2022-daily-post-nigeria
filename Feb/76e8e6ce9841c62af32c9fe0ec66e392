A Special Adviser to the governor of Taraba State, Arc. Darius Dickson Ishaku, Levi Gbashi, has been killed by unknown gunmen. The incident reportedly occurred on Saturday while he was on his way to attend a burial ceremony in Donga Local Government Council of the State. Confirming the incident, the chairman of the Council, Nashuka Ipeyen, said he has drawn the attention of security operatives to the incident. Special forces, according to him, have been deployed to the area in order to ensure normalcy. He said, “it is unfortunate that the incident happened”, adding that “as I speak with you, the commander of the Special forces has deployed his men to the area.” He said soldiers and other security operatives “are currently combing the bushes searching for his corpse.” The incident, according to an eyewitness, occurred at Ityopaa village, when the late SA was at the verge of leaving for a burial ceremony in Donga. The eyewitness, who gave his name as Tortsua Naagh, said both of them were to attend the burial when the unknown gunmen came calling. He said “we were leaving for the venue of the burial on a motorcycle when some young men stopped us and ordered us to kneel.” While the eyewitness who was traveling with the late SA, was spared, the reverse was the case with Gbashi, who he said was not only killed but his corpse was made away with by the hoodlums. Other persons from the Council, who spoke with DAILY POST, stressed the need for the deployment of more troops to the area, which they described as a den of hoodlums. As of the time of filing this report, the leadership of the State Police Command could not be reached for more details.
