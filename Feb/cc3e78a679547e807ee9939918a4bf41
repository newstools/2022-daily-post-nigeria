Frank Lampard has explained his reason for appointing former teammate, Ashley Cole as his assistant at Everton. Lampard said, Cole, a former Chelsea teammate, will bring a ‘wealth of enthusiasm and game-play experience’ to Everton. Lampard added Cole to his backroom staff after his appointment as Everton boss. Cole, who won three Premier League titles and the Champions League, joins Everton as first-team coach from Chelsea academy. “He is now a well-respected coach which has been recognised by his work with England Under-21s. “He’ll bring a wealth of enthusiasm, game-play experience and is a very good young coach who adds strength to our coaching staff,” Lampard told reporters.
