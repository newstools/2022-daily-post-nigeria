The Rivers State Command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps has paraded 19 suspected dealers of illegal oil bunkering activities arrested in different parts of the state. The NSCDC Command in the state also displayed trucks, speed boats and other vehicles recovered by their men from different illegal oil bunkering sites. The state Commandant of the NSCDC, Abu Tambuwalm, who paraded the suspects in Port Harcourt on Monday, said the command also “discovered over 50 illegally refined petroleum sites, 400 drums of petroleum product suspected to be illegally refined in the course of joint operations. The Commandant added that the command under his watch has resolved to take “the war against illegal oil refinery to all parts of the state”, saying those arrested will be charged to court at the end of investigation. He also commended Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, for assisting the command in the fight by delegating the local government authorities to join in the fight. He also called for more synergy with other stakeholders in order to win the fight. Some of suspects, who spoke to journalists at the command headquarters, however, denied involvement in the illegal oil bunkering activities, claiming that they were arrested in their apartment and brought to the command.
