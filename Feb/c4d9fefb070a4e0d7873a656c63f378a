Arsenal legend, Ian Wright, has said only a change of position can rescue Nicolas Pepe’s career at the club. Pepe has failed to live up to expectations since the club-record £72million transfer in 2019 from Lille. The 26-year-old has lost his place in Mikel Arteta’s team to Bukayo Saka, Emile Smith Rowe and Gabriel Martinelli. Pepe has only made five starts in the top flight this campaign and his best performances came in the Carabao Cup, where he grabbed two goals and four assists in three appearances. The Ivorian usually plays on the right-wing, allowing him to cut inside onto his stronger left foot. But Wright believes a positional shake-up is required. He told his Wrighty’s House podcast: “Up to this point he’s (Arteta’s) not used Pepe in any way that makes me think he’s got love for Pepe. “I’d like to see something from him. When you watch him in the AFCON, where I think the defender is even harder with those guys, with how athletic, how good and how intelligent they are. “You’ve got to do a lot more, and when you watch him, he’s done it Why aren’t we getting that out of him? “If that means playing him in a false-nine, or playing him in a position where he’s just free and gets on the ball and runs at people.”
