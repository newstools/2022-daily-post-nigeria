Former Liverpool player, Mark Lawrenson has predicted the outcome of the Premier League match-day 24 games. Burnley will take on Manchester United at Turf Moor on Wednesday night, while Newcastle United will clash with Everton. Wolves will host Arsenal on Thursday night, while Liverpool will tackle Leicester City. Providing his predictions, Lawrenson told BBC Sport: “Newcastle need the three points more than Everton do, but I don’t think they will get them. Newcastle 1, Everton 1.” Commenting on the Burnley vs Man United tie, Lawrenson said, “United should still beat Burnley – who are bottom of the table with only one win all season. If they don’t, it will probably be for the reasons we have seen already. Burnley 0, Man United 2.” Speaking on the Liverpool vs Leicester game, Lawrenson said, “Leicester beat Liverpool after Christmas but they had a fit and firing Jamie Vardy then. Without him, and with the way the Foxes are defending right now, I don’t see a repeat of that result. 3, Leicester 0.” On the Wolves vs Arsenal match, Lawrenson said, “Bruno Lage’s side are very good defensively and that means they can put in a pretty average performance going forward but still have a chance of winning games because they are so solid. “They have conceded only 16 in 21 league games so far and I don’t think Arsenal will break them down either. Wolves 2, Arsenal 0.”
