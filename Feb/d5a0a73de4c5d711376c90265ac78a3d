A Federal High Court sitting in Abeokuta has ruled over a matter involving the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State and a suspended member of the party, Samson Bamgbose. DAILY POST reports that the party in Ogun State had in 2020 suspended Bamgbose over alleged anti-party activities. Not satisfied, Bamgbose approached the Federal High Court, demanding that his suspension be declared null and void. He demanded to be returned as the Chairman of the party in Ogun State after he was removed by the Kashamu faction that earlier elected him as one. But, the defendants had sought the dismissal of the application based on lack of jurisdiction. Delivering judgement in suit no. FHC/AB/CS/112/2020, Justice J.O. Abdulmaliq, ruled against Bamgbose Samson and others plaintiffs. The judge admitted lack of jurisdiction and locus standi to adjudicate over the matter and the suit was dismissed. Meanwhile, a chieftain of the party, Olumide Aderinokun, has described the ruling as a “victory for all in Ogun PDP.” The Ogun Central senatorial aspirant called on all aggrieved members of the party to come together and make the PDP one indivisible entity. Aderinokun maintained that the judgement has “upheld Hon. Sikirulai Ogundele as the duly elected Chairman of the PDP in the state.” He commended the judiciary for the judgement, which he said signifies the constitution of the party. “It is pertinent to note the efforts that the party leadership is making for reconciliation in Ogun State. “The judgement is a victory for all members and also an extension of the olive branch to members who are trying to create factions in the party to come under one umbrella of our chairman, Hon. Sikirulai Ogundele. “Definitely, with a united PDP, we will emerge stronger than before and rescue Ogun State and Nigeria in 2023,” he said.
