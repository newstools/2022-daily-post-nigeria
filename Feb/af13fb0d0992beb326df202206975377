A popular singer in northern Nigeria, Haruna Abdullahi Aliyu, has regretted singing and supporting President Muhammadu Buhari. Aliyu sang Buhari’s praises during the 2015 and 2019 general elections. However, Aliyu in a viral video, said he regrets campaigning for Buhari, adding that the president has ”failed Nigerians.” He lamented about the handling of the security challenges, especially in the north amid high cost of living. Speaking in Hausa, Aliyu said, “I deeply regret singing support songs for President Buhari because he’s failed Nigerians. He has not kept his campaign promises. “I sw*ar to God, I regret supporting Buhari on a number of issues badly handled by his administration. Of course, one may not regret everything but I regret anyway. “I regret because we supported him based on his assurances that he was capable of tackling insecurity, corruption and bad economy, but as it is, the president has failed and hugely so. It is regrettable to have believed him this much.” The level of insecurity in the North seems to be far from over as bandits have not ceased from killing and abducting citizens. DAILY POST reported that gunmen suspected to be terrorists over the weekend attacked Nasarawa Maifara and Yarkasina villages in Tsafe and Bungudu Local Government Areas and killed about 30 persons. A villager from Nasarawa Maifara community, Idris Lawal, told DAILY POST that the bandits earlier imposed a levy on the community some weeks ago, demanding the sum of N40 million as a tax levy.
