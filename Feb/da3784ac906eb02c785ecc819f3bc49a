The All Progressives Congress, APC, Enugu State Chapter, has said it is participating in tomorrow, Wednesday’s local government election in the State. A factional chairman of the party, Barr. Ugo Agballah had claimed that the party was excluded from the election. But in a statement by Comrade Adolphus Ude-led APC, he said the party was taking part in the exercise. Ude urged members of the public to ignore Agballah as he was not speaking for the party. “I want to inform members of the public that the ENSIEC dully cleared APC candidates to participate in the election and we are taking part in the exercise. “We have said it that we are contesting in this election, both chairmanship and councillorship positions. “Ugo Agballah is not a member of the APC and as such can never speak for the party. Any statement from him should never be taken to have come from the APC. “Having said this, I urge members of our party to come all out tomorrow and vote for our candidates,” he stated.
