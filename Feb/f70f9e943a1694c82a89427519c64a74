Manchester United are set to open talks with four candidates for their vacant managerial position in the coming weeks after they finalize a shortlist of contenders. Man United will appoint a new long-term manager at the end of the season. The Red Devils had placed Ralf Rangnick in interim charge after sacking Ole Gunnar Solskjaer last November. According to The Athletic, Paris Saint-Germain coach, Mauricio Pochettino, is the leading candidate for the role. Man United have twice considered hiring Pochettino in the past, but it’s unclear whether the Argentine would be willing to leave PSG. The Premier League giants have also shortlisted Ajax’s Erik Ten Hag as a backup and the Dutchman is said to have considerable backing at Old Trafford. Rangnick is thought to be particularly keen to hire Ten Hag, believing he is a good fit for Man United due to his philosophy and ability to build young players. Others shortlisted are Luis Enrique and Julen Lopetegui, though they are someway behind Pochettino and Ten Hag in the pecking order.
