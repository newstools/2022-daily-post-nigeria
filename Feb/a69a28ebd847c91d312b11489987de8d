A two-year-old baby has been abducted at Umuobiakwa community of Obingwa Local Government Area of Abia State. Abia State Police Command’s Spokesman, SP Geoffrey Ogbonna, confirmed the abduction to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Aba on Tuesday. Ogbonna disclosed that the minor, identified as Precious Akataobi, was reportedly abducted by suspected child traffickers at her mother’s shop in Umuobiakwa over the weekend. Narrating how the incident happened, he said that the child’s mother was with her and his elder brother in the shop until she went into the compound to bring something. He said that the woman left the girl in the custody of her elder brother. Ogbonna said the command further learnt that at that point, some persons came to the shop, bought something and gave the boy N500 note to get change. He said that as soon as the boy went into the compound to get the change from their mother, the abductors fled with the baby. The Police Spokesman admonished residents of the state to help the police with credible information that could help in tracking down the baby and her abductors. He urged parents to be vigilant and guard against exposing their children to danger.
