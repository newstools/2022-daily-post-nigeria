The national president of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), Francis Wale-Oke has stated that God is raising a competent young Nigerian to lead the nation out of its current woes. The PFN President said this at the 12th Edition of the Independent Newspapers Ltd. Thanksgiving Service on Friday in Lagos. Wale-Oke urged leaders and government at all levels to do away with greed, adding that the days of old generations in government were numbered. “God is working to raise a competent President of Nigeria among younger Nigerians to digitalize the nation’s economy for the common good,” he said. “The days of social-economic challenges are numbered with the exit of older generations in governance and the advent of younger and pragmatic ones into the leadership circuit,” he added.
