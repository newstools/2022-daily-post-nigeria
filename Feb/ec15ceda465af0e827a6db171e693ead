Vehicular queues have resurfaced in some filling stations in Port Harcourt as fear of possible scarcity of petrol continues to grow. The queues are mostly in NNPC filling stations as most private fuel stations have remained closed. Some car owners expressed shock over the imminent scarcity of petrol. Others have complained of buying fuel for as much as N180 per litre in some parts of the state. Meanwhile, some car owners have confirmed buying adulterated fuel from some fillings stations in Port Harcourt which they said has affected their car engines. A source from the petroleum marketers camp in River State had earlier disclosed that only one depot in the state out of eighteen was selling petrol to marketers as of Monday. This comes one week after the Petroleum Product Retail Outlet Owners Association of Nigeria disclosed that Rivers State may soon be experiencing fuel scarcity as seen in some states of the federation.
