Over 3,000 members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the Fika Local Government Area area of Yobe State have defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state. APC Chairman-elect in the state, Mohammed Gadaka, received the new entrants into the ruling party’s fold in Fika town, an event which attracted political gladiators as well as other critical stakeholders from Yobe South. The Chairman-elect, who commended the new entrants, assured them of equal treatment. He also said APC’s doors are always open to defectors from opposition parties in the state. The former PDP members said they were attracted to join APC due to Governor Mai Mala Buni’s visionary leadership which has translated into executing people-oriented projects for the betterment of the state. Recall that, Yobe State Publicity Secretary of the PDP had in a statement claimed that more than 1,000 APC chieftains, supporters and loyalists , including the 2019 gubernatorial candidate, Dr. Aji Kolomi, shifted their loyalty to the opposition party in Damaturu after launching “Operation Flush APC In The State”.
