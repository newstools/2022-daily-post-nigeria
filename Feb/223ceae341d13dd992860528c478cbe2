President Muhammadu Buhari has stated that progress was being made in achieving the targets set out in Nigeria’s Strategy for Immunization and Primary Health Care System Strengthening. Buhari cited preliminary reports showing that coverage for the third dose of the pentavalent vaccine increased from 33 percent in 2017 to 63 percent in 2019. The President on Friday received Gavi Alliance High Level Mission to Nigeria led by Dr. Seth Berkley, Chief Executive Officer of The Gavi Alliance and members. Noting the drop to 56 percent in 2021 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Buhari added that “there is a lot more to do.’’ He assured that the government would increase funding to the Health Sector through the Basic Healthcare Provision Fund and other initiatives. “Gavi’s disbursement of a total sum of 1.5 billion dollars in grants to support immunization and health systems strengthening in Nigeria since 2001 has significant results. “Our donors and partners have played their part in providing all the necessary support to improve our health outcomes.” Buhari hailed Gavi’s approval for extension of Nigeria’s transition out of Gavi’s support, and the commitment of over $3billion to fund vaccine procurement and health system interventions nationwide. “I extend my sincere appreciation for the recent support you provided to Nigeria’s COVID-19 response efforts through the provision of 762million dollars in grants, free vaccines through the COVAX Facility as well as an additional $23million for vaccine deployment”, he added. The President assured that the government will improve work on routine immunization performance, contain outbreaks of the Circulating Vaccine-Derived Polio Virus, strengthen surveillance against Wild Polio Virus and curb the spread of COVID-19.
