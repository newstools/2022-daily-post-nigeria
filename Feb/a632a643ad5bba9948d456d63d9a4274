A presidential aspirant under the Coalition of Political Parties, CPP, Prince Adewole Adebayo, has noted that previous governments have woefully failed to address even the simplest challenges facing the country Adewole said this while addressing newsmen at the Nicon Luxury Hotel, Abuja on Tuesday, at the public presentation of a book on traditional medicine. According to him, the country can generate over $100 billion from the field of plant medicine if it pays serious attention to it. He said unfortunately, traditional medicine has been overlooked because leaders depend mostly on foreign hospitals for even the slightest ailment. He pointed out that this neglect and lack of focus to develop various sectors in the country affects every other sector in the country . Adebayo said, “What has happened to our traditional medical field is what has happened to almost every aspect. “It is the same reason we don’t have electricity, the same reason lecturers are on strike, it is the same reason we are importing fuel that we should be producing.” The presidential hopeful, however, said that he will no longer complain, because Nigerians know the situation of things already, “so, they want me to bring solutions. “The solution is that we are going to do opposite of what the government has being doing,” he maintained
