Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand, has compared Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah to Atletico Madrid’s Luis Suarez. Ferdinand believes that Salah’s exploits for Jurgen Klopp’s side this season have eclipsed Suarez’s incredible 2013-14 season at Liverpool, lifting the lid on a debate with former England striker, Michael Owen, over the pair. Salah has been in sensational form for Liverpool this season, scoring 25 goals and registering nine assists for the Merseyside club in 30 matches. Salah’s contributions have kept Liverpool firing on all fronts and his goal against Norwich City on Saturday was his 150th goal for the Anfield club since joining the Premier League giants from Roma in 2017. But Ferdinand believes Salah has moved a level above Suarez, a former Liverpool striker, when it comes to the club’s all-time best attackers, adding that the Egyptian captain needs a bit more respect. Recall that Suarez enjoyed a remarkable 2013-14 campaign at Liverpool, scoring 31 goals in 33 appearances as well as registering 17 assists for his teammates as Brendan Rodgers’ side went incredibly close to the Premier League title. “I had this argument with Michael Owen,” Ferdinand said on his Youtube channel Vibe with Five. “He said that Suarez, when he was on fire (2013/14), had a better season than Mo Salah is having this season – I disagreed. “I think Salah’s a joke. I think he’s a ridiculous player. The Chelsea goal the other day, a little shimmy, the defender was rocked. Bang, goal. ‘You know how many players he does that against. Kalidou Koulibaly [for Napoli] at Anfield, he’s meant to be a £70m-£80m player. Get off, bang, goal. ‘He’s done this consistently for years now. This guy needs a bit more respect put on Mo Salah’s name. ‘Forget my ties to Man United or whatever, Mo Salah is the truth.”
