Ahead of the forthcoming 2023 presidential election, the Former Jigawa State Governor, Sule Lamido has appealed to political stakeholders to avoid the issue of zoning as the criteria for leadership selection in the general elections. Lamido noted that with a proven track record of trustworthiness and a national outlook Tambuwal should be encouraged to join the 2023 presidential race. The former Jigawa State Governor made the call when he received Gov. Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State and his entourage in his Bamaina country home in Birnin Kudu local government area of the state on Tuesday. The visit was part of the Governor’s first leg of nationwide consultations on his presidential ambition under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. The former minister of foreign affairs lamented that all previous efforts to stabilize the nation have been bastardized in recent times following the worrisome upsurge of ethnicity and religious schisms. Lamido noted that the trends need to be reversed, pointing out that what is needed is competent leaders with sterling qualities such as Tambuwal. The statement continued “Our son here is like me. We have similar and parallel positions in government. I have even held more sensitive positions than him. “He added that he is ready to support Gov. Tambuwal if he opts to seek PDP’s ticket to be its flag bearer provided he will be a pan Nigerian that will be just. We can reach out to all Nigerians across the geographic and other divides in our bid to support him. In his remarks, former Governor of Sokoto State, Attahiru Dalhatu Bafarawa, who thanked Lamido for the warm reception, said the visit was not political but consultative. “You are not just a former Governor but a great political mobilizer whose people still respect and follow although you have been out of office for almost seven years now”.
