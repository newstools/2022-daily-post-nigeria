Veteran comic actor, Victor Osuagwu, has told the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to arrest the ‘Federal Government’, over the importation of adulterated petrol into the country. The development has resulted in long queues in filling stations across the country amid fuel scarcity. The Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority, NMDPRA, said the supply of petrol with methanol quantities above Nigeria’s specification found in the supply chain was responsible for scarcity and long queues at filling stations. Osuagwu, in a video on his Instagram page, decried the damages that Nigerians have incurred as a result of purchasing and using the adulterated fuel. He wondered who would take responsibility for the damages. Speaking in pidgin, the actor said: “It’s high time the EFCC arrested the Federal Government for the importation of ‘Wawawa’ fuel’. What did I say? “It’s not just to go about arresting people who only sprayed money or those doing business. Any kind of business you guys claim not to know the source of income you just proceed to arrest the person and question him about his source of income.” Osuagwu queried EFCC for failing to question the poor in Nigeria about how they survive but goes after Nigerians progressing in the world of business. “I’ve never seen EFCC arrest beggars on the street or those who keep knocking on your door when you’re driving and begging you for something. Why not also go and arrest and ask them, “What’s the source of your begging?
