Hon. Umar M. Bature, National Organizing Secretary of the party in a statement said the notice of resignation was to ensure a level playing field for all contestants. According to the statement, for purposes of verification, all resignation letters are to be directed to the office of the National Organizing Secretary. Failure by such aspirants to adhere to the resignation directives renders his or her contest invalid.
