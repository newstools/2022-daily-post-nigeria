The Delta State Police Command has refuted a fake Facebook account created by an individual who parades himself as CP Ari Muhammed Ali. The Command said CP Ari Muhammed Ali impersonator was using the fake account to defraud unsuspecting innocent citizens. This is contained in a statement signed by the Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Bright Edafe. The Police image maker said, “The fraudster has reached out to some people via the Facebook handle displaying some pictures of the CP in mufti and in Police uniform with the username Muhammad Ali Ari. “He further stated that the CP graduated from UNIJOS which is not true. He is using the account to fraudulently solicit financial assistance from members of the public who have been deceived to believe that they are chatting with the CP. “The CP is using this medium to inform the general public to disregard any request or message from this Facebook handle, as it is the handiwork of a criminal element parading himself as the CP with intent to defraud. “The CP assures members of the public that measures have been put in place with a view to arresting this impostor and to ensure that he is brought to book.”
