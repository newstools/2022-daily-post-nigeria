The All Progressives Congress (APC) has suggested the harmonisation of party structure in Kano as a way to resolve the face-off in the chapter. APC Chairman, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Mai Mala Buni, wrote to Governor Abdullahi Ganduje on Monday. The letter signed by his Chief of Staff, Abdullahi Gashua, called for restoration of sanity and unity of purpose in the State. Buni said he met the two sides and painstakingly examined all issues which bothered mainly on exclusion. The APC affirmed Ganduje as APC leader in Kano and encouraged him to demonstrate leadership by accommodating key stakeholders. “That none of the two sides can have 100 per cent of its demands and that you cannot lack what you give, you only lack what you keep,” it said. The national leadership gave terms of reference for caucus formation at local government and state levels. The party urged respective caucus to meet and come up with a proposed structure for all wards and local government. “The proposed structure will be forwarded to the Joint National/State Committee for final vetting or amendment, as the case may be,” it said. The caucus shall have serving Senators, House of Representatives members, House of Assembly members, LG chairmen, their deputy, commissioners, special advisers. APC stressed that the National/State Joint Committee reserved the right to adopt or amend any proposal submitted to it by each caucus. The members are Ganduje; Senator Ibrahim Shekarau; Zamfara Governor, Bello Matawalle; former Speaker Yakubu Dogara and Senator Abba Ali. The committee, to sit in Kano, will have seven days to complete its assignment and submit a report.
