Arsenal legend, Paul Merson, has told the club to sell Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe after this season, if they refuse to sign new contracts. Both players who came through the Gunners academy, have become key members of Mikel Arteta’s squad. But Merson is sceptical over whether Saka and Smith Rowe will stick around. While Saka is only tied down for another two years, Smith Rowe penned a long-term deal keeping him at the Emirates until 2026 just seven months ago. “They are top drawer and they are going to be vital to Arsenal finishing in the top four this season. But I think Arsenal should get them tied down now,” Merson wrote in his Daily Star column. “They should be talking now about five year contracts. Get them signed, and if they don’t want to sign, then sell them in the summer. “Don’t hang around and let them run their contracts down and let them go for next to nothing. Test the water because there will be teams chasing them.”
