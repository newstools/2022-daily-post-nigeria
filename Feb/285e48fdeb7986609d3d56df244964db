Mohammed Hassan, a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain in Yobe, has defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC). The politician, also known as Dambu, represented Yobe South Senatorial District in the National Assembly. He was received in Abuja by Yobe Governor and Chairman, APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Mai Buni. In attendance were Senate President, Ahmad Lawan; Senator Ibrahim Bomoi; Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu; Yobe APC Chairman, Muhammadu Gadaka. “The exit of the former legislator has created a huge vacuum to the opposition party”, said Buni’s spokesman, Mamman Mohammed. Hassan promised to work with the APC leadership at the State and the national levels. The defection boosts the party’s ranks in Yobe South comprising Fune, Potiskum, Nangere and Fika Local Government Areas.
