There is heavy security presence at the premises of the Federal High Court, Osogbo, Osun State, on Wednesday as the court is set to deliver its ruling on the jurisdiction to hear the case filed by The Osun Progressives (TOP) demanding a declaration that the August 31, 2021, ward congress held by the All Progressives Congress (APC) caucus is authentic. The caucus, which had earlier approached the court seeking the nullification of the Gbenga Elegbeleye-led ward congress committee in the state, noted that due process was not followed in consonance with the congress guidelines and the party constitution. However, the defendants in the suit had also filed a counter-affidavit seeking the court to strike out the case as it lacked the jurisdiction to entertain such a case. Ruling on the jurisdiction was adjourned to today by Justice Emmanuel Ayoola of the Federal High Court.
