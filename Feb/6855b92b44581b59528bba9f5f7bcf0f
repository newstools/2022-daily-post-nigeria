Former Chelsea midfielder, John Obi Mikel, has reacted to the club’s FIFA Club World Cup triumph. Chelsea had on Saturday defeated Palmeiras 2-1 in the FIFA Club World Cup final at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The FIFA Club World Club final clash ended in a 1-1 draw in normal time after Romelu Lukaku and Raphael Veiga scored for both Chelsea and Palmeiras. But, Kai Havertz scored a late penalty in the second half of extra-time to ensure Chelsea defeated the Brazilian side to win their first FIFA Club World Cup. However, after the game, Chelsea posted on Instagram, “CHAMPIONS OF THE WORLD!!
#ClubWorldCup #CFC #Chelsea”, with an accompanying picture of Havertz celebrating his goal. And Mikel, who made 372 appearances for Chelsea, responded by liking the post. The FIFA Club World Cup is the one trophy never won by Mikel during a ten-and-a-half-year at Chelsea, having won the Premier League, League Cup, FA Cup, Community Shield, Champions League and Europa League with the West London club.
