A Federal High Court in Abuja, on Thursday, ordered the interim forfeiture of a property at Plot 1032 & 1033 Cadastral Zone AO3, Takum Close, off Michika St, Ahmadu Bello Way in Garki Abuja. The property is owned by former Imo State Governor and serving Senator, Rochas Okorocha. Justice Emeka Nwite gave the order while ruling on an ex-parte order brought by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The agency relied on section 44(2) of the 1999 constitution (as amended), and section 17 of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Fraud Related Offences Act No. 14 2006. EFCC sought the forfeiture of the property on the grounds that it was acquired illegally. The commission said in 2018, Abtisal Global Ltd and Archivisual Solution Ltd, in which Okorocha is believed to have interest, received N222million from the Imo government to develop the said property. The court directed that the interim forfeiture order be published in the national dailies. Anyone with interest in the property would be asked to show cause why it should not be forfeited to the Federal Government of Nigeria. Justice Nwite adjourned till April 13, 2022 for consideration of final forfeiture of the property.
