The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Cross River State has said that Gov Nyesom Wike of Rivers State is attempting to import political cannibalism into their once politically peaceful state. They further alleged that Wike was behind the vandalisation of the fence of the Calabar Sports Club where the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) staged a rally in the state against police advice last weekend. Chairman of APC in the state, Alphonsus Ogar Eba stated this during a press interaction at the APC office in Calabar. “What Gov Wike has set to do over time is to import the political cannibalism from Rivers State politics into Cross River State. “But Cross Riverians will no longer continue to allow him to cross the boundary of the line of political decency”, he said. “We are a peace loving people and very decent and civilised and led by two very prominent professors. “We will not get so low to the level of a governor that is almost like a motor park tout. “We want the world to know that Governor Ben Ayade with his level of exposure, education, and political capital in him cannot reduce himself to the level of a man who the poverty of intellectual capacity has reduced to a street boy. “Nyesome Wike has been a constant meddlesome interloper and today we want to say that enough is enough. “He was here on Saturday to incite violence in Cross River State but it took the maturity of our leader and governor, Professor Ben Ayade to avert violence.” The ruling APC has therefore threatened to stop Wike from entering the state for political activities. He said the state will no longer condone his constant meddlesomeness as the state is not an extension of Rivers State.
