A wanted thug, Tolani Yusuf, has been apprehended and is now in police custody. He was arrested by the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID) of the Lagos State Police Command, Eagle Online reports. Yusuf is the head of ‘O strong’, a notorious group that has been terrorizing residents of Lagos Island areas. The gang leader and his boys are accused of perpetrating a series of crimes, including robberies and murders. The police launched a fresh manhunt after Yusuf recently slashed one Tajudeen Sodiq’s stomach. The impact sliced the victim’s intestine. The attacker ran away after some youths overpowered him and forced the knife out of his hand. Yusuf was said to have boasted that he would only spend three months in police detention because he works for politicians. Lagos Island is reputed for having a high number of miscreants. The peace there has remained fragile for decades as rivals attack each other at will. In January, two days of bloody clashes in Idumota, Kosoko, Oluwole, Martins and Balogun crippled business activities. Following outrage and accusations of official cover, the Lagos government directed the police to find and prosecute the masterminds. Less than one week later, Azeez Adekunle Lawal (Kunle Poly) Prince Idowu Onikoyi Johnson and Agboola Akeem Kosoko were arrested. A Yaba Chief Magistrate’s Court ordered that Lawal, a National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) leader, and others be remanded at the Police Zone 2 Headquarters, Onikan.
