Super Eagles star, Chidera Ejuke, has explained why Nigeria failed to go beyond the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, Round of 16 stages. Nigeria had qualified for the 2021 AFCON round of 16 in Cameroon after winning all their matches in the group stage against Egypt, Sudan and Guinea-Bissau. The Super Eagles were, however, eliminated from the AFCON last-16 after losing 1-0 against Tunisia under the tutelage of interim coach Augustine Eguavoen. But Ejuke, who did not make it off the bench against Tunisia, said the Super Eagles did not make use of their chances against the Carthage Eagles after Alex Iwobi’s red card. “Everyone was interested in how we played there, how we lost to Tunisia in the 1/8 finals,” Ejuke told CSKA’s official website. “Of course, it was very disappointing, because we have good players, we did well in the group stage. We hoped for more, but our time will come.” He added: “I did not play myself — you can, of course, judge from the outside, but those who were on the field have a weightier opinion. “The Tunisians did a little more to win than we did. The team continued to create chances after the red card but did not use them. The tide turned against us.”
