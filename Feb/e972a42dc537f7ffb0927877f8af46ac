Following reports that Governor Gboyega Oyetola is leading in the All Progressives Congress (APC) primary election in Osun State, the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, has urged his supporters not to take laws into their hands but to leave the rest to the Almighty God. Aregbesola, a two-term former governor of the state, and Oyetola have been at loggerheads. The minister is openly campaigning against the governor for reelection. DAILY POST reported that Aregbesola lost his Ward 8 to Oyetola in the Saturday primary. Earlier, the minister’s faction of the party rejected and condemned the conduct of the primary election, saying it is nothing but a sham with a fraudulent process to favour Governor Oyetola. The Aregbesola faction accused the Osun APC Primary Election Committee, led by Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrasaq of Kwara State, of lacking credibility and fairness. Aregbesola urged his supporters to explore all peaceful and legal means for addressing the matter in order to obtain justice. The minister, in a statement signed by his media aide, Sola Fasure, said he is aware of all the misconduct in the primary organised by a committee set up by the national leadership of APC. Aregbesola urged his supporters to “maintain your cool and calm. Be not downcast, be not agitated. Hold your head high. We are still receiving and studying all these reports and will take a definitive position on them.”
