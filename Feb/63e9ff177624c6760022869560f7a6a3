Former Chelsea star, Joe Cole has told the current Manchester United players, including Cristiano Ronaldo, to look in the mirror because they are not performing well this season. Cole said this while speaking on the current situation at Manchester United. Man United’s struggles have continued under their interim manager, Ralf Rangnick. The Red Devils currently sit outside of the Premier League top-four after their 1-1 draw against Burnley on Tuesday. But Cole believes Man United players got their former managers Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Jose Mourinho sacked, amid reports that Rangnick is also losing the dressing room at Old Trafford. “The players got Jose [Mourinho] sacked, Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer] seems like the perfect man-manager, a nice guy. You have gone from Jose to Ole… What do this group of players want? “And now you hear mutterings that they are not happy with Rangnick. “The players need to look in the mirror. You are Manchester United players, but they are not performing like it,” Cole told JOE.
