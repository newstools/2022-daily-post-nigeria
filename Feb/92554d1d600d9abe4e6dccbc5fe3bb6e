The National Youth Leader of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Muhammed Kadade Suleiman, on Thursday, threatened to organise a nationwide protest if the impeachment on Zamfara Deputy Governor, Mahadi Ali, was not reversed. The Zamfara State House of Assembly had on Wednesday February 23, 2022, impeached the state’s deputy governor, Mahadi Ali. The PDP youth Leader who, described the impeachment of the Ali as an affront on democracy and the rule of law, in a statement on Thursday, noted that Nigerians are witnesses to the “heinous act of lawlessness” on the part of Zamfara State government as it disregarded the pending suit instituted by the Deputy Governor. According to him, what is even more condemnable is the manner in which the three arms of government left important issues of insecurity bedeviling innocent indigenes of the state to focus on a personal vendetta. The youth leader said Governor Bello Matawalle went against reason and common sense to wage a war of aggression against the Deputy Governor and Nigerian youths in general. He added that the fact that no allegation was made against his competence or capacity to hold and discharge the activities of the office, makes it even more brazen and reckless.
