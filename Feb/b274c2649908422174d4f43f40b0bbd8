Omoyele Sowore, presidential candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC) in the 2019 election, has been allegedly arrested by police in Abuja. Femi Adeyeye, the National Publicity Secretary of the party, disclosed this in a statement released on Thursday. According to the statement, Sowore was arrested after stepping out of the court where the Chairman and members of the party had converged to witness the case of the party against the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, and usurpers. Adeyeye claimed that Sowore was taken to the former Special Anti Robbery Squad, which is popularly called “Abattoir” Sowore had filed an appeal against the ruling of the Federal High Court that affirmed Leonard Nzenwa as the acting Chairman of the AAC. The statement partly read, “As at the time of releasing this statement that he [Sowore] is currently at the dreaded SARS unit called ‘Abattoir’ and men from that station were the ones who carried out the arrest.” The statement added that the specific reason for his arrest remains sketchy.
