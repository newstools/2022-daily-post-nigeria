North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, has said on Thursday the alliance had no combat troops inside Ukraine and had no plans to send any into the country. Stoltenberg said this at a news conference on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Recall that Russia President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale military invasion of his country’s neighbour on Thursday morning. Russian missiles, tanks and warplanes targeted airports, military bases and cities in Ukraine, with air raid sirens also heard in the capital Kyiv. “There are no NATO combat troops, no NATO troops at all inside Ukraine. “ We have made it clear that we don’t have any plans and intention of deploying NATO troops to Ukraine. “What we have made clear is that we have already increased and we are increasing the presence of NATO troops in the eastern part of the alliance on NATO territory,” Stoltenberg said. Ukraine is a partner of the Western defence alliance but not a NATO member.
