President Muhammadu Buhari has condoled Senator Ben Murray-Bruce and his family over the passing of their mother and matriarch, Mama Margaret Murray-Bruce. Mama Magaret Murray-Bruce died at 95 years of age. A statement issued by Buhari’s Senior Special Assistant on Media & Publicity, Garba Shehu, said Buhari paid tribute to the peace-loving and deeply religious woman who invested so much of her God-given resources and talent in developing people, adopting many children, inspiring them to face life’s challenges with determination, optimism and joy. The President urged Senator Ben Murray-Bruce, Founder Silverbird Group, Francis Murray-Bruce and Mr Guy Murray-Bruce, President, Silverbird Group and Chairman, Independent Broadcasters Association of Nigeria (IBAN) and other members of the Murray-Bruce family to find inspiration from their mother’s legacy, particularly her personal example of decency and always looking out for the best in others. He also prayed for the repose of the soul of the departed and comfort for the loved ones who mourn.
