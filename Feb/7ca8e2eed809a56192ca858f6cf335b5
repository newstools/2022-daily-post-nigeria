The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), on Wednesday, received 159 Nigerians stranded from Libya. They landed at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) in Lagos. NEMA Director-General, Habib Mustapha, represented by the Acting Coordinator, Lagos Territorial Office, Ibrahim Farinloye spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). The Nigerians arrived at the Cargo Wing of the MMIA at about 7.10p.m. with Al Buraq Airline with registration number 5A-DMG. They returned with the support of International Organisation for Migration (IOM) through a voluntary repatriation programme for the distressed. The returnees are 67 male adults, 80 female adults, six male and four female children, with two infants (one male and one female). “It is normal in life to struggle for better and improved livelihoods but in the struggle, we must avoid endangering our lives. There is nowhere in the world that its citizens will not have to strive in attaining good life within the limited resources available in that country. “Nigeria is well endowed far more than most countries that young Nigerians are travelling to in seeking greener pastures that are no longer there,” he said. The NEMA chief urged citizens to look inward and take advantage of the countless opportunities in the country. The Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Refugee Commission, Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) and the Police also received the returnees.
