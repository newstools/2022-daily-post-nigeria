The Nigerian government has disclosed four borders in Ukraine safe for its citizens seeking to leave the country to be evacuated. Abike Dabiri-Erewa, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM), on Saturday said the borders safe for Nigerians are Hrebenne-Rawa Ruska, Korczowa-Krakowiec, Medyka-Szeginie and Budomierz-Hurszew. “For Nigerians in Ukraine trying to cross over to Poland, there are eight borders between Poland and Ukraine, four borders are recommended,” the NiDCOM boss said. She noted that volunteer groups, as well as staff of the Nigerian embassy, are at these borders to help stranded Nigerians out. “We’re going to provide contact details of these Nigerians that will be there to help you out and the convergence point,” she added.
