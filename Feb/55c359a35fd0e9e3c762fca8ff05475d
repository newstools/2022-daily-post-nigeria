CP Idrisu Dauda Dabban, who replaced AIG Sanusi Bubba as the Katsina State Police Commissioner has warned bandits terrorising the state to surrender before the police smoke them out. According to the new Katsina Police Commissioner, who assumed duty on Friday, “the state command will do its best to reduce to the barest minimum acts of criminalities in the state, especially as it relates to banditry, urging the terrorists to repent and shun their devilish activities. CP Dabban, however, commended the efforts of erstwhile state police commissioner, AIG Sanusi Buba, whom he said has done very well, assuring that he will continue from where his predecessor stopped. He also solicited the cooperation and support of people in the state in the area of providing useful information to help tame the tide of banditry and other crimes bedevilling the state. Dabban said, ”we are well aware of the main problem facing this command, which is mainly banditry. The banditry situation is very unfortunate but we’ll try our best and with the help of God we will move forward “Anything that’s criminal doesn’t pay. Bandits should abandon their devilish activities and surrender before we get to them by the special grace of God.” Before his deployment as Katsina Police Commissioner, Idrisu Dabban, was the CP Communications, Department of Information and Communication Technology, Force Headquarters, Abuja.
