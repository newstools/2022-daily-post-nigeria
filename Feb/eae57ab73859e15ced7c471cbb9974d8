The Osun State Government has promised to give priority attention to the welfare and safety of National Youth Service Corps members in the state. The state government also assured that it will ensure that it adds its voice to the call for the establishment of the NYSC Trust Fund as it will largely support the scheme’s drive in expansion and maintenance of camp facilities. This is according to Governor Adegboyega Oyetola at the passing out ceremony of the 2021 Batch A, Stream 1 National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in Osogbo on Thursday. Represented by Yemi Lawal, the Osun State Commissioner for Youths and Sports, Oyetola emphasised that the trust fund will also serve as a veritable tool in setting up entrepreneurs amongst others when established. The governor who revealed that their service had impacted the socio-economic landscape of the state assured the outgoing corps members that their contributions are appreciated. Speaking earlier, Winifred Shokpeka, the Osun NYSC coordinator called on them to hit the ground running by putting into practice all that they have learned during their service year. Shokpeka who cautioned the corps members to be wary of vices that have become the order of the day urged them to inculcate discipline, hard work, self-reliance in their daily habits.
