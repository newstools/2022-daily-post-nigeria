The leadership of the National Association of Osun State Students, NAOSS, has asked the state’s Commissioner of Police, Wale Olokode, to thoroughly investigate the circumstances that led to the death of a graduate of Federal Polytechnic Ede, Hassan Adedeji. Adedeji, a Higher National Diploma graduate of Banking and Finance, was gunned down together with a commercial motorcyclist by a suspected cultist in the early hours of Thursday at the Agbalemobode area of Ede. Following the incident, the police said it has arrested two suspects in connection to the killing while Rasheed Okoolu, the prime suspect, is still on the run. The student union president, Comrade Yusuf Agboola, urged police to intensify efforts in the investigation into the ugly incident that claimed Hassan alongside a motorcyclist. Agboola, in a statement on Sunday, noted that the Association will not fold its arm in the face of such brutality against its member, vowing that no effort will be spared in ensuring that the culprits are prosecuted to serve as a deterrent to other evil-minded individuals. The students’ leader commiserated with the family of the deceased and warned all students of the state to shun any illicit group, cultism and stay clear of political violence. According to him, “injury to one is an injury to all, hence, all Osun State students demand justice for one of us, Hassan Adedeji who was brutally murdered by an unknown gunman. “We also believe that justice delayed is justice denied and we charge all concerned stakeholders to apprehend the culprit and bash the sledgehammer of law on them. We will not keep silent, no matter how long the investigation lasts.”
