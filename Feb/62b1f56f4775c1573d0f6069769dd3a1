Immediate past Chief of Army Staff and Nigeria’s Ambassador to the Benin Republic, Lt. Gen. Yusuf Tukur Buratai (rtd), on Sunday, reacted to calls to join the 2023 Presidential race. Buratai, who distanced himself from such calls and presidential campaign posters of him making rounds on social media, said he is contented with his work as an envoy. He disclosed that he has never indicated interest or discussed with any group about running for the Presidency in 2023. A group known as the All Progressives Congress (APC) Door-to-door Campaign Forum had urged the former Army Chief to run for the Presidency. The group had made the call during a press conference in Kaduna State. Reacting, the Ambassador distanced himself from such calls. A statement signed by former Army spokesman, Gen Sani Kukasheka (rtd), said Buratai was not behind the group or those campaigning for him. The statement said, “Nigeria’s ambassador is contented with his present work and committed to national service as an envoy. “Therefore, such calls and posters should be discountenanced as they did not emanate from him, nor is he interested in them. “It is entirely the handiwork of some people for reasons best known to them. “He remains loyal and eternally grateful to President Muhammadu Buhari for the opportunity to serve.”
