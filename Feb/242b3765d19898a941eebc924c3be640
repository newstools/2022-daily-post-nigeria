Following the postponement of the All Progressive Congress national convention, the party’s leadership has taken steps to beef up security around its national secretariat. DAILY POST observed that a detachment of armed police personnel were seen around the vicinity of the secretariat on Monday afternoon This came after a letter written by the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), announcing the indefinite postponement of its national convention was made public. Sources also confirmed that the security deployment may not be unconnected with a security report that certain persons had been mobilised to stage demonstrations against the Caretaker committee. Recall that DAILY POST broke the news on Sunday night of President Muhammadu Buhari approving an extension of the convention over logistic reasons.
