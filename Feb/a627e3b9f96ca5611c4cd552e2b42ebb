The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kebbi State has endorsed the presidential ambition of Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal. The aspirant, on a nationwide consultation, was in the state on Tuesday after visiting Zamfara State on Monday. Ex-Governor Attahairu Bafarawa; ex-Deputy Governor, Mukhtar Shagari; ex-Minister Bello Suleiman and Sokoto PDP youth leader, Mustpaha Mbinji accompanied him. Tambuwal told Kebbi party leaders that he was convinced the PDP is back into winning ways and will defeat the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2023. “APC has failed Nigeria. International organisations have rated Nigeria as the world poverty capital and it’s time to change the narrative. “PDP has ruled Nigeria before and now APC have ruled. You all have seen the negative difference. “The mantra they campaigned on has failed. It is time for us to change the fortunes of this country. I urge you all to remain committed”, he said. The governor hailed the Kebbi exco for the success recorded during the local government elections in the state. State Chairman, Usman Bello Suru, assured Tambuwal that the chapter was in support of his presidential bid. PDP chieftains including former Minister of Special Duties, Kabiru Turaki; retired General Ishaya Bamayi; retired General Bello Siyaki, Bello Mohammed, attended.
