The First Lady of Nigeria, Mrs. Aisha Buhari, has reiterated her worries on the gruesome murder of a five-year-old Hanifa Abubakar, saying, a quick punishment should be served on the culprit as a detriment to others. “In a situation where children are no longer safe in schools, then, our society has become something else. We want to see those behind the killing being punished immediately,” Aisha emphasized. Aisha, who is in Kano State on a private visit, also took time to condole with the late Hanifa’s family, saying, “only a sound punishment would pacify mothers who are the most touched in the killing of the innocent girl.” She said, “We want to see one or two persons face the law and be quickly executed, so we will know that corrective measures have been taken.” “Right now, the Nigerian society has become something else, if a whole teacher who is trusted with the children would be behind this dastardly act, he should be punished immediately so that others would learn.” Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State, who alongside his wife, Hafsat, received the First Lady, emphasized that the government was highly ready to assent to the death warrant of Hanifa’s killer. “I will not waste a second to sign the death warrant of those behind the killing of the five-year-old Hanifa Abubakar,” Ganduje assured. He said his government has already provided some relief to the bereaved family to cushion the pain of their daughter’s death.
