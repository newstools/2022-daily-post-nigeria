Jigawa State Governor, Muhammad Badaru Abubakar, has said his administration had encouraged and motivated youths to takeover the mantle of leadership. Badaru stated this while responding to questions from newsmen, after he was honoured by Hadejia Ina Mafita, a non-political community-based organization in Hadejia. The governor stated that since assuming leadership of the state, his administration had involved youths in running the affairs of the state. “We have involved youths in different positions, majority of our state assembly members, local government chairmen and special assistants are youths. “We did that to encourage them to be upright and work hard so they can take over from us.” The governor also stated that he never anointed any candidate to be his successor in 2023. “The choice of my successor is left for the people of the state. My wish is that the next governor must be somebody who is fair-minded, a good listener and above all, who will continue with the good work we have started. “My prayer is that, we get somebody who is humble, have the fear of Allah in him and who will continue from where we will stop and who will listen to the people like we do,” Badaru stated.
