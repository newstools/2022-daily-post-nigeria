Abdullahi Adamu, an Adamawa State resident has confessed to defiling a five-year-old schoolgirl. Currently remanded in a Mubi prison, the alleged paedophile admitted to abusing the Nursery 3 pupil by luring her with biscuits. The 28-year-old Abdullahi who is of Unguwan Madina in Mubi North Local Government Area lured the little girl into an uncompleted building where he defiled her. It was learnt on Tuesday that Abdullahi who is a neighbour to the little girl, accosted her while she was on her way home after school. He allegedly asked the little girl to accompany him to get biscuits for her from a nearby shop, from where he got her into an uncompleted building. The incident got into the open after Abdullahi and the girl were sighted coming out of the uncompleted building by neighbours who suspected something fishy and decided to act. They took the little girl to Mubi General Hospital where it was found that she was raped. When he was arraigned before Chief Magistrate Hamidu Aminu of Chief Magistrate Court 2 in Mubi, the defendant pleaded guilty to the offence.
