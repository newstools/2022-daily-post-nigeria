Chelsea legend, Didier Drogba, has hailed captain Cesar Azpilicueta after the Spaniard made history following the club’s FIFA Club World Cup triumph on Saturday. Azpilicueta at the weekend made history as he led Chelsea to beat Palmeiras 2-1 in the FIFA Club World Cup final. Chelsea’s victory over Palmeiras means Azpilicueta is now the first player in the club’s history to win every major trophy – Premier League, Champions League, Europa League, FA Cup, League Cup, Super Cup, and Club World Cup, available at Stamford Bridge. Reacting after the game, Drogba interrupted Azpilicueta’s interview with Chelsea’s in-house TV channel to praise his former teammate after the Blues won the FIFA Club World Cup. Drogba said: “This guy [Azpilicueta], in two years, has won more trophies than us in 10!” Azpilicueta, meanwhile, said: “I’m really proud. We have come a long way to be here. “It is a moment to be proud and enjoy it because we know how difficult it is to win this trophy. 2012 hurt a lot and we took more than nine years to be back. We missed out in 2012 and we didn’t want to miss the cup again. “This time, the medal is gold, and the other one is silver. I made sure I wasn’t coming back with the same colour of medal. It was a difficult game. World champions, it is not easy. We showed the team we are. “When I arrived in 2012, I couldn’t imagine the journey I would go on. I am really proud to be the Chelsea captain leading the club on and off the pitch. “This title feels very good because it is the first time in our history. The club deserves it, the owner deserves it, and I am proud we achieved it.”
