Newly-appointed Nigeria head coach, Emmanuel Amuneke, has expressed his gratitude to fans and the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) for considering him for the job. The NFF announced the decision to drop Jose Peseiro and named Amuneke as the coach of the Super Eagles. The ex-Barcelona winger will work together with interim Technical Adviser Augustine Eguavoen, as well as Salisu Yusuf, Joseph Yobo, and Alloy Agu. Amuneke has, however, remained coy about the terms of his agreement with the federation. “I’m always available to serve my country,” Amuneke said, as quoted by Brila FM. “I’m grateful to Nigerians and the Federation for looking in my direction. For now, there’s no use speaking much; when it’s time, I will grant an interview about the job.” Amuneke played for Egypt’s Zamalek, Barcelona, and Sporting Lisbon. But his finest moments came with the Super Eagles and the Dream Team as he scored the crucial goals that won the 1994 Africa Cup of Nations and Atlanta ’96 Olympics football gold for Nigeria. Amuneke was named the African Footballer of the Year in 1994 and the BBC African Footballer of the Year two years later. An injury forced Amuneke to quit football in 2004, and he took to coaching after earning his licence.
