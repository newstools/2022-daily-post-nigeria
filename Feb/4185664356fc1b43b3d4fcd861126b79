The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has assured citizens of adequate petrol supply next week. The agency gave the assurance at the National Economic Council (NEC) meeting at the State House on Thursday. At the meeting chaired by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, NEC resolved to encourage the growth of the automotive industry in Nigeria by improving patronage of locally manufactured vehicles. In attendance were Governors, Ministers, Central Bank (CBN) Governor and some heads of federal agencies. Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Niyi Adebayo, said despite the potentials, the local automotive industry has been significantly plagued by several challenges. He listed weak demand for locally assembled cars and lack of government patronage which could have assisted the assemblers in achieving economies of scale. FEC also received an update on the COVID-19 vaccination by the Executive Director, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr. Faisal Shuaib. Shuaib reminded the council that by March next month, the country needs to reach 50 per cent of eligible vaccination at least for the first dose. The NPHCDA chief added that the plan is to achieve 70 per cent full vaccination rate by December The EC added that the FCT, Nasarawa, Jigawa, Ogun, Osun and Kwara States are hitting the mark.
