A kidnap victim, Alaga Olayemi, an indigene of Oke-Onigbin in Isin Local Government Area of Kwara State, has been set free by his abductors. The 69-year-old victim was released on Friday at Isanlu-Isin area by his abductors after his family paid a ransom of one million naira, according to security sources. DAILY POST gathered that it was the second time the family paid ransom to the abductors at the same point of abduction. The victim, Alaga Olayemi spent about five days in the den of his captors before his eventual freedom, the sources added. Efforts to reach the spokesman of the state police command, Mr. Okasanmi Ajayi in Ilorin on Tuesday proved abortive. Recall that the state police command has a zero tolerance for ransom payment by families of kidnap victims in the state.
