The 2019 presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, has said the Federal High Court suit challenging his Nigerian citizenship was politically orchestrated to stop him from enjoying his rights and privileges. Justice Inyang Edem Ekwo on Monday struck out the suit instituted by the Incorporated Trustees of Egalitarian Mission for Africa on the account that the Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) had no legal right in the first instance to query the citizenship of the former Vice President. The justice cautioned the NGO to refrain from filing frivolous applications targeted at harassing politically exposed Nigerians. In his reaction, the Waziri Adamawa in a statement by his media adviser, Paul Ibe, on Monday explained that “it was clear from the onset that this was a politically orchestrated agenda to stop His Excellency Atiku Abubakar from enjoying the rights and privileges that have been confirmed by the constitution, the grundnorm of the land. “All these orchestrations are aimed at stopping Atiku Abubakar from serving his fatherland at the highest level and thereby denying Nigerians of the immeasurable benefits of that service. “But we take solace in the words in the Bible that: ‘Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake’.”
