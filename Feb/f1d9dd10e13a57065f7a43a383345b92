Prince Kanu Meme, one of the siblings of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Wednesday said there is “fresh evidence” in the trial of the agitator. Meme claimed that Kanu “is still technically in Kenya from the new evidence.” He, however, did not elaborate on “the new evidence,” which is linked to Kanu’s rearrest and repatriation from Kenya. The IPOB leader is believed to have been arrested in Kenya last year June. Kanu was detained for eight days in Kenya before his repatriation to Nigeria to continue his trial before Justice Binta Nyako-led Federal High Court. Upon his return, Kanu was slammed with charges bordering on terrorism. A 15-count terrorism charge was slammed on Kanu by the Federal Government. He pleaded not guilty to the charges and asked the Federal High Court, Abuja, to discharge and acquit him without standing trial because the charges were not worth being defended. However, Meme, in a Facebook post wrote: “Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is still technically in Kenya from the new evidence.”
