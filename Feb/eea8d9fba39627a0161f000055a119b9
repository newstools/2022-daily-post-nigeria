Paris Saint-Germain forward, Lionel Messi, has admitted that the best team does not always win in the Champions League. Messi, who missed a penalty during PSG’s Champions League round of 16 first-leg 1-0 victory against Real Madrid on Tuesday night, said it is difficult to win the European competition. Recall that Messi’s teammate, Kylian Mbappe, scored the only goal of the match to ensure PSG defeated Real Madrid in Paris. Speaking to PSG Magazine, Messi said the smallest error could get a team knocked out of the Champions League. The Argentine captain said, “It’s not easy to win the Champions League because it’s a competition that brings together the best teams and where the smallest detail, the smallest error, can get you knocked out. “I think we have a team that can try and win it. We’re excited by that idea and we are confident that we’ll get there, but we have to take it step by step. Again, it’s hard to win the Champions League. The best team does not always win.”
