A former member of the Ekiti State House of Assembly, Olowo Ajiboye wants the people of the state to ensure that their decision in this year’s governorship election is influenced by their conscience, genuine love for the state as well as for its developmental needs. Ajiboye told our correspondent in an interview at Itapa-Ekiti that if the decision of the people is motivated by such genuine desire, they would choose a person well known to them and who they had identified with over time. He said such an individual must be someone who had a functional vision that had been tested over time, someone who had integrity and character that appeals to civil servants, students, youth, market women and old people alike. Ajiboye who is a community leader in Itapa Ekiti in Oye Local Government singled out Chief Segun Oni as an individual who possessed such quality and a personality known to the people. The former legislator urged Chief Segun Oni to heed the call of the people to contest the governorship position to restore the hope of retirees, civil servants and entire citizens who witnessed his performance during his first attempt in office.
