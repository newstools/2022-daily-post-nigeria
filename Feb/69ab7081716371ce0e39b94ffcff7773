Suspected kidnappers on Friday morning kidnapped a nursing mother and her child in Tudun Mun Tsira village of Zangon Shanu, Samaru in Sabon Gari Local Government Area of Kaduna State. A source, who disclosed this to DAILY POST in Kaduna, explained that as the kidnappers stormed the community around 4.00 am Friday, they started shooting sporadically to scare people. However, following a rapid intervention by security operatives, who received a distress call, rescued the kidnapped nursing mother and her child after serious battle between them and the kidnappers. According to him, they went to the house of one Mallam Idris, took his wife who was nursing a baby, and went to another apartment within the community and took one elderly man, Mallam Abubakar Garba Aliyu, and his son who relocated to the area recently. The bandits were said to have injured two residents in the community, who are receiving treatment at an undisclosed hospital. Also, a resident in the area, Alhaji Shehu Madaki, said the gunmen came in their large numbers on motorcycles, with sophisticated weapons and invaded the area through the back fence of the Ahmadu Bello University Zaria. “They picked a nursing mother and her baby at Tudun Mun Tsira village before proceeding to Hayin Liman where they abducted an elderly man, one Alhaji Abubakar along with his grown-up son,” he said. He also explained that security operatives, who responded to a distress call from the community, have rescued the baby and her mother. Mohammed Jalige, Kaduna Police Public Relations Officer, did not pick his calls and did not respond to texts messages sent to him.
