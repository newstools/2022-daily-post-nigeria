Chelsea defender, Antonio Rudiger, has rejected the club’s latest contract offer. Rudiger’s deal is due to expire at the end of the season. The Germany international has already received pre-contract proposals from the likes of Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid. Rudiger has been a resolute at the back for Chelsea, forming a key part of Thomas Tuchel’s side that won the Champions League last season after beating Premier League leaders Manchester City. The centre-back is believed to have turned down Chelsea’s first offer in the region of £140,000-a-week, which would be an improvement on his current salary of around £100,000-a-week. According to Daily Mail, Chelsea informally put forward an increased offer worth closer to £200,000-a-week, but that still falls short of what is needed to get Rudiger to put pen to paper. The report added that Chelsea are still optimistic that they can come to an agreement with Rudiger before the end of the season.
