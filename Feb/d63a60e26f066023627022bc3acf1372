Newcastle midfielder, Bruno Guimarães has claimed that he refused to wait for Arsenal because he wants “to win the Champions League”. The Magpies are second to the bottom of the Premier League and are fighting to avoid relegation. But Guimaraes, who cost £40m, has made a bold prediction about the future of the club ahead of Tuesday’s clash with Everton. When asked why he joined Newcastle, Guimarães said: “They didn’t disguise that the main objective and challenge was remaining in the Premier League this season. “But in the seasons coming, the objective is to be in the Champions League and eventually to win the Champions League. “I believe in the project, I believe in everything they spoke to me about.”
