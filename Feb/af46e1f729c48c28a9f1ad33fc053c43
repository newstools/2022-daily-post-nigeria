The high court sitting in the Akamkpa judicial division of Cross River State has sentenced one Mr Anyanime Festus to death by hanging. The court held that Anyanime had wilfully and gruesomely murdered his 11-year-old twins, Mfoniso Anyanime and Emediong Anyanime, in 2017 after dubbing them, witches. Honourable Justice A. A. Onyebueke delivered the judgment today and convicted the defendant. Anyanime, who is in his 50s, could not defend his allegation of witchery against his daughters when cross-examined. According to a child rights activist, Mr James Ibor, whose Basic Rights Counsel Initiative (BCRI) facilitated the prosecution of the accused, the case was first reported in February 2017, which led to the immediate arrest of the convict by the police after due investigation. Findings confirmed that the police ensured necessary medical examinations and autopsies were done on the deceased children, which aides the judgment. Ibor described the judgment as a great victory to the victims in particular and the Government of Cross River State. He said witchcraft branding and ritual killing has become a pastime in the state Recall that the United Nations has urged nations to take measures against abuses linked to witchcraft beliefs and ritual sacrifice.
