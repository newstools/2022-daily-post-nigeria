Justice IR Minakiri of the Rivers State High Court, Port Harcourt, has adjourned till the 15th of February, 2022, to deliver judgment in a matter instituted by Ogechi Ogwu-Edwin and three other members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its former Caretaker Committee Chairman, Isaac Ogbobula. Justice Minakiri also adjourned till the 23rd of February, 2022, in a suit by Alaibo Soibibo and three others against the APC and Ogbobula. The two sets of plaintiffs are seeking an interlocutory injunction against the APC and its former Caretaker Committee Chairman in the state over the conduct of congresses in Rivers State, asking the court to order fresh congresses. The claimants are praying the court to stop the APC from taking action concerning Congress following the alleged refusal by the APC for them to take part in the process. When the matter came up for judgment today, Minakiri adjourned to 15th and 23rd for judgment due to her health condition. The position of the court gives way for the inauguration of Chairman-elect, Chief Emeka Beke, on Thursday in Abuja as scheduled by the Extraordinary Caretaker and Convention Planning Committee of the party.
