The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Anambra State has said its embattled state chairman, Mr Basil Ejidike, remains sacked. The Andy Uba faction of the party had been celebrating the swearing-in of Ejidike by the national leadership, after a state congress, which produced him as chairman. But the faction led by the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige has dispelled the information, insisting that Ejidike was not sworn in as chairman by the national leadership of the party. A release by the factional publicity secretary, Mr Okelo Madukaife praised the national leadership of the party for not swearing in Ejidike. He said: “Our dynamic chapter of APC congratulates the National Leadership of our great party for the wisdom contained in the decision not to swear in anybody as Chairman of Anambra State Chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC). “This noble decision validates the position of the mainstream of our party in Anambra State that 2018 officials remain in charge of our affairs until congresses can hold as leadership abhors a vacuum. Madukaife said: “We urge aggrieved party faithful who are understandably disappointed at the level of desperation from a camp fronting a sacked former Chairman as ‘sworn in’, to look beyond the ruse. “Nothing of the sort has happened and nothing like that is likely to happen anytime soon, against the spirit of Anambra. This struggle to get our party back to sanity may take some time. It may draw some energy. But it is a battle that must be won. “The Anambra public should note that as a chapter, we have not elected any officials into any cadre of the State Executive and have not held any congress. Anyone who chooses to deal with any person claiming to have been ‘elected’ after May 19, 2018, without any voting, does so at great risk, which we disown.”
