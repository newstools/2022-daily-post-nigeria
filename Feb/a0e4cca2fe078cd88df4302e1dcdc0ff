Former Nigeria international, Victor Moses has said that Spartak Moscow’s coach, Paolo Vanoli, was a factor in his decision to extend his contract with the Russian side. The winger recently signed a contract extension to keep him at the capital outfit till the end of the 2023-2024 season. Moses said Spartak Moscow’s appointment of Paolo Vanoli as coach made his decision easier. Moses and Vanoli worked together at Chelsea for two seasons when the Italian was assistant manager to Antonio Conte. Asked why he decided to remain at the Russian side and if Vanoli influenced his decision, Moses told Spartak Moscow’s YouTube channel, “Yes 100 percent. He’s a top manager, worked with top people in the game. “It’s nothing new to me, I have worked with him for three years and I’m delighted to see him here and obviously I’m going to do all my best. “I know the players, everyone, we are going to work hard together as a team and make sure we achieve what we want to achieve this season and become successful as a team.”
