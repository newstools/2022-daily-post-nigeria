Veteran singer, Eedris Abdulkareem has called for sanctions on the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) for the supply of adulterated petrol across the country. The Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority, NMDPRA, confirmed that the supply of petrol with methanol quantities above Nigeria’s specification found in the supply chain was responsible for scarcity and long queues at filling stations across the country. It also assured that oil marketers had been directed to ensure a sufficient supply of petrol in all outlets all over the country. NMDPRA noted that the limited quantity of the affected fuel has been withdrawn from the market and the source supplier identified. However, reacting, Abdulkareem said NNPC should be sanctioned for the importation of contaminated petrol responsible for the fuel scarcity in the country if Nigeria had a president. On his Instagram page, he wrote: “If we had a president, the entire management of NNPC will face sanctions for the importation of contaminated petrol. “Yahoo Yahoo government.”
