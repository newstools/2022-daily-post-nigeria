Two suspected members of the outlawed “Yan Sa Kai” vigilante group have been arrested by the Katsina Police Command for killing and dumping a man’s corpse inside an abandoned well in the outskirts of a village in Kankia Local Government Area of Katsina State. According to the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in the State, SP Gambo Isah, who paraded the suspects before newsmen, the outlawed vigilante members abducted a Fulani herdsman who came into Kankia Market when one of them identified him as a suspected bandit-terrorist. He said without any investigation, they dragged him to the forest, beat him up and eventually killed him and threw his dead body into an abandoned well in the forest. SP Gambo identified the two suspected members of the outlawed vigilante members currently in police net as Haruna Sani 37, from Sabarawa village in Kusada LGA and Bishir Ma’azu 20, alias (aka Kaura) of Nasarawa village, Sukuntimi in Kankia LGA. According to the PPRO, “the duo conspired with three other members of the outlawed vigilante group, currently at large, when they abducted one Abdulrazak Harisu 27, of Karau village in Shanono LGA of Kano state, at Rimaye village, kankia LGA in Katsina state, and took him to a nearby bush where they killed him and disposed his body in an abandoned well.” While admitting their role in the killing of Harisu, the suspect said: “a fellow vigilante from the same community as Harisu asked us to assist in investigating the deceased for missing goats in their community, alleging that he was arrested for stealing a goat before and since he was released, there have been cases of missing goats here and there. “So, we dragged him to the bush, beat him up, he finally died and his body was dumped in an abandoned well in the bush.”
