President Muhammadu Buhari has declared that he would back any young person who vies for any position in the upcoming All Progressives Congress, APC, national convention. The president also mandated his Chief of Staff, Ibrahim Gambari and Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, to ensure that all ministers and heads of agencies include young people with the requisite skills and experience in all boards and committees of the Federal Government. Buhari gave this directive when he received members of the APC National Youth Lobby Group in Abuja on Friday. Buhari also agreed with the idea of setting up a Presidential Committee on Youth in liaison with the youth leader, requesting Mustapha and Gambari to work out the modalities for its operationalization. ”I will also support the aspirations of credible and committed young people who are vying for positions in the upcoming convention,” he said. “Hard working and exemplary individuals should be identified and encouraged and mentored. ”It should be a deliberate policy of the progressives in ensuring that we have a robust succession plan in place,” he said. Commending members of the APC National Youth Lobby group for the work they are doing for the party, the president said: ‘You are not begging, but negotiating, staking a claim and seeking to add value, which is admirable.”
