Popular Nigerian activist, Aisha Yesufu has mimicked the Academic Union of Universities, ASUU for embarking on a nationwide strike following the Federal Government’s inability to meet their demands. According to the Bring Back Our Girls campaigner, ASUU, through the roles they play as returning officers during elections, contributed to the bad governance being experienced in the country. In a tweet on her official Twitter handle, Aisha asked the union not to expect good salaries without good governance. She said, “What has ASUU done in the fight for good governance in Nigeria? How has ASUU ensured credibility in our electoral system seeing that their members played key roles during election? “ASUU thinks it can get good pay without good governance? They even went on strike over the payment method”. ASUU shut down public universities on Monday when it announced a one month strike to force the FG to implement agreements the parties had entered into during previous industrial actions.
