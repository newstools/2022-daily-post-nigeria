Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State has said the State is relatively peaceful. Zulum explained that the relative peace being witnessed in the State was due to the recent military onslaught against insurgents. The Governor disclosed this after his closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House yesterday. A tweet by Buhari’s Personal Assistant on New Media, Bashir Ahmad, said the Governor updated the President on the latest security development in the State. According to Ahmad: “Earlier today, Gov. Babagana Zulum of Borno State updated President @MBuhari again on latest security development in his State. “After the meeting, Gov. Zulum revealed that following the recent onslaught on insurgents by Nigerian troops, the State is now relatively peaceful.” Borno State has been the theatre of terrorism with ISWAP and Boko Haram constantly launching attacks on communities in the State.
