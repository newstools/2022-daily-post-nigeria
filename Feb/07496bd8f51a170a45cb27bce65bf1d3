The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Osun State chapter has asked the State governor, Adegboyega Oyetola to disclose the State’s debt profile. The request was made by the Osun PDP Chairman, Sunday Bisi while featuring on a radio political programme on Saturday in Osogbo. Bisi while challenging Governor Oyetola to make public to the citizens of Osun the State’s debt burden, said that the State Governor could not exonerate himself from his predecessor, Rauf Aregbesola whom he served as Chief of Staff. The Osun PDP boss stated that the role of the State Governor then as Chief Of Staff for 8 years was well documented and he was aware of all the projects the Rauf Aregbesola administration embarked upon. He also maintained that the Governor has not done anything that can sell him to the electorates and make him seek re-election. “I want to say this for record purposes. Oyetola has not done anything spectacular that can make him to be seeking for reelection. We knew what Baba Bisi Akande did when he was the governor, ditto Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola,” he said. While assuring the people that the PDP is ready to rescue the State from total collapse, the main opposition party chairman assured that come July 16, with the support of the people of Osun, PDP will take over the mantle of leadership in the State. Recall that a former Commissioner for Finance, Budget and Planning Wale Bolorunduro has some weeks back called out the Governor on the same matter. Bolorunduro also told the governor that as a former Chief of Staff under the Rauf Aregbesola administration, he was part of the government machinery and was also actively involved in the day to day running of the government operations.
