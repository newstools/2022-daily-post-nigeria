The President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick, has defended the national team’s performance at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, saying all they needed was better luck. Pinnick, in a series of tweets, insisted the players performed well in Cameroon The Super Eagles crashed out in the second round following a 1-0 defeat to Tunisia. It was a disappointing exit for Austin Eguavoen’s men who won all their group fixtures, scoring six goals in total and conceding only one. Pinnick wrote: “Good day Nigeria. First off, I would like to thank our magnificent group of players, technical team and backroom staff for their stellar work at the just concluded 33rd AFCON. We played that competition to win it, but sometimes, you also need a bit of luck. “After three wins …playing good football as well, we were unlucky in our Round of 16 match. Nevertheless, it was a brilliant showing by our team & showed the level of work the coaching crew put in. That has also been recognized by the latest @FIFAcom rankings placing Nigeria as the 3rd best on the continent.”
