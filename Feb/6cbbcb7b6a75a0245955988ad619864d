Unknown gunmen, on Thursday night, shot and killed one person while operating at Oko, Orumba North Local Government Area of Anambra State. The gunmen, who were said to have operated around 9pm, had a field day, as they operated for about 30 minutes before leaving the area. They, however, left with two persons who were said to have been taken hostage after they failed to answer questions relating to the struggle for independence by members of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB. An eyewitness, Mr Iyke Orji, who narrated the story in a social media post, said the men shot randomly, while causing a huge vehicular traffic as they operated. Orji said: “Unknown (gunmen) didn’t forgive us. About 30 mins ago, they came to Oko/Amaokpala, stopping vehicular movement coming from Ufuma and Umunze to Oko. They shot sporadically. “They gunned down an old man who they interrogated first and asked him questions relating to the (IPOB) struggle. “They stopped a Lexus 330 jeep and kidnapped the driver. A Toyota Camry (spider) was bashed. These young boys successfully carried out their operation for about 26 mins without being repelled by security agencies. “They drove away with two persons, leaving one dead at the scene,” Orji said. As at the time of filing this report, the State Police Command’s spokesperson, DSP Tochukwu Ikenga could not be reached for confirmation.
