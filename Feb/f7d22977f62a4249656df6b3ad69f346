Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, has advised youths to shun crimes and other self-defeating activities like advance fee fraud, ritual killings and drug use. The former Osun State Governor urged young Nigerians to take advantage of their time in school to seek knowledge that will equip them to be the best in chosen fields. He spoke at a programme part of the 60th anniversary of Akoko Anglican Grammar School, Arigidi Akoko (AKOGRAMS) in Ondo State. Aregbesola said the influence of the school contributed to his achievements as a professional and politician. The All Progressives Congress (APC) said schools, in the past decades, focused on structured development and grooming. “There were social nights every Saturday involving decent entertainment activities such as debates, lectures, drama, film shows and dancing”. “We had teachers who attended to the students and took them as their own children, caring but dealing strictly to instill moral values and academic knowledge. “The principal at my time was a politician, an ex-parliamentarian who would always regale us with local and international news and current affairs at each morning assembly. “He was an inspiration and a tool of God in my political evolution. AKOGRAMS moulded and formed me,” Aregbesola stated. The Minister also attributed his successes as a Governor and Minister to prayers, self-belief, total trust in God Almighty and focus on programmes aimed at transforming lives.
