Former Brighton manager, Chris Hughton, is set to replace Milovan Rajevac as the new head coach of Ghana. The Ghana Football Federation (GFA) and Sports Ministry met on Friday and decided on Hughton as Rajevac’s successor. Otto Addo was the favourite for the job, but he has now lost out to the former Premier League boss. According to Ghana Soccernet, Hughton, who travelled to Ghana to visit his family, has been approved by the government and GFA to become a substantive coach. The new development means the 63-year-old will reschedule his flight back to England. Ghana is to clash with fierce rivals, Nigeria in a 2022 FIFA World Cup playoffs next month.
