The national leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has held talks with some top Kano chieftains of the party. The parley was part of ongoing reconciliatory efforts to resolve the crisis in the State chapter. The politicians met at the Yobe Governor’s Lodge in Abuja. APC Caretaker Committee Chairman, Governor Mai Buni presided. Senators Ibrahim Shekarau, Kabiru Gaya, Jibrin Barau, House Leader, Alhassan Ado Doguwa were in attendance. Others were former House of Representatives Speaker, Yakubu Dogara and representatives of the Kano government. The participants said they were hopeful that all differences would be settled. The face-off in Kano worsened after the congress. Aggrieved members, including lawmakers, accused Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of working against them.
