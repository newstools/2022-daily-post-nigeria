The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Cross River State has dismissed the announced visit of President Muhammadu Buhari to Cross River State in the coming weeks as a plot by Governor Benedict Ayade to bolster his personal ego. Chairman of the party, Venatius Ikem, in an interview with DAILY POST in Calabar, said that lobbying for presidential visit does not amount to any achievement but sheer waste of State resources by Ayade’s administration. Ikem asked of what economic impact will the visit make to the State. “I should ask how the presidential visit to the State will impact on the State. “The huge resources required to host a Presidential visit alone is beyond his personal ego,” he said. He said the lobby to bring the President to the State arose from the Governor’s “ingrained feeling of inadequacy and inferiority complex.” Ikem said that Governor Ayade was well known for pursuing frivolities above substance, stressing that “the PDP won’t be surprised that he brings the President.” Ever since Ayade announced two days ago that President Buhari will visit the State, for the third time since 2015, there has been top preparation to receive the number one citizen.
