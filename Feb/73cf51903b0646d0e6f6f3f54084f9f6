Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, has revealed what those campaigning for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo are doing with the leaked video of Bola Tinubu, a presidential aspirant. Omokri alleged that Osinbajo’s campaigners are the ones promoting the video of Tinubu’s wet cloth. In a tweet, the former presidential aide said he could release the names of Osinbajo’s campaigners behind the leaked video. He, however, said both camps should sort themselves out. According to Omokri: “Tinubu’s camp may be surprised to learn that the embarrassing leaks about him are actually being promoted by Vice President Osinbajo’s campaigners. “We can name names if they want. Let them sort themselves out, although we appreciate them exposing their dirty linen!” Video footage had emerged on social media of the All Progressives Congress, APC, National Leader having a wet cloth. The incident was noticed and recorded while Tinubu was addressing his followers at the palace of the Awujale of Ijebuland in Ijebu Ode, Ogun State. The video had since sparked controversy among Nigerians as they insist that the former Governor of Lagos State is fit to rule Nigeria. Despite speculations of him running, Osinbajo has denied contesting for the Presidency in 2023.
