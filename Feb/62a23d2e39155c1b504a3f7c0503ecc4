Bishop David Oyedepo, founder of Living Faith Church Worldwide, has again cursed criminal elements causing havoc across the country. During a sermon, Oyedepo cursed kidnappers and their sponsors, declaring that his church members (winners) are untouchable by the assailants. The African richest pastor decreed the release of all kidnap victims in the captivity of Fulani herdsmen, saying their failure to grant their abductees freedom would lead to their (kidnappers) deaths. He said, “Kidnappers, hear this again, anyone that touches anybody called a winner loses his life to hell. I curse the root of your businesses. I curse every wicked soul patronizing you, I curse the root of every sponsor that you have. “Fulani herdsmen hear me, I know you also hear English. Anyone under your captivity now, that has this DNA in him, is released in the next seven hours, or your breath is taken from you”. DAILY POST reports that insecurity in the country has continued to worsen following the activities of armed bandits and terrorists in many parts of the nation. A few days ago, three relatives of Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State were gunned down by armed men suspected to be Fulani herdsmen.
