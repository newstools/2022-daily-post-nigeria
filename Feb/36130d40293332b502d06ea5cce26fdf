President Muhammadu Buhari, on Tuesday, said Nigerians would have been trekking the Lagos-Ibadan rail was not completed. He spoke at a meeting with a delegation from Kaduna led by Emir of Zazzau, Alhaji Ahmed Nuhu Bamalli, and Deputy Governor, Hadiza Balaraba. The President said despite dwindling resources, his resolve was to deal with infrastructure deficit. Buhari stressed that no country can advance without road, rail and power. “Nigerians are competitive by nature, and they will face their businesses when there’s road, rail and power. “The people from South-West can tell better because between Lagos and Ibadan by now, if we hadn’t done what we did, people would have been trekking. Buhari thanked international community, “China and Chinese investors, who came along to support the Lagos-Ibadan transport projects”.
