The Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere has said Nigeria could be consumed by the increasing rate of insecurity if urgent steps are not taken to bring it to an end. The National Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Jare Ajayi, in a statement alleged that the government appeared to be losing grip on how to effectively deal with the situation which he said was gradually enveloping the country. The statement expressed regret that the National Assembly members recently refused to vote in favour of state Police in the country. The group enjoined state governors and members of the states’ Houses of Assembly to pressurise President Muhammadu Buhari and the National Assembly to support state policing if they are sincere about bringing an end to the menace of insecurity and terrorism in the country. The statement read, “In the efforts to tame the monster, a lot of security personnel have lost their lives while many were wounded”. The group said the spate of security and safety infractions in the country appears like Nigeria is at war. It challenged those at the helm of affairs to be sincere in finding effective solutions to the problem. Afenifere claimed the immediate solution to ending the scourge will be to quickly allow states and local government councils have their own police units, strengthen existing security systems and motivate security personnel adequately. It added that government should also create an atmosphere for youths in the country to be productively engaged, respect the rule of law and put an end to treating terrorists and bandits with kid gloves. To make the suggested strategies enduring and effective, Afenifere called for the amendment of section 214 of the 1999 Constitution to enable states and local government councils to have their police forces.
