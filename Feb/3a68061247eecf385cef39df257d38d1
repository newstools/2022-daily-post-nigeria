Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has berated President Muhammadu Buhari for asking the National Assembly to remove clause 84(12) from the Electoral Act. Wike said Buhari’s call was aimed at protecting some of his appointees. Buhari had asked the National Assembly to remove section 84(12) of the Electoral Act because it disenfranchises serving political appointees. The president had made the call while signing the Electoral Act into law yesterday. Condemning Buhari’s call, Wike stressed that the President’s stance does not promote free and fair elections. In a statement by his spokesman, Kelvin Ebiri, the governor accused Buhari of doing the work of the judiciary by interpreting the law. He said: “Mr President has told the world he is trying to protect some of his appointees who want to run election, and who are afraid of leaving office knowing fully well that having left the office, it would be difficult for them to assert or to influence the outcome of party primaries. “If Mr President really believes in free, fair and transparent election, and for everybody to have a level playing ground, Mr President will not call for such amendment. “President is not only doing the work of the executive, he has also delved into the work of the judiciary of interpreting the law, knowing where there is conflict.”
