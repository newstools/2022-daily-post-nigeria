The Bauchi State Ministry of Education has warned proprietors of higher Islamic and Islamiyya schools against child molestation following rising cases of corporal punishment. This is even as the ministry declared that it would not hesitate to close down any of such schools found in the act and sanction the culprits accordingly. These were contained in a press statement signed by the acting Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Sule Adamu Madara, on behalf of the State Commissioner of Education and made available to journalists in Bauchi. According to the statement, the increasing cases of corporal punishment among the schools was increasingly causing bodily harm and often resulted in the death of innocent pupils placed under the care of schools. While saying that proprietors of the schools should warn their teachers against such acts, the ministry advised them to devise appropriate disciplinary measures on their erring pupils or students in conformity with laid down principles and rules of engagements in the teaching profession. “In view of the foregoing, the Ministry of Education as a supervisory body of all educational institutions and child caregivers centres in the state is advising the proprietors of private, higher Islamic and Islamiyya schools to seriously warn their teachers to desist from this unhealthy behaviour. “This nonchalant attitude is increasingly causing bodily harm and often result in the death of the innocent pupils placed under the care of schools in Bauchi. “Equally, the proprietors are also advised to devise appropriate disciplinary measures on their erring pupils or students in conformity with laid down principles and rules of engagements in the teaching profession rather than adopting corporal punishment which has been banned in all public schools in the state,” the ministry stated. It then added that it would continue to monitor schools until when such dangerous behaviours are eliminated.
