The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) told DAILY POST that the accident occurred around 5:50am at the Ogere section of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway. The spokesperson of the FRSC in Ogun State, Florence Okpe, said six persons, four men and two women, were involved in the accident. According to Okpe, a woman and two men sustained injuries, while the remaining three died. “03 persons were injured (02 male adults and 01 female adult). 03 persons were recorded dead from the crash (02 males and 01 female),” Okpe said. She explained that a Volkswagen marked, GGE175 FM, had rammed into a Mack truck with no registration number on it. “The suspected cause of the fatal crash was road obstruction and speed. The road obstruction was caused by the Mack truck that was stationed and the Volkwagen lost control due to excessive speed and rammed into the stationed truck.” “The three injured victims were taken to General hospital Isara. The female corpse was deposited at FOS Ipara, while the other corpses were taken away by their family members,” she added. Meanwhile, the Sector Commander has described the road crash as avoidable, warning motorists against too much speed.
