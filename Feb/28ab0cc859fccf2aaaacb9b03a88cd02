Youths in the Southwest zone of the All Progressives Congress have urged the party’s national leadership to provide them with greater opportunities to serve the party and country. The Southwest APC youths stated that much work remained to be done in order to get the country to the promised land. The youths addressed journalists in Akure over the results of the just-completed Leadership Sensitization and Capacity Building workshop, which took place in Oyo State. Kolade Lawal Paff, the Southwest APC’s Zonal Youth Leader, said the work needed excellent technical abilities to get Nigeria to the promised land. Paff, who urged leaders to reaffirm their commitment to the development of youth potential, explained that it was the sum of the individual efforts that made the difference. He claimed that the APC had made significant gains since 2015, but that the party could perform even better if it harnessed more of the youths’ vigor and enthusiasm. In his own words, “We need to find a way to combine the knowledge of the elderly with the might of the young. There is still much work to be done in order for Nigeria to reach the Promised Land. These projects necessitate a high level of technical expertise, and we must prepare ourselves as the nation’s future strength. “We demand that additional opportunities for service be provided to us, and we must ensure that we fulfill those possibilities. Hon. Afeez Bolaji Repete, the APC’s Deputy National Youth Leader, said the gathering was important for bringing together a large number of APC leaders and reaffirming their commitment to the party’s vision for Nigeria.
