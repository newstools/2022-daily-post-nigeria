Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp has described Sadio Mane as “absolutely insane” following their 3-1 victory over Norwich in the Premier League on Saturday. Mane netted for the Reds as they stayed within six points away from leaders, Manchester City. Norwich opened scoring at Anfield when Milot Rashica’s deflected shot beat Alisson in the hosts’ goal. However, Mane’s bicycle kick levelled matters in the 64th minute. It was his 106th goal for the club and 83rd in the Premier League. Mohamed Salah and Luis Diaz completed the comeback for the former champions with nine minutes to go. “Oh, definitely [Mane is a club legend]; [His] goal record is absolutely insane as well and the goal he scored today [Saturday] maybe shows the whole range of the things he can do,” Klopp told the club’s site. “He helped the team today massively with first playing in the centre, then going back to the left-wing, then being in the right moment in the centre, then doing a bicycle kick. Sadio has more than 100 goals as well. “He is a world-class striker wherever he will play: left-wing, right-wing, centre. He is a world-class striker and yes, it’s really helpful to have him here,” Klopp said.
