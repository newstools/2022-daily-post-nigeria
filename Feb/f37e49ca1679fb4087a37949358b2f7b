Former Ukraine captain, Andriy Shevchenko, has pleaded with countries around the world to support his nation following the Russian invasion. The former Chelsea and AC Milan striker insisted that his family and people are under attack. Recall that Russian President Vladimir Putin declared war on Ukraine on Thursday morning, launching a full-scale military invasion of his country’s neighbour. Russian missiles, tanks and warplanes targeted airports, military bases and cities in Ukraine, with air raid sirens also heard in the capital Kyiv. Reacting to the development, Shevchenko said that Ukraine only wants peace and war is not the answer. “In the early hours a full scale war was initiated by Russia. My people and my family are under attack,” Shevchenko wrote on Twitter. “Ukraine and its population want peace and territorial integrity. “Please I ask you to support our country and call the Russian government to stop their aggression and violation of international law. “We only want peace. War is not the answer.”
