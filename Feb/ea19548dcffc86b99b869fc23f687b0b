The Urhobo ethnic nationality has signed the Niger Delta Peoples Charter on resource control and self-determination. Niger Delta Congress (NDC) spokesman, Ovunda Eni made the announcement in a terse statement on Friday. Eni confirmed that Chief Vincent Oyibode signed the charter in Warri, the Delta capital. Oyibode is the Commissioner representing Urhobo at the Delta State Oil Producing Areas Commission (DESOPADEC). In January, the Ijaw ethnic group endorsed the charter through His Royal Majesty, King Frank Okiakpe, Agadagba X of Gbaraun Kingdom. Last November, Engr. Olu Andah Wai-Ogosu (representing Rivers), ex-President of Nigeria Environmental Society (NES) gave his approval. His assent followed that of Emeritus Prof Ebiegberi Joe Alagoa (representing Bayelsa), elder statesman and a retired University of Lagos (UNILAG) lecturer. The NDC is collating signatures from Niger Delta nationalities, organisations and all South-South states. The organization and allies are demanding that oil and other natural resources be controlled by the people.
