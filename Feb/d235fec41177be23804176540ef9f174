The Chairman, Senate Committee on National Population and National Identity, Senator Sahabi Alhaji Yaú (APC Zamfara North), has disclosed the plan of the Federal Government to deploy the use of technology for the forthcoming national census. The Federal Government had allocated over N190 billion for the conduct of the 2022 census in this year’s budget. Speaking during the screening of President Muhammadu Buhari’s nominees as Federal Commissioners in the National Population Commission, NPC, in Abuja, the lawmaker, said the 2022 census would be a complete departure from the previous exercises ever had in the country. Senator Yau, who was a former Deputy Minority Whip, maintained that the forthcoming national headcount would be technologically driven. He said the screening of the nominees became necessary in order to enable them to contribute to the success of the census. Asked if the timing for the census was ideal due to the rising waves of insecurity in the country, he said President Muhammadu Buhari and his cabinet know better on the choice of time for the conduct of the exercise. According to him, foreign partners would be involved in the exercise to help the commission in the deployment of technology. Some of the nominees are Barrister Patricia Orikuchi representing Benue State, Dr Aliru Bala from Kebbi State and Eyitayo Olatunji from Ekiti State. Fielding questions from committee members, Dr Bala, a lecturer at the University of Port Harcourt, said the coming census would enable Nigeria to have accurate figures and guide against speculations, adding that the census would be used for national planning. Also, Barrister Orikuchi, who was nominated for the second term, disclosed that the commission is 90 percent ready for the exercise, noting that the morale of the staff of the commission is boosted ahead of the proposed headcount. The NPC had earlier said it is waiting for the President to proclaim when the activities will commence.
