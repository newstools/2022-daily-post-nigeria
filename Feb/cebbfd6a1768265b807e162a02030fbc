Lagos State Head of Service, Hakeem Muri-Okunola, has debunked claims that he was a nursing a governorship ambition. Some political forces and state elders are reportedly backing him to succeed Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu in 2023. The speculations circulated late January, a development that forced the All Progressives Congress (APC) elders to issue a rebuttal. In a statement, Muri-Okunola denied a secret plan to, along with others, deny Sanwo-Olu a second term. The lawyer reiterated his support for the current administration’s plan to develop good policies and infrastructure. Muri-Okunola accused fifth columnists of trying to create a conflict between him and the governor. “I reiterate my support for Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and his administration’s THEMES Agenda – the six-pillar development plan that is the compass for his projects and policies. “I am fully focused on carrying out my duties as head of service of the Lagos state government and taking the Public Service to greater heights”, he wrote. The 50-year-old warned mischief makers to stop creating confusion by playing the religion card. Muri-Okunola, a Tinubu protégé with a wide support base, is the first son of the late Justice Muritala Okunola. He was Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Youth and Social Development; Executive Secretary, Land Use and Allocation Committee between 2005 and 2011.
