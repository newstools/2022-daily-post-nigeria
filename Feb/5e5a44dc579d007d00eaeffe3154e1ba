Prophet Bisi Olujobi, the General Overseer of Wisdom Church International, Ketu, Lagos State, has warned he sees a shameful end of Primate Elijah Ayodele. He also said leading pastors in the country such as Pastor W. F Kumuyi of Deeper Life Church; Pastor Enoch Adeboye of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, have limited time on earth. The cleric said that the ministries of Bishop David Oyedepo and Primate Ayodele will face great danger in the running year. He said these men should hand over to the younger generation because they “are all having their last revival.They should tidy up their house and hand over to the younger generation as their time on earth is limited,” Bisi Olujobi said in a statement he signed and made available to DAILY POST on Friday. He continued, “The likes of Bishop David Oyedepo, Primate Ayodele Elijah Babatunde, will both face stiff opposition that will bring a dagger to their ministry. “Babatunde especially, should run to God for cover for I see his ministry coming to a shameful end.” “The likes of Pastor Kumuyi, Pastor Adeboye, Prophet Olowore, are all having their last revival, they should tidy up their house and handover to the younger generation as their time on earth is limited,” he said.
