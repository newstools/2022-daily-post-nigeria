Prophet Bisi Olujobi, the General Overseer of Wisdom Church International, Ketu, Lagos State, has said he foresees a major plane crash in Nigeria this year. He warned that Africa’s richest businessman, Aliko Dangote, could contract what he described as a “strange illness that could scatter his business.” Olujobi further warned the founder of the Love of Christ Generation Church in Lagos, Prophetess Esther Ajayi, saying that there would be a spiritual gang up against her. “On the issue of safety, Nigeria airspace operators should be full of prayers in the year 2022,” he said in a series of prophecies he made available to DAILY POST on Friday. He said he saw “a major crash that will affect a commercial Airline, except serious prayer is made to avert such.” He revealed that, “Alhaji Aliko Dangote should pray against a strange illness that will scatter his business empire.” On Prophetess Ajayi, he said the cleric must be “more prayerful and careful”, adding that he “foresees a spiritual gang-up against her and her ministry. “The woman should immediately embark on an intense prayer and fasting if she wants to last in the ministry.” I foresee State of Emergency, delayed 2023 election in Nigeria – Primate Ayodele warns Buhari
