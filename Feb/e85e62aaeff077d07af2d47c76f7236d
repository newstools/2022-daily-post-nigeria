Four persons died on Sunday afternoon in a fatal accident, which occurred on the Bauchi-Kano road, while seven others sustained varying degrees of injuries in the accident. Information from the Bauchi State Sector Command of the Federal Roads Safety Corps (FRSC) revealed that two commercial vehicles, an Opel Vectra and Sharon mini bus, in opposite directions had a head-on collision at Sabongari village at about 3pm. The corps disclosed that three people died on the spot of the accident, while another died at the Bauchi Specialist’s Hospital in Bauchi, adding that those injured were being treated at the trauma centre of the hospital. It was gathered that the victims were evacuated from the scene of the accident by a team of special and regular Corps Marshalls who responded to distress calls. The corps attributed the accident to over speeding and dangerous driving, which led to the bursting of the front tyre of the Opel Vectra forcing it to swerve to the other lane to collide with the oncoming Sharon mini bus. Meanwhile, three of the injured victims confirmed to be stable, including a male child, have since been discharged from the hospital.
