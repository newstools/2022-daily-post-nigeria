Tottenham Hotspur manager, Antonio Conte, has revealed his game plan which saw them beat Manchester City 3-2 in the Premier League on Saturday. Spurs took the lead through Kulusevski in the fourth minute of the game. City levelled before the break as captain Ilkay Gundogan stabbed home from close range. Kane finished off a Heung-Min Son pass as Antonio Conte’s men retook the lead, but Riyad Mahrez fired home a stoppage-time penalty. There was enough time for Kane to head home the winner at the Etihad. Conte has admitted they were happy to concede possession to City and take their chances on the counter-attack. “It was an emotional game for sure, it was an exciting game. “We played a good game. We followed a plan. Manchester City would keep possession for 65 to 70 minutes for the game so we needed to be good tactically. But even when defending our first thought should be to attack. “We created chances and scored good goals against a fantastic team. This win will give us more confidence. It wasn’t simple to play Manchester City after three losses in a row,” Conte said.
