The leadership of the National Rescue Movement Party, Bayelsa State Chapter, says henceforth, the party no longer exists in the State. It said the Party’s structure had been collapsed into the ruling Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP). This was officially made known on Thursday by the State Chairman, Mr. Kenny K. Amgbare, who led other executive members and major stakeholders of the party to the office of the Special Adviser to the Bayelsa Governor on Political Matters, in Yenagoa. Amgbare highlighted the developmental strides and leadership style of His Excellency, Senator Douye Diri, as some of the reasons that informed their decision to join the PDP. Receiving them into the PDP, the Special Adviser on Political Matters, High Chief Collins Cocodia, who was accompanied by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Inter Party Relations, Hon. Suokiri Jackson, said that their step was in the right direction. The Political Adviser reiterated the open door policy of Gov. Diri and reemphasized that “project Bayelsa must not suffer, as we are first Bayelsans before political parties, hence, the need for all to come together to support the Miracle Governor.” Cocodia also noted that they should see themselves as bonafide members of the PDP, and also bring their wealth of experience for the success of the party.
