Veteran Nollywood actor, Richard Mofe-Damijo has expressed concern for small Nigerian businesses over fuel scarcity across the country. The importation of millions of litres of adulterated fuel into Nigeria, as claimed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, disrupted the fuel supply across the country. The situation has led to scarcity, along with long queues at filling stations and untold hardships to Nigerians who have to trek long distance to reach their destinations. RMD, reacting, said the past couple of days have been draining due to scarcity of fuel, hike in diesel and almost non-existence of power supply. In a post on his Instagram page, the actor sympathized with small businesses who are finding it difficult to thrive in Nigeria due to the situation. His post read: “These past couple of days have been draining in between scarcity of fuel hike in price of diesel and almost non existent power supply. “ I can’t help but feel so sorry for small businesses who can barely survive and need these basic necessities to thrive.” Meanwhile, the NNPC, while apologizing to Nigerians, promised that regular supply of petrol will return to normalcy in a few days.
