Chelsea could be set to be without one of their major players, Mason Mount, during the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup due to injury. Mount hobbled off with an injury during Chelsea’s FA Cup fourth round 2-1 win against Plymouth Argyle on Saturday. The England international started the clash against Plymouth Argyle at Stamford Bridge only to be withdrawn in the 96th minute of the encounter. Mount was eventually replaced by fellow midfielder Saul Niguez. At the time of Mount’s substitution, the scores were level at 1-1 after Macaulay Gillesphey and Cesar Azpilicueta had scored for their teams. But Mount’s withdrawal did not hamper Chelsea as they managed to finally edge the League One outfit 2-1 during the first half of extra-time, thanks to Marcos Alonso’s goal. Chelsea travel to Abu Dhabi later next week, where they will be playing in this year’s FIFA Club World Cup as Mount will now hope to recover on time before the competition starts.
