President Muhammadu Buhari has pledged the Federal Government’s readiness to honour existing agreements with the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). Beyond the agreement, Buhari said the pact with ASUU is in a bid to prevent disruptive strikes, engender uninterrupted academic programmes and shore up funding of educational institutions. The President made the pledge on Tuesday in Abuja while receiving members of the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council (NIREC), led by the co-chairs, the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar; and the President of the Christian Association of Nigeria, Rev. Dr. Samson Olasupo Ayokunle. He lauded the leadership of NIREC for intervening in the year-long strike by ASUU, noting that no society which wishes itself well neglects its educational system and all its component parts. Recall that members of ASUU have repeatedly threatened to resume their strike over alleged nonchalance to meet existing agreements. Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, was recently quoted to have said the Federal Government entered into most of the agreements with tertiary-based unions under duress.
