Ahead of the July 16, 2022, Osun gubernatorial election, all the participating political parties have been charged to scrutinize individuals to be presented as candidates. This charge was handed down by Wasiu Oyedokun Alli, Group Executive Director, The Osun Masterminds, a socio-political group, while interacting with journalists in Osogbo on Saturday. Alli, who said governance in Osun State was beyond the theatrics of archaic politicking, singing and dancing, added that it should be more about debate of ideas. Acknowledging that leadership in the 22nd century is about wholesome sustainable development and not petty socialism, Alli said The Osun Masterminds was against entrenching politics of stomach infrastructure. The group noted that candidates for political offices must be considered on the strength of their mental and leadership capacities. “We also must note that the era of rice and beans politics should rightly be over and must not be re-entrenched. “Candidates must be considered on the strength of their mental and leadership capacities, and not by the amount of bags of rice that they have distributed. Leadership in the 21st century is now about wholesome sustainable development and not petty socialism. “Leadership in the 21st century is about innovative ideas and problem solving. Heads of government at all levels are now required to think outside the box to deliver development to their people, despite the global hardships in recent times,” he said. The group called on aspiring leaders to have minimum qualification, which guarantees the soundness of their minds, adding that ensuring such was the first step towards placing Osun on the path of honour in the comity of States.
