The Osun Police Command has vowed to use all legitimate means to avert any form of protest under any guise, especially during this electioneering period in the state. The state’s Commissioner of Police, Wale Olokode, on Tuesday, said the command has intel that some groups of people are planning to embark on protest in the state. Warning the individual or group of individuals that are planning such in the state, the police boss in a statement by the command’s spokesperson, SP Yemisi Opalola, appealed to parents and guardians to warn their children and wards to stay out of trouble during this period of elections. He warned, “individual or group of individuals that are planning such in the state and their sponsor(s) jettison the plan or any of such action(s) forthwith because the Command frowns at any form of protest under any guise, especially this electioneering period in the state and is fully prepared to use all legitimate means to avert such intending protest.” While guaranteeing security on a level playing ground for all political parties, politicians and all the eligible electorates to exercise their franchise from the police and other security agencies, Olokode vowed that the security agency will not hesitate to deal with anyone or group of persons attempting to foment trouble and in the process disrupt the smooth conduct of the elections decisively and within the ambit of the law. “War-mongers, troublemakers, persons, group or groups intending or planning to cause, create or execute any act of violence before, during and after the primary/gubernatorial elections should, in their own interest, leave the state quietly and peacefully. “They should not allow themselves to be used by any vicious politicians to cause a crisis in the State as the command will not tolerate any kind of thuggery, gangsterism and hooliganism. “Though all allegations and counter-allegations are not unexpected, it is pertinent to state clearly here, that the police is apolitical, and we will discharge our duties without bias or favour to any person or persons regardless of their political affiliation,” the statement read.
