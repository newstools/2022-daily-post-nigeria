The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor E. A Adeboye has prophesied that the glory of North-East Nigeria and other parts troubled by terrorists and insurgents will be restored. Adeboye said this in a Facebook post on Saturday, after the ‘Light Up Nigeria’ outreach in Gombe State. The event was organised as part of activities to mark the cleric’s 80th birthday. “The Glory of the North-Eastern Part of Nigeria will be restored by God’s grace. “I use Gombe State as a point of contact: that as the light of God came down powerfully during the @reach4christ Crusade, the light of God will descend upon every troubled part of our dear Nation Nigeria,” Adeboye wrote.
