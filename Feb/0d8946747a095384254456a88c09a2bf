The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, has said that he needs more strength psychologically than physically, to be president in 2023. He stated this when he visited the palace of the Ataoja of Osogbo, Jimoh Olanipekun, to inform him of his political ambition on Friday. There have been concerns from observers over Tinubu’s health status, following his recent medical trip to the United Kingdom. However, Tinubu said: “I am not applying for the job of bricklaying or grave digging. I went to school to study accountancy and management. “I am applying for a thinking job and I will do it right. The job I want to do is for Nigeria to be greater and to be proud of itself.” In his remarks, the Ataoja of Osogbo said Tinubu has the capacity to be Nigeria’s president, and prayed that God would grant his heart’s desires.
