The former Governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari has said he was not terribly ill as reported in some sections of the media. He, however, confirmed that he had a leg dislocation and had to travel out of the country to seek medical treatment. Yari, one of the national chairmanship aspirants in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) disclosed this in a statement issued Saturday by his Chief of Staff, Mr. Abdullahi Tsafe. The APC chieftain said there was no need to blow the incident out of proportion as it is natural with humans to fall sick, He described the media report as nothing but the ‘ranting of an enemy.’ His words: “Let us make it abundantly clear that, H.E had a dislocation on his left leg when he missed steps on the staircase as a result of which he travelled to the United States for treatment; from where he came back last two weeks and has today left for medical checkup. That does not call for any media hype. “Therefore, the general public, teeming supporters and his well-wishers are enjoined to ignore the ranting and evil machinations of some very few and selfish individuals who are bent on distracting former Governor Yari. “As we pray for his safe trip, His Excellency is expected back home after his medical checkup soon.”
