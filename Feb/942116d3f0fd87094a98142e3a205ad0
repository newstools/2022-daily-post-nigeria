In the aftermath of the FCT council polls that took place on Saturday across the nation’s capital, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Hon. Azubuike Egbu, has warned the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) not to tamper with results from the chairmanship election in the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC). INEC’s returning officer, Prof. Sanni Saka, had on Sunday, declared the PDP candidate, Mr Christopher Zakka as the winner of the elections. Zakka polled a total of 19,302 to defeat his closest rival, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Murtal Usman, who polled 13,240 votes. But the incumbent Vice Chairman of AMAC, Hon. Lawrence Onuchukwu, who stood in as the collation agent of the APC, told Prof. Saka not to declare the PDP candidate. According to him, there were irregularities in some polling units during the elections and that, declaring the PDP candidate winner would subject the process to a credibility test. But Hon. Azubuike, who is also a Senior Special Assistant to the Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, in a statement on Sunday, supported his principal’s earlier call by the Governor, warning INEC not to tamper with AMAC results. He said, “any attempt by INEC to tamper with the already declared results of AMAC chairmanship elections shall be vehemently resisted by all well-meaning people of the Council Area, who thronged out to vote for PDP.” Hon. Egbu, with his team of supporters, who have been in Abuja for the past four days campaigning for his party (PDP), went around the FCT to sensitize Igbos in Abuja and enlighten them on the need to vote for the party.
