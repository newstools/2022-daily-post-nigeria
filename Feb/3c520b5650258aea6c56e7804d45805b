Eight persons have reportedly been kidnapped in Madauchi village near Birnin Yero community in Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna State. A resident of the area who spoke to DAILY POST in Kaduna on Monday, Mallam Nasir Ibrahim said the area has become a den of criminals in recent times. He said seven people were murdered by bandits at Ungwan Mallam, in the same community two days ago, wondering what attracted criminals to the community. “In this community, there are no rich men. We are all peasant farmers who eat from hand to mouth. Many residents in our community are finding it difficult to have even one meal a day. Yet, criminals, bandits have been terrorising our community.” A community leader who confirmed the kidnapping, Suleman Abdullahi said, the bandits on Sunday night started shooting sporadically. Many residents, because of the gunshots, ran into the bush while the bandits injured others and forced them into their vehicle. He said since the villagers were taken away, nothing has been heard from the bandits or the victims. He called on security agents to beam their searchlights in the area as criminals often terrorise the residents of the community. The Kaduna Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige did not pick his calls to confirm the incident and did not respond to text messages sent to him.
