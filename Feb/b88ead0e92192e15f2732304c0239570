President Muhammadu Buhari has appointed Mohammed Bello-Koko as substantive Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) Managing Director, effectively sacking suspended MD, Hadiza Usman. The Federal Ministry of Transportation made the announcement on Tuesday in a circular signed by Eric Ojiekwe, Director of Public Relations. “Prior to this appointment, Koko was the Executive Director, Finance & Administration of NPA”, the statement reads. In Panama Papers, Bello-Koko Koko is accused of purchasing some properties in the United Kingdom through offshore businesses in the British Virgin Islands Born on 25th March 1969, he attended the University of Sokoto for his first degree in Management Studies (B.Sc) in 1992. In 1995, Bello-Koko obtained a Master’s degree in Business Administration (MBA) in 1995 at the Usman Dan Fodio University. He worked at FSB International Bank Plc and rose to the position of Senior Banking Officer-Senior Treasury Officer, Senior Banking Officer-Energy Sector (ENSEC). The NPA MD joined Zenith Bank Plc in 2005 as a Manager-Team Head, Public Sector and Large Corporate and attained higher positions. Last year June, Buhari suspended Usman and ordered the probe of her leadership. The Nigerian leader’s directive followed alleged infractions including a controversial contract award and non-remittances.
