Tottenham Hotspur manager, Antonio Conte has said his team are playing like relegation strugglers. The Italian stated this following a 1-0 loss at Burnley on Wednesday night. Ben Mee headed in the only goal of the game in the 71st minute, as Spurs slumped to a fourth defeat in five Premier League games. Conte’s men now sit in eighth place with 39 points from 24 games. “In the last five games, we are playing like we are in relegation, this is the reality. “I want to try to improve the situation and also to make an assessment with the club. If we continue in this way, maybe we have to pay great attention, because in this league, we can finish 10th, 12th, 13th — the same way when I arrived here, the same position,” Conte said after the game.
