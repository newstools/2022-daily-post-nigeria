Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola, has identified Bernardo Silva as a “perfect player” after the midfielder scored a brace in his side’s Champions League round of 16 first-leg 5-0 win over Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday night in Portugal. Man City were dominant from start to finish as two goals from Silva and a strike each from Raheem Sterling, Phil Foden and Riyad Mahrez ensured Guardiola’s side thrashed Sporting. “I always tell him [Silva] ‘you are the perfect player’,” Guardiola said at his post-match press conference. “With the ball, he is more than exceptional, but I always say to him you have to go and win games, you have to have the ability to do it. He has the technique, everything. “This was his hometown, and he loves coming back here. Of course, he is a former Benfica player, so this was special for him tonight.” He added, “The performance could have been better. The difference between the two teams is not 0-5, but we were just so clinical. “If we do go through to the quarterfinals, who knows what will happen. Last season we made a perfect Champions League season, then we lost the final. Then we are seen as a failure. I will not hide behind a 5-0 win, there is a long way to go.” Man City will face Sporting in the second-leg in England in March
