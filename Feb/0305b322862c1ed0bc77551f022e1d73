Three persons were reportedly killed and several others abducted in communities in Gulbin Boka district of Mariga Local Government Area of Niger State by suspected terrorists. DAILY POST learnt that during the attacks that occurred on Tuesday, the gunmen killed three persons, and kidnapped several others. The terrorists were also said to have burnt down many homes, rustled animals as well as carted away food stuffs. It was gathered that the terrorists, who stormed the Gulbin-Boka village on 97 motorcycles that caused the locals to scamper for safety to the mountain top as they watched the havoc being unleashed by the gunmen on their community. Eyewitness accounts stated that while on the mountain, they saw the gunmen armed with dangerous weapons on their motorcycles heading towards Shadadi, a town north of Gulbin Boka. Confirming the incident, Hon. Isa A. Mohammed, councillor representing Gulbin Boka ward in Mariga local government, said the terrorists invaded his village and rained mayhem on Tuesday. According to him, “I don’t know the fate of my family presently. My people, who are mostly women and children, are still on top of the mountain hiding and unable to come down out of fear. “What we really need now is the presence of security agents to enable our people to have the confidence to climb down to gather what is left for them so that they could get something to eat.” The councillor revealed that the villagers in Kuimo and Muhoro in the same Gulbin Boka district were badly affected communities with no one currently living there. “Anyone who was not killed or kidnapped escaped only by climbing up the mountain during the attacks,” he added. The state Commissioner for Local Government, Community Development and Internal Security, Hon. Emmanuel Umar, when contacted, stated that he was yet to get a full brief on the development in the area.
