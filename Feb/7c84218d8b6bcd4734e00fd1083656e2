The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) Federal University Wukari branch has resolved to go by the resolutions that will be reached by the national secretariat of the union. The resolution, as observed by DAILY POST, was reached at the congress meeting of the union, which took place on Thursday at the university premises in Wukari Local Government Council of Taraba State. In a statement made available to newsmen shortly after the congress, the branch chairman of ASUU, Joseph Ikwebe, said the institution declared Wednesday a lecture free-day in order to enlighten students and parents about the plights of ASUU. The union, as stated by him, will remain committed and abide by the decision of ASUU national Secretariat concerning the next line of action. “It is more than a year since the union patriotically suspended the nine months strike action occasioned by the failure of the federal government to implement the 2009 agreement and numbers of memoranda of understanding, the statement said. The union, which also acknowledged the recent interventions of some notable stakeholders, however, expressed dismay at the alleged refusal of the federal government to do the needful in order to dissuade ASUU from paralysing academic activities. Some of the issues they claimed are contentions include enactment of law to prevent proliferation of state universities, funding for revitalisation of public universities. Others as made known by them are the signing and implementation of the renegotiated draft 2009 agreement, University Transparency and Accountability Solutions (UTAS), Earned Academic Allowances, among others.
