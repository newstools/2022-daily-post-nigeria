The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Zamfara State has endorsed the presidential ambition of Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal. The exco led by Col. Bala Mande (rtd.), noted that since “Sokoto PDP and Zamfara PDP are one”, Tambuwal is their preference. The governor was in the state on Monday as he commenced his consultations across the 36 states in Nigeria. Zamfara State Deputy Governor, Mahdi Aliyu, who refused to join Governor Bello Matawalle to the All Progressives Congress (APC), received him. The former House of Representatives Speaker explained that his mission was to seek the support of state leaders, members and citizens. Tambuwal told the gathering that he won’t speak openly on the impeachment process by the House of Assembly against Aliyu. The aspirant thanked the hosts for the endorsement, urging the people to close ranks and not be deterred by the challenges. Tambuwal condoled with them over the killings, kidnapping and general insecurity in the state. In his remarks, Aliyu declared that Zamfara State PDP will stand strong for the governor’s 2023 presidential ambition. Tambuwal was accompanied by former Governor, Attahairu Bafarawa, ex-Deputy Governor and ex-Minister, Muktah Shagari, ex-Minister Bello Sulaiman, among others.
