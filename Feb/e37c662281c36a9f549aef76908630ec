A political group, Generation Next Collective (GNC) has charged the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to zone its 2023 presidential ticket. A statement by co-conveners, Ruth Edehemon and Rufai Abdulahi, urged the party to act quickly and be more explicit about its path in the race. The organization made the call on Friday while declaring support for Sokoto Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal. The former House of Representatives Speaker has commenced nationwide consultations with PDP state leaders and members. GNC noted that Nigerians expect the general elections next year to answer some questions bordering on equity, justice and inclusion. The body described the PDP as a democratic party that should not shy away from “this conversation that is rooted in fairness and truth”. It maintained that the South and North are deserving of fair play and inclusion, “a democratic feature “unwittingly starved by the government in power”. The GNC urged the PDP to address “the lingering ambiguity” over which zone the presidential candidate should come from, build an honest, purpose-driven and robust consensus. “Incontrovertible records show that the party has managed the affairs of the nation at the presidency for 16 years. It is a fact that the South held sway for over 14 years. “Rather than this silence eliciting seeming confusion, the party should speak up, bring its leaders from the North and South together, address their sentiments, do negotiations and present a united front.” The statement advised the PDP to settle for someone with less controversy, negative public sentiments and vigour for the demanding job of president.
