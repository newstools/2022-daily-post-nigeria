The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Senator Iyorchia Ayu, has alleged that President Muhammadu Buhari is reluctant in signing the re-worked Electoral Bill because the All Progressives Congress, APC, is afraid of losing the forthcoming 2023 general elections. Ayu, who spoke on Thursday in Jos, the Plateau State capital, urged members of the party to be adequately prepared for the election by securing their Permanent Voters Card, PVC. He expressed optimism that they party would takeover leadership of the country in 2023 to savage the nation from the alleged bad governance of the current administration. The former senate president, called on party members in Plateau to ensure that PDP wins governorship election in the state. “I want everyone to work together and bring back all our members who were angry and left PDP. “Plateau is the home of PDP, we must work together to return to power and save the country. I don’t want Plateau to be in opposition when we win the election at the federal. “You must do the right thing, get your PVC, and vote. Our votes will count, that is why the APC doesn’t want electoral reforms. “President Buhari must sign the electoral act immediately, that will make elections impossible to rig…”
