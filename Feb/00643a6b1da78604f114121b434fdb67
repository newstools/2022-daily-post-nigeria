Former Manchester City striker, Sergio Aguero, has slammed French media for ‘killing’ Paris Saint-Germain forward, Lionel Messi. Aguero said this while defending Messi after the seven-time Ballon d’ Or winner was slammed for his poor performance during PSG’s Champions League round of 16 first-leg 1-0 victory against Real Madrid on Tuesday. Messi was handed just a three out of 10 rating by French outlet, L’Equipe, for his ‘worrying’ limp display after his dramatic penalty miss against Real Madrid during the encounter. The former Barcelona captain failed to convert from 12 yards when handed a spot-kick against Real Madrid, with goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois saving his effort. But Kylian Mbappe scored a late goal to ensure PSG defeated the Los Blancos in Paris. “What s**t this Leo penalty story. He played well, broke lines. He was good and very active,” Aguero told RMC Sport. “In France, magazines and newspapers killed him. They are a******s.”#
