Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has alleged that Raymond Dokpesi, founder of Daar Communications, who is a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, is working for the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC. Wike stated this on Thursday while reacting to rumours that himself and other PDP governors were in Europe to determine the presidential and vice candidates of the party in the forthcoming 2023 general elections. The Governor alleged that Raymond Dokpesi was the conveyor of the rumour, stressing that his aim was to bring down the governors to pave way for the former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar. He lamented why some members of the opposition party would create division among the governors, saying the party is being rebuilt to take over power in 2023. He said, “I have some suspicion that people like Raymond Dokpesi are not really sincere to the Peoples Democratic Party and I think I’m convinced that Raymond Dokpesi appears to be working for APC. “I don’t understand where Raymond Dokpesi gets this information, this rumour that governors travelled to Europe to decide who will be the presidential candidate and vice presidential candidate of PDP. I wonder why governors will travel to Europe to take such a decision.” He warned Dokpesi against destroying the governors in the name of preaching for the 2019 presidential candidate, Atiku, saying doing so would make the party lose the presidency in 2023.
