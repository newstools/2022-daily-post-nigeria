President Muhammadu Buhari, on Wednesday, said Nigerians in the northeast would, in the coming months, witness a change from protracted insurgency to peace and development in their respective communities. Buhari spoke at the inauguration of the Presidential Committee on the Repatriation, Return and Resettlement of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in the North-East of Nigeria, which preceded the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting. He announced that his administration is embarking on a revised approach to addressing the 13-year conflict and insurgency in the region and will not relent in its efforts towards a return to peace and normalcy. A statement by his spokesman, Femi Adesina, quoted Buhari as saying: ”At the advent of this administration in 2015, I pledged to Nigerians that I will restore peace in the North East and return it to the path of development and growth. I remain committed to this promise. ”To the people of the North-East, particularly the children and future of the North-East, we will never forget you and your courage, sacrifice and endurance have been exemplary. ”I pledge to you that in the coming months, you will begin to witness a shift away from a protracted insurgency to peacebuilding, stabilization, and ultimately development in your respective communities as we embark on a revised approach to addressing this conflict- A Return to Normalcy.”
