Egypt assistant coach, Diyaa El-Sayed, has revealed how captain, Mohamed Salah, reacted to the Pharaohs’ 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, final defeat against Senegal on Sunday night. El-Sayed said Salah was ‘disappointed’ after Egypt’s AFCON final defeat to Senegal in Cameroon. He explained that the Liverpool star experienced Egypt’s 4-2 penalty defeat to Senegal just like an ‘ordinary person’. Salah was unable to save Egypt as they were defeated on penalties following a 0-0 draw in Yaoundé’s Olembé stadium. “Salah is a great world-class player, but his attitude is the attitude of an ordinary person,” El-Sayed, who was standing in for Egypt head coach, Carlos Queiroz, told GOAL. “When you lose, you have the feelings of loss, and that’s what we felt [on Sunday].” “We were determined, determined to win, keen to participate and succeed,” El-Sayed added. “He’s played in major European competitions and won many honours, but he really wanted to win this cup for the country. “We now want to qualify for the World Cup with him. “Salah is like any other captain of any other team, and he’s really disappointed because he really wanted to achieve his goal in this competition.”
