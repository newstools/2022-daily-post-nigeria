U.S. airplane manufacturer, Boeing has suspended parts, maintenance and technical support for Russian airlines as the effect of sanctions in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine ripple across the global aviation industry. Boeing, on Tuesday, announced that it had halted major operations in its Moscow office and temporarily closed another office in Kyiv, Ukraine. The company also said that it had ceased providing parts, maintenance and technical support services to Russian airlines. In recent days, Russia has been sanctioned by countries around the world. Boeing has an operation that includes a major design center in Moscow, runs a flight training campus and has a joint venture in Russia with VSMPO-AVISMA, Boeing’s largest titanium supplier. Another US manufacturer, Ford, is also suspending its operations in Russia indefinitely because of the Ukraine invasion. Ford in a statement said, “Ford is deeply concerned about the invasion of Ukraine and the resultant threats to peace and stability. “This situation has compelled us to reassess our operations in Russia.” Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has left thousands of its citizens displaced.
