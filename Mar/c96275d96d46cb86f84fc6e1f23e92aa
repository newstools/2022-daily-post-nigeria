Manchester United legend, Roy Keane, has warned Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta that the Gunners’ outstanding performance this season will amount to nothing if Tottenham or Manchester United beat them to a top-four finish in the Premier League. Arsenal are currently the favourites to finish fourth behind title rivals Manchester City and Liverpool and third-placed Chelsea. Mikel Arteta’s side sit three points above Tottenham and United and have a game in hand. Arsenal’s next game is a London derby against Patrick Vieira’s Crystal Palace on Monday night. “The next month is going to be vital for Arsenal,” Keane said on Sky Bet’s Overlap show. “The criticism early in the season, they probably didn’t deserve that, but if they finish fifth or sixth, there will still probably be disappointment for Arsenal. “That’s the reality. This is the big test for the team over the next two months. For all the plaudits for the last few months, this is crunch time now. “Come the end of the season, that’s when you really judge teams. If Arsenal finish sixth, I don’t think Arsenal fans will still be saying, ‘it’s a great project, we are all behind it’ “There will be an element of another disappointment if that happens. The next two months are huge.”
