The Chairman of Zamfara State Task Force committee on security, Abubakar Dauran has resigned his political appointment as the Special Adviser to Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle on security matters. The resignation follows the directive of the Governor that any political appointee who wished to contest any elective position in 2023, must resign before 12 midnight of Thursday 17th March 2022. The former chairman of the security task force on security said he resigned because he intends to contest the seat of Shinkafi/ Zurmi federal constituency in the House of Representatives. “I have declared my intention to go into the contest due to the pressure from the people of my constituency who had given me the go-ahead” he added. He said that he has been receiving congratulatory messages from well-wishers, pointing out that he was very optimistic about victory. Recall that when Governor Matawalle assumed office, he appointed Dauran as his Special Adviser on security matters. The Governor also made Dauran the Commissioner of Security and Internal Affairs before he brought him back as his Special Adviser on security matters again. When bandits’ activities in the State became uncontrollable, the Governor constituted a Task Force committee on security and made Dauran the chairman of the Task Force.
