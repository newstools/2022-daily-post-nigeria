Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, has confirmed the arrival of 22 indigenes of the state to Budapest, Hungary. The students were stranded as a result of the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia. The governor gave the confirmation on Monday in a statement through his Spokesman, Muhammad Bello. “Today, not too long ago, I spoke with them via Zoom. From what they told me, there are in good condition. They are in Budapest, Hungary,” Gov. Tambuwal confirmed. He affirmed that the state government is in close contact with the Nigerian authorities at home in Abuja and abroad. “We are in touch with the Federal Government, especially the Nigerian Embassy there and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to see that in the shortest time possible they would return home without any hitch, by the grace of God,” the Governor said.
