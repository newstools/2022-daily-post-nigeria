Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, has warned that it would end in a third World War if President Vladimir Putin of Russia fails to come to the negotiation table. Zelensky said he is ready to meet Putin on the negotiation table but warned that if the attempts fail, it could mean the ongoing war would lead to “a third World War.” “I’m ready for negotiations with him,” the President said, adding that he has been ready for the meeting for the last two years and insisted without negotiations between him and his Russian counterpart, the war will not end. However, Zelensky said that if there is just one percent chance for the conflict to stop, both sides should grab the opportunity, adding more innocent people are being killed on a daily basis. “But, unfortunately, our dignity is not going to preserve our lives. So, I think we have to use any format, any chance in order to have a possibility of negotiating and the possibility of talking to Putin. But if these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third World War,” he told CNN.
