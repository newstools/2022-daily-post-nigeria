Chelsea defender, Antonio Rudiger has reportedly agreed to sign a four-year contract with Juventus this summer. Rudiger’s contract with Chelsea will expire at the end of the season and the Blues cannot offer him an extension because of the UK government’s sanctions placed on the West London club owner, Roman Abramovich. Prior to the sanction, Rudiger had been rumoured to be considering a contract extension at Chelsea, where he has established himself as an exceptional player since joining the Champions League holders from Roma for £31million in 2017. The Germany international has already been linked with moves to the likes of Newcastle, Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid, but he has now reportedly agreed to sign for Juventus. That is according to Italian outlet La Gazzetta dello Sport, who say the 29-year-old has said ‘yes’ to a move to Serie A giants. The report also added that Rudiger ‘will sign a four-year deal’ with Juventus as he prefers them over both Real Madrid and Bayern Munich and he will earn around £5.4m per season. Meanwhile, Juventus have been masters of the free transfer market in the past. The Old Lady signed the likes of Andrea Pirlo, Aaron Ramsey, Dani Alves and Sami Khedira in the past without paying a fee.
