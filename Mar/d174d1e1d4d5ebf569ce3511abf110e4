Nigerian students have described the traumatic situation and humiliation they went through in the hands of Ukrainian officials while trying to escape the country following the Russian invasion of the country. 24-year-old Adetomiwa Adeniyi and 17-year-old Amamchim Steve-Ajufo, both recounted a similar situation to Nigerian Communications Commission, NCC. They were both studying medicine in Ukraine before the war started and they have since returned to Nigeria after fleeing the country. The Nigerian government has been evacuating its citizens in Ukraine, with more than 1,500 already flown back home and Adeniyi and Steve-Ajufo were among those reunited with their families in their home country. They crossed into neighboring Romania through the Ukrainian border before being evacuated and they shared their experience. Adeniyi explained that at the border, the Ukrainian officials created three lines for the Ukrainians and whites, another for the Indians and a separate one for Africans, wondering “why it was like that since we were all trying to get out. “If you were Ukrainian…or white, it was almost as though you had a fast track to the gate (of the border to Romania). I lost the hope that I’ll be able to cross,” he added. Steve-Ajufo said she was ordered back to the queue meant for Africans by Ukrainian border officials when she was seen standing among Ukrainians. “I accidentally went to the Ukrainian line and instantly I was told to return to my side. I cried a whole lot. The border officials kept screaming ‘go back, go back!.’ “I was so tired and cold, and I did not understand what was going on. I wanted to give up several times but I kept reminding myself of my mum,” the 17-year-old medical student said. They eventually made it into the Romanian capital of Bucharest, where they were evacuated back to Nigeria. The Nigerian Government began evacuation of stranded Nigerians from Ukraine on Wednesday, almost a week after the war broke out between Ukraine and Russia.
