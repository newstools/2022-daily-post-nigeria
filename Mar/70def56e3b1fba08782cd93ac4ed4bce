Former Manchester United and Bayern Munich midfielder, Owen Hargreaves, has picked the team that will advance to the Champions League semi-final between Chelsea and Real Madrid. DAILY POST reports that the Champions League quarter-finals draw was conducted on Friday. Chelsea will face Real Madrid, Man City will tackle Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich will clash with Villarreal and Liverpool will battle Benfica. But Hargreaves expects Chelsea to go through to the Champions League last-4 ahead of Real Madrid. “Chelsea will be super confident because they outplayed Real Madrid last year,” Hargreaves told BT Sport. “Real Madrid are underdogs but they have real quality, it’s an incredible group of players. “Chelsea will be wary because of Madrid’s experience. It’s a tough one, but I think Chelsea will go through.”
