Suspected bandits stormed a mosque during evening prayers on Friday, in Giwa Local Government Area of Kaduna State, and kidnapped 14 worshippers. One of the worshippers, Alhaji Buhari Nadama, who said he narrowly escaped, told DAILY POST in Kaduna that they heard gunshots while performing evening prayers (Ishai prayer). He said minutes after, they saw masked men, who were well armed. According to him, the bandits also went away with several cattles from a nearby community, Tudun Amada. Also, a community leader in the area, Alhaji Dauda Mustapha disclosed that while some of the bandits operated in the mosque, others searched several houses, picking women. However, a resident told DAILY POST that four of the kidnapped victims were released on Friday night. The Kaduna Police Command’s Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige did not pick calls, just as he did not respond to text messages sent to him.
