Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand has reacted to claims he could be appointed as the assistant to Manchester United’s potential next permanent manager, Erik ten Hag. According to reports in England, Manchester United’s board has already interviewed Ten Hag for the job, with Ferdinand said to be willing to take up the assistant job. Ten Hag is now the clear frontrunner to take over at Old Trafford and the club could announce him before the end of next month. Ten Hag was expected to bring some of his Ajax coaches with him to Manchester, but reports emerged this week suggesting United’s decision-makers are looking at Rio Ferdinand. The Red Devils were keen to have one of their ex-players on Ten Hag’s coaching staff, with Ferdinand and Robin van Persie two of the names mentioned. But Ferdinand has rubbished the reports, particularly suggestions that he put himself forward for the role. Quoting the rumour, Ferdinand replied on Twitter: “Who’s feeding you this sh*t?! Put myself forward yanoooooo.” The link with Ten Hag’s fellow Dutchman, Van Persie might make a little more sense, given that the 38-year-old has actually been coaching at Feyenoord and working with both the senior team and the Under-16 side.
