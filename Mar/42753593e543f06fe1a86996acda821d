Bandits on Wednesday abducted two farmers; Wada and Idi, at Unguwar Barde village along the Kaduna-Abuja highway. A source disclosed that the farmers were busy clearing their farmland in preparation for this year’s farming season when the bandits picked them. Confirming the incident on Thursday, a resident in the area, who is also a farmer, Mr. Joseph Auta said the two farmers went to clear the farm, awaiting this year’s farming season. He said the kidnappers called that the two farmers are with them and that the family should prepare to pay a ransom. “Most of us are farmers. We are living and feeding on our farm produce. We don’t harvest much as the ground soil is fading out. Most of us here, don’t have our three square meals a day because we don’t have enough. ” Kidnappers cannot get what they need from us because we are all peasant farmers. I wonder how they think about the people in this community,” he said tearfully. According to him, the whole villagers are confused and terrified even though the bandits are yet to make a ransom demand. The Kaduna State Police Command Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige, did not pick his calls to confirm or refute the report.
