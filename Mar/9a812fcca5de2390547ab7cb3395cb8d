Armed military personnel and members of the Rapid Response Squad, RRS, of the Lagos State Police Command on Tuesday morning stormed the Gani Fawehinmi Park in Ojota, Lagos, as youths plan to protest the death of Oluwabamise Ayanwola. Some youths Monday planned to stage a protest at the park on Tuesday, demanding justice for Oluwabamise Ayanwola, a 22-year-old fashion designer who was murdered after boarding a Bus Rapid Transit, BRT, on Lagos Island. In an earlier flier on social media, the youths threatened to storm the state Secretariat in Alausa, Ikeja, and all BRT terminals in the state to demand justice and the prosecution of all suspects. Apparently, to maintain law and order and safety of lives and property, there was a heavy presence of security personnel, including Police, Army, and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC, around Ojota Bus Stop and environs at strategic points. Also, scores of patrol vans, heavy anti-riot gun trucks and Black Marias were seen at the protests venues. Meanwhile, the protest scheduled is yet to hold at the proposed venues: Fawenhimi Park and Alausa Secretariat, Ikeja.
