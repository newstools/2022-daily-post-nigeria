Former Russian President, Dmitry Medvedev, has said that there are several grounds under which his country has the right to use nuclear weapons. He said some of these grounds include an “attack on the country or encroachment on infrastructure as a result of which Russia’s nuclear deterrent forces would be paralyzed.” The Russian ex-president who is the deputy head of security council said this on Friday while speaking with state-owned RIA news agency, according to Al Jazeera. Russia has vowed to continue its assault on Ukraine until it accomplishes its goals of “demilitarization and denazification” of Ukraine and there are growing fears that the US and its NATO allies may interfere along the line even though they have said on several occasions that there were no such plans. Russia is “determined to defend the independence, sovereignty of our country, not to give anyone a reason to doubt even the slightest that we are ready to give a worthy response to any infringement on our country, on its independence,” the ex-President warned.
