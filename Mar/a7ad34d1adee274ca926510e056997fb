The family of the late Lagos BRT passenger, Bamise Ayanwola, have rejected the autopsy date. The brother, Pelumi Abegunde spoke to reporters on Friday in Ikeja, Lagos State. He said the police gave them a short notice as they received an invitation on Wednesday for the autopsy scheduled for Thursday. “We rejected it because we felt such time was not enough for us to witness it. We deserve to invite our own pathologist because we want fairness.” Abegunde disclosed that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu spoke with Bamise’s father on phone. He noted that the visit of Sanwo-Olu to the family house would have calmed nerves. “I trust him but he will not be the one to conduct the autopsy, his people will give him the report, he trusted them but we don’t.” Abegunde further said without autopsy, the evidence was clear regarding what led to the untimely death of Bamise.
