Manchester United legend, Gary Neville, has urged the club to appoint Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone as their next permanent manager. Neville believes Man United needs a tough manager like Simeone, adding that the 51-year-old should be among candidates to become the club’s next manager. Recall that Man United had appointed current manager, Ralf Rangnick, on an interim basis. Rangnick is expected to leave Man United at the end of the season. “Diego Simeone should be a candidate, but it is never been achievable to get him out of Atletico Madrid. He is wedded in there, he is tied,” Neville said, as reported by the Manchester Evening News. “But it would be brilliant to see him in the Premier League, you saw [against Manchester United], I have seen it many times – I got beaten 2-0 in Valencia by his brilliant Atletico Madrid team that [Antoine] Griezmann was in before he went to Barcelona. “He is a fantastic coach, brutal in how he approaches the game, I think in every single way. He’s tough, and Manchester United needs a tough manager.”
