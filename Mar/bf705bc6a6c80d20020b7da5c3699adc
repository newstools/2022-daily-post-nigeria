Simon Ekpa, a self-acclaimed disciple of the leader of Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, has commended the Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom for speaking out in the face of insecurity ravaging the state and other parts of the country. Ortom had called out the Federal Government for allegedly ignoring the killing of citizens by suspected Fulani herdsmen who have also displaced over 1.5 million people in the state. In a tweet on his official Twitter handle on Wednesday, Ekpa, who is a dual citizen of both Nigeria and Finland, advised the governor to arm the Benue youths to fight the bandits. According to him, such a move would lead to elimination of the assailants from the state. The tweet reads, “We commend Governor Ortom of Benue State for always speaking out against the genocide FG are committing in his State through Fulani Jihadists herdsmen. “We are calling on Ortom to be serious this time, arm every youth in Benue and let us fight these terrorists and chase them away.”
