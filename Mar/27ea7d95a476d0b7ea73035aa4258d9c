Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola, has insisted that he would prefer to lose against Manchester United this weekend and win the Premier League title at the end of the season. Guardiola’s men will host Man United in a Premier League derby on Sunday at Etihad Stadium. The Citizens are presently on top of the Premier League table ahead of second position Liverpool. In the reverse fixture at Old Trafford last year, Man City triumphed 2-0 against Man United, thanks to first-half goals from Eric Bailly (own goal) and Bernardo Silva. Speaking during his pre-match press conference on Friday, the former Bayern Munich and Barcelona manager acknowledged the importance of the derby but insisted it will always be secondary to him. “I know how important the derby is for our fans, but we don’t play to win the derby, we play to win the Premier League. Winning the derby helps us win the Premier League. “We know what we have to do. Lose on Sunday and win the Premier League, I will sign right now,” Guardiola said.
