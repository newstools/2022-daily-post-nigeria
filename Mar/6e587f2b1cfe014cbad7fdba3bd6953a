The gubernatorial candidate of the Wale Ojo faction of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the recently conducted primary election in Osun State, Dotun Babayemi has cautioned the Iyorchia Ayu-led National Working Committee of the party to be mindful of the way it handles affairs in the party. In a widely circulated statement made available to journalists in Osogbo on Wednesday, Babayemi, who assured that the State would be convincingly won with his candidacy due to his antecedents, added that the support he has been receiving across the State was an evidence. The PDP factional guber candidate also noted that his candidature had become an imperative if the party is desirous of winning the coveted gubernatorial election in the July polls. He averred that the people of the State were already tired of the administration of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and they were desperately yearning for a change through him. According to him, “The onus is now on us to put our house in order and this is where the support of everybody, especially the national leadership of our party is germane. Enough of bickering, hide-and-seek and related shenanigans. “So, if our great party under the leadership of Senator Iyorchia Ayu is truly desirous of clinching the gubernatorial position at the coming State election, then everything must be done rightly to rally around my emergence as the party’s candidate endorsed by stakeholders and members across the State. “As someone on a rescue mission, my eventual victory at the coming polls would go a long way in rejuvenating the psyche of the people of the State that have been bruised due to bad governance.”
