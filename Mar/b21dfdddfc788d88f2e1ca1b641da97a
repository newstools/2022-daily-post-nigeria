Polish President, Andrzej Duda has urged the United States and other world power to join hands and rescue Ukraine from Russian invasion. The President further described as an act of “barbarity and genocide” a recent attack on a maternity and children’s hospital by Russia. Duda spoke in Warsaw on Thursday after a meeting with US Vice President, Kamala Harris. “We need to take a tough stance as representatives of the free world,” he said, adding that “we have to rescue Ukraine,” and calling for an “all hands onboard” approach, according to CNN. “Ukraine needs to be helped, and we have to stay united in that respect,” he said. Over 1.5 million Ukrainian refugees are already in Poland, according to Duda, who added that he was “proud” of how ordinary Polish families have received them in their “private homes.” He said that none of the Ukrainian refugees are being housed in camps but private houses.
