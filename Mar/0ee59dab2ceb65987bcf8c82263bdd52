The former Minister of State for Health, Fidelis Nwankwo has declared to run for governorship under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Ebonyi State. Nwankwo, a former council chairman of Izzi LGA while speaking to stakeholders and founding fathers of the state during his official declaration in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, vowed to restore peace and revive the education sector which he claimed was in a state of collapse. The former Minister, however, urged the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in the state to zone the governorship position to Ebonyi North senatorial district for the sake of equity and fairness. Nwankwo said, “it is, therefore, my firm belief that we need to prioritize and invest in education in Ebonyi State to kick-start real development that will involve and impact the people. “Educational development has for long remained my passion and for me, the panacea for sustained development.
