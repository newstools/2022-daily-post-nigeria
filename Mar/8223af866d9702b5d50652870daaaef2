Admitted victims of the Kaduna – Abuja ill-fated train may require more blood transfusion, having lost so much blood following the grievous injuries incurred during the attack. Sources at the 44 Army Reference Hospital in Kaduna where the victims are being treated said many of them have blood shortages. A victim’s relative said many were bleeding as they were being evacuated, adding that his relative who was also losing blood was immediately attended to by the medical doctors who were on ground before their arrival. He said, “I think, some of them will need the help of blood donors because even if there is blood in the blood bank, it may not be enough for those victims that need blood. However, the National Blood Transfusion Services, Kaduna has said the commission was ready to offer blood services. The Public Relation Officer, National Blood Transfusion Service(NBS), Kaduna, Haruna Abdullah, told DAILY POST that its service is available 24 hours. “The NBTS Kaduna is fully on the ground to attend to incidences of blood shortage in Kaduna. Despite the unsteady power supply, the commission has maintained a steady cold chain to maintain and preserve the blood that we have on ground.”
