Former Manchester United striker, Louis Saha, has asked the club to hire Zinedine Zidane as their next permanent manager. Zidane has been out of work since he left Real Madrid for the second time. Saha has urged United to snap up his compatriot before another club or national team swoops in. He told Mirror Football: “It’s really difficult throwing names about. “My pick is Zinedine Zidane before he gets signed by another club or a national team! But it’s difficult because you need someone who has the clear vision and is able to get going straight away. “I know Rangnick has had a few issues, maybe because of his position not being fully solid. So it’s really hard to manage at the moment. “It’s such a tough, tough position and job that anyone can make mistakes in.”
