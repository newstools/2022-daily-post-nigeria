A Rivers State High Court in Port Harcourt will on Thursday, March 24, deliver judgment on a matter brought by one Ogechi Ogwu-Edwin and three other members of the All Progressives Congress against the former state Caretaker Committee Chairman of the party, Isaac Ogbobula. The court is also expected to deliver judgment in a suit by one Alabibo Soibibo and three others against the APC and Ogbobula. The two sets of plaintiffs are seeking for an interlocutory injuction against the APC and its former Caretaker Committee Chairman over the conduct of congresses in Rivers State. The claimants are praying the court to stop APC from going ahead to do anything concerning the Congress because they allegedly refused to allow them access to nomination forms after making payments. The Presiding Judge, Justice C.N Wali adjourned till Thursday for judgment after counsels representing the parties argued and adopted their final written addresses. The judgment of the court will determine if members of Chief Emeka Beke-led excos will make the list of delegates to participate in the Saturday APC convention in Abuja or if the party will conduct fresh congresses in the state. DAILY POST had reported how the former judge handling the matter, Justice I.R Minakiri, had in February recused herself from the matter following a petition against her. The Chief Judge of Rivers State, Justice Simeon Amadi, thereafter reassigned the case to another judge.
