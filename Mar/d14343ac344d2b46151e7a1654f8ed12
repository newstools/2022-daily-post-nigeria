Some leaders and members of the All Progressives Congress (APC), under the aegis of North Central APC Forum, have insisted on the emergence of the next president from the zone. The group also said the North Central will not compromise the 2023 presidency for any other position because it is time for the president to come from the region for the sake of “equity and fairness”. Saleh Mandung Zazzaga spoke on behalf of the group in Jos, the Plateau State while addressing newsmen on Wednesday. He said, “We are much engaged in initiating political activities that would benefit the region, and that they will not back down on their decision for the emergence of the next president from the region. “As loyal APC leaders/members, we have been working for the success of the party in one way or the order, and whatever we do, we always have the success of the party at heart.” He explained that forming a forum to project the North Central region is legitimate, pointing out that even among the governors, legislators and local government chairmen, there are forums representing diverse regions of the country. “And so for us, our aim is for the 2023 presidency to be zoned to the North Central. This is because apart from the military era, since the democratic dispensation, the region hasn’t actually produced either the president or the vice president, but has largely contributed to the democratic growth of the nation. It would be fair and equitable, therefore, for the presidency to be zoned to the region,” he said. Zazzaga called on the APC national leaders to carefully consider their quest, adding that the 2023 presidency is very critical and so the APC should not make any mistake in its choice of the party flag bearer as the leading opposition, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is waiting for any ‘wrong’ move from the APC to capitalize on it and spring up a surprise.
