Seventy-five (75) persons have been abducted by armed men suspected to be bandits in Kekun Waje District of Bungudu local government area of Zamfara State. A source told DAILY POST that more than 60 persons were abducted from the same community over a month ago in a similar attack by suspected bandits. He explained that the 60 persons abducted last month are still in captivity. He further explained that there is an increase in bandits’ attacks on the community since the local vigilantes stopped them (bandits) from holding away. According to him, “The vigilantes defended the community. The criminals warned that unless the vigilantes disarm, they won’t release the kidnapped victims. With the abduction of 15 more people, there are 75 people, including women and children, with them.” The source explained that the community learned a lesson from the experience of some of the neighbouring communities that entered into negotiations with armed criminals, explaining that, notwithstanding, the armed men are still attacking them and humiliating their women. He stated that the criminals are dubious, stressing that no matter what agreement reached with them, they would continue to assault your communities, which is why they took the firm decision of defending their community despite the threats of attack. SP Muhammad Shehu, the spokesman of the state police command, could not be reached for comment at the time of filing this report.
