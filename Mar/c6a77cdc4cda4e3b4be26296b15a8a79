Super Eagles star, Akinkunmi Amoo, has broken his silence following Nigeria’s failure to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar this year. Nigeria failed to qualify for Qatar 2022 after playing a 1-1 draw with the Black Stars of Ghana at the MKO Abiola Stadium in Abuja on Tuesday evening. Amoo was not included in the matchday squad for the 0-0 draw in the first leg in Kumasi last Friday. The FC Copenhagen star was also an unused substitute in the second leg in Abuja as goals from Thomas Partey and William Troost-Ekong ensured both teams drew as Ghana qualified for the World Cup by away goal. Reacting to the development, Amoo, in a tweet via his Twitter handle on Thursday, said life is all about learning while apologizing to Nigerians for Super Eagles’ failure to qualify for the World Cup. “Tears and pains, it wasn’t the result we wanted. We apologize for not making it to Qatar. I’m honoured for the opportunity, my joy would have been accomplished with a World Cup ticket,” Amoo wrote on Twitter. “Life is about learning, we will bounce back from this setback. We appreciate your support.”
