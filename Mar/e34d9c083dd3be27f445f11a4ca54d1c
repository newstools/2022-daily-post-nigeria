Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, on Saturday, accused the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, of accepting defeat ahead of 2023 election. Keyamo said the PDP was desperately looking for a back-door route to power. He was reacting to a suit by the PDP asking an Abuja Federal High Court to invalidate the All Progressives Congress, APC, national convention. The minister advised the opposition party to be prepared to explain to Nigerians why APC has outscored them with the limited resources at its disposal. In a tweet, Keyamo wrote: “Sign of a Party already accepting defeat at the polls and desperately looking for a back-door route to power. “PDP should get ready to meet Nigerians at the polls and explain why the APC’s 7 years (with lesser resources) have outscored PDP’s 16 years in infrastructural development.” The former ruling party had filed the suit seeking to invalidate the outcome of APC’s national convention. In the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CR/389/2022, the opposition party urged the court to stop the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from recognising or having any business whatsoever with the APC as a registered political party.
