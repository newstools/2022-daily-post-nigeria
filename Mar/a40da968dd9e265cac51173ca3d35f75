The Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Ndudi Elumelu has raised concerns about the ongoing investigation into the gruesome murder of Bamise Ayanmola. Elumelu, in his motion on Wednesday, raised concerns on the change of story by the arrested BRT driver, Andrew Nice. It would be recalled that Mr Nice was arrested by the Department of State Security in connection with the abduction and killing of the late Ayanmola. The late Ayanmola was declared missing by family members and later found dead with several parts missing. After his arrest, Mr Nice had confessed to raping the late Ayanmola. However, in a subsequent video, the driver claimed he was coerced into driving the bus by the assailants who threatened him with a gun. In his motion, Elumelu said the driver’s recant of his story calls for concerns. “There are allegations that the BRT driver earlier confessed of having canal knowledge of late miss Bamise before killing her and harvesting some vital organs only for the story to change after some influential Nigerians intervened on his behalf,” he said. Following the adoption of the motion, the House resolved that the Nigeria Police Force and the National Security Intelligence must fast track the investigations and ensure that the killers of Miss Oluwabamise Ayanwola are brought to justice. A minute silence was also observed in honour of the deceased
