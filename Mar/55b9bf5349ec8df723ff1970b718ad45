Super Eagles forward, Chidera Ejuke, could leave his Russian club CSKA Moscow on a temporary basis. This comes amid reports that FIFA want to invoke an emergency rule that would allow foreign players in Russia to break their contracts immediately. New York Times reports that FIFPRO, the body that represents professional footballers, have sent a request to FIFA requesting to allow the foreign players in Russia to terminate their contracts. According to the organisation, some of the players have expressed concerns over playing in Russia at the moment, due to the crisis going on between the country and Ukraine. And it was revealed that FIFA could invoke an emergency rule by Monday. Ejuke could take advantage of this new rule to leave CSKA until the end of the season. The Nigerian international joined the Russian club in 2020 from Heerenveen and has a contract until 2024.
