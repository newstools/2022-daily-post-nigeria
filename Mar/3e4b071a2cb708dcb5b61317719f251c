The chairman of Zamfara State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Hon Tukur Umar Danfulani has admonished the leaders of the State’s branch of MIyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) to give sound education to the Fulani youths. Addressing the leaders of MACBAN in Gusau, the State capital, the State chairman of APC requested the Fulani leaders in the State to map out workable ways of sensitizing their youths to enable them live good lives. The chairman gave the charge when he received members of the Association, led by Alhaji Ahmad Hussaini Matawallen Tudun-Wada, who paid him courtesy visit at the State secretariat of the party. Danfulani, who lamented that due to ignorance or by deliberate connotation, the Fulani community had been degraded, as everybody continue to brand them as bandits. He explained that there is no tribe that has no criminals among its communities, saying that the MACBAN leaders have the responsibility to sensitize their members to continue to display the good traits they are known for. He called on those who engage in banditry activities to denounce their criminal ways and return to their legitimate endevours. “When this is done, those who see the Fulani people in bad light will see the truth, while the Fulani youths will want to go to school, get educated and contribute meaningfully to societal growth,” he added. He commended the Fulani leaders for the visit and assured that the All Progressive Congress (APC) will continue to carry them along in all its activities. Earlier, the leader of the MACBAN in the State, Alhaji Ahmad Hussaini Matawallen Tudun-Wada said they were at the party secretarial to express their loyalty to the Bello Matawalle-led administration.
