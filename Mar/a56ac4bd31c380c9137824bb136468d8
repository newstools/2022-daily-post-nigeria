Following the release of zoning of National leadership offices of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), a group operating under the aegis of Indigenous People of Nigeria (IPN), on Thursday, faulted the zonal arrangement of the national leadership offices of the party. Speaking at a press conference in Abuja, Convener of the group, Mazi Nnamdi Iroegbu, said the arrangement was a manifest insensitivity to the multi-ethnic setting of the country, insisting that it portend danger to the corporate existence of the country. The group observed that the zoning arrangement by the All Progressives Congress was “unjust to a section of the country, specifically, the Southeast”, insisting that the party was toying with the unity of the country. The APC, DAILY POST earlier reported, had zoned the National Chairman to the North Central, when the Deputy Chairman (North) to the Northwest and Chairman (South) to the South East as well as National Secretary to the South West. The group argued that South West had held the chairmanship position of the APC, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Vice President of the country, hence, the current arrangement has shown that South East wasn’t considered important to the party. The group asserted: “We hold the view as earlier expressed by APC that the North and South swerved positions, such that all positions initially held by the North automatically go to the South and vice versa. “Needless to say that this is an unjust treatment so provocative and vindictive that immediate redress is required. “Failure on the part of APC to correct the wrong treatment amounts to deepening the South East alienation and further threatening the corporate existence of Nigeria. IPN lamented that the country under the APC has been in terrible disarray, wondering how the party continues to get it wrong to take steps to unite the nation.
