Popular sociopolitical activist, Aisha Yesufu, has categorically told Nigerians that President Muhammadu Buhari is the reason the military have not been able to defeat the terrorists killing Nigerians across the country. Within the last 72 hours, there have been several attacks, kidnappings and killing of innocent citizens in Kaduna and other states in the Northwest. DAILY POST recalls that gunmen bombed the Abuja-Kaduna train between Katari and Rigina axis on Monday night leaving hundreds of passengers dead in the attack. Many passengers were said to have been initially kidnapped including Zamfara state former deputy Governor, Mallam Ibrahim Wakkala Liman, during the deadly attack. The terrorists shot many passengers dead as unascertained number of the passengers also sustained various degrees of injury as a result of gun shots. Just yesterday night, armed men stormed Kofar Gayan low-cost, Zaria, Kaduna, Kidnapped a customs officer, Muawiyya Gambo Turaki and nine others. Speaking to DAILY POST in Kaduna on Thursday, a resident of the community, Alhaji Shehu Usman, said of a sudden, he heard sporadic shooting and had to lie down in the mosque where he went to pray. According to him, the bandits who came around 9.00pm, were shooting indiscriminately to scare people away.
This is the second time bandits would invade Kofar Gayan low-cost and abduct people. There are also reports of terrorists attack on Wednesday at the Kubwa axis of Abuja. Aisha Yesufu believes that the “military can defeat the terrorists terrorising our people,” she tweeted. “What is missing is political will and leadership. The Commander-in-chief of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is the problem. Buhari is the problem.”
