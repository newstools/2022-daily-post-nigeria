Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, is on the run from sanctions and may have fled to Moscow after the European Union (EU) decided to punish him, according to the Daily Mail. The 55-year-old Russian billionaire looked grey and thin as he flew to Tel Aviv in his private jet yesterday. This trip came after Israel made it clear it will not be a safe place for sanctioned oligarchs. Abramovich was pictured in the VIP lounge of Ben Gurion Airport, shortly before the aircraft took off for Turkey. Last night the same plane flew into Russia, landing in Moscow at around 3am UK time. The flights put Abramovich’s £49m Gulfstream beyond the reach of Israel and the EU. On Monday night, a BBC Panorama documentary accused Abramovich of being “Putin’s money man” and said it had uncovered new evidence about alleged corrupt deals that made his gigantic fortune. Last week, the UK government imposed sanctions on him, which will have big implications for Chelsea. The Premier League side are unable to sell any tickets or merchandise and cannot offer new contracts to players. Only supporters who are season ticket holders will be able to attend matches at Stamford Bridge.
