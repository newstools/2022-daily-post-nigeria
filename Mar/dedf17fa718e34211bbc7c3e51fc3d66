As part of preparations for 2022 Hajj, the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON), has directed State Muslims Pilgrims’ Welfare Boards/Agencies and Commissions (SPWBs) to migrate Hajj fare deposits made by intending pilgrims into the Hajj Savings Scheme (HSS) platform with Jaiz Bank. The HSS platform was approved as the unified registration option due to its profitability and transparent design in line with the Commission’s first come first served eligibility criterion. This option was well thought out as a parameter for justice to those who have made deposits earlier. “Please note that status quo with regards to pilgrims’ welfare arrangement remains the same under the states unless restructured by the host country,” a statement signed by Fatima Sanda Usara, Head, Public Affairs of NAHCON, said. NAHCON called upon SPWB/A/Cs to fast-track the migration of pilgrims’ funds into the scheme to enable prudent preparations for the Hajj season to begin considering the time factor. The Commission said that its leadership acknowledges the quickness with which a couple of states have responded to the directive describing it as a vital contribution for a smooth Hajj operation. “Efforts being made by many more SPWBs Executives Secretaries towards migrating their pilgrims’ Hajj fares into the approved channel is also recogniSed. Others yet to commence are advised to do so immediately to avoid last minute omissions resulting from hastiness,” it added. NAHCON assured of its untiring support to all state welfare boards having technical problems while moving the said funds, adding that such SPWBs are advised to contact the nearest Jaiz Bank branch for assistance. Meanwhile, the Commission said it is awaiting Saudi Arabia’s final decision on Nigeria’s quota allocation to facilitate local distribution of slots.
