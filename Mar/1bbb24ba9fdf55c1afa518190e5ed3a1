The Plateau State chapter of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has set up a seven-member reconciliatory committee to help reconcile aggrieved members ahead of the 2023 general elections. The party has also set up a seven-member disciplinary committee to help address issues of indiscipline that may arise in the party within the said period. Chairman of PDP in the state, Hon. Chris Hassan, while inaugurating the two committees at the State Secretariat of the party in Jos, said “to whom much is given, much is expected”. Hassan said, “The reconciliatory committee is to reconcile those who want to be reconciled; because there are people who do not want reconciliation because the ruling party are giving them money. “So, for them, if reconciliation is achieved, that conduit pipe from the government of the day will cease.” On the disciplinary committee, the chairman said, “For the disciplinary committee, it will take care of all disciplinary cases that will arise in the party. “So you are supposed to be the eye of the party.” Hassan further explained that “These committees are very important to Exco. And that is why if you see their composition, we took the time to choose them. “We went to their various chairmen and elders of their communities; and some of them that we served to together, its base on their track record of achievement when they were in government, and for that reason, to whom much is given, much is expected.” Responding, the chairman of the reconciliatory committee, Hon. Benedict Shignuhul assured that his committee will “judiciously and religiously do its job.” Also, the chairman of the disciplinary committee, Barr Monday Agwom, said, “I can assure all party members of fairness and equity.” Agwom however warned that “we will not respect anybody who will not respect himself”.
