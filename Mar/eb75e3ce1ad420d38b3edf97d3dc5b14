One Miss Okike Chinyere, a female inmate of the Nigerian Correctional Service, Lagos State Command, has bagged a second-class upper degree from the Department of Peace and Conflict Resolution, National Open University, NOUN. According to a statement by the correctional service, the inmate emerged best graduating student of the department. Similarly, another inmate, Alegbe Afolabi was also awarded a Masters of Science in Peace and Conflict Resolution from the same institution. Nweke Chibueze, another graduating inmate who spoke on behalf of others, appreciated the Controller General, Haliru Nababa, and the Vice-Chancellor of NOUN for giving them the opportunity to further their education. He, however, pleaded for clemency for the graduating students to allow them give their quota to the development of the country. While speaking during the presentation of the Bachelor of Science certificate to eight graduands from the Lagos Command, the state Controller of Correctional Service, Adewale Francis Adebisi, urged the inmates to imbibe the virtues of education. He urged them to use the opportunity available while in detention to better their lives so that when they finally regain freedom, they can contribute positively to the society.
