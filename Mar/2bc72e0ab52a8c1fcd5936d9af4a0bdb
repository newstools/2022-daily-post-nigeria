The United Kingdom government has said it would deploy its Sky Sabre air defence system to Poland. Britain said it would also deploy along with it, 100 troops to operate it. The UK Ministry of Defence said this after the Polish government had requested the anti-air warfare system. The UK defence ministry disclosed this on Twitter. “Sky Sabre has unprecedented speed, accuracy, performance and target acquisition, which will significantly enhance Poland’s air defences,” it said on Twitter. According to British Defence Secretary, Ben Wallace, the deployment will help Poland “stand tall against Russian threats” as it carries “much of the burden of this war.” He said the deployment will help the Polish government protect its airspace from “any further aggression from Russia,” he added. Due to its involvement and support for Ukraine, there are growing fears that Russia may also attack Poland in a matter of time.
