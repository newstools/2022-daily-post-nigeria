FIFA have confirmed that Russia have been kicked out from the 2022 World Cup qualifying series. The decision comes in the wake of President Vladimir Putin’s decision to launch military strikes in Ukraine. Russia’s opponents, Poland, have been given a bye into the Path B playoff final on March 29. Poland had been due to face Russia in the semi-final of the playoff process days earlier. But the Polish FA and players insisted they did not want to play against Russia. Poland will now face either Sweden or the Czech Republic in the final. A statement from FIFA read: “Subsequent to the decision of 28 February 2022 taken jointly with the UEFA Executive Committee to suspend all Russian teams from participation in both FIFA and UEFA competitions until further notice, the Bureau of the FIFA Organising Committee decided that Poland will receive a bye to the final of Path B due to take place on 29 March 2022, in which they will face the winners of the match between Sweden and the Czech Republic.”
