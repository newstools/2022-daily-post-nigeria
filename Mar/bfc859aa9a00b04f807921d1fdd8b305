Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola appears to have taken a dig at Cristiano Ronaldo after his team defeated Manchester United 4-1 at the Etihad on Sunday. The Spaniard seems to have been impressed with United’s aggression in the first half of the clash without Ronaldo in the squad. The former Barcelona coach said it is something Manchester United can do without Cristiano Ronaldo in the lineup. Manchester United were demolished 4-1 with two goals each from Kevin de Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez in each of the halves. United managed to pull one back through Jadon Sancho during the first half when United competed well with City and went in at the break 2-1 down. Ronaldo was said to have sustained a hip problem on Friday and was not available for selection and Guardiola believes this could have been a blessing in disguise in terms of being able to press and show aggression. “They make a 4-2-4, so aggressive for the mentality of Ralf. Without Cristiano they can do it,” Guardiola told the press after the match. “They were incredibly aggressive and we struggled to deal with that. “I’d say in the first half we had more chances with the counter-attack than with possession,” he said.
