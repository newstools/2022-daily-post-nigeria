The BUA cement factory in Sokoto State was destroyed by fire outbreak on Saturday. The incident resulted to the death of three persons, while many were said to have sustained various degrees of injuries. According to eyewitnesses, the inferno, which started on Friday morning, destroyed many equipment and other valuables belonging to the company. An eyewitness, one Usman Abubakar said a combined team of the Federal and the State fire service officers were still battling to quench the fire. “The incident was so serious that the scene has been crowded with sympartizers who were trying to rescue the company from further damages,” he said. Investigation carried out by DAILY POST revealed that the inferno was suspected to have been caused by an uploading fuel tanker. Another source said that a worker was repairing a stationed tank when it exploded. The source said three persons died and three others sustained injuries as result of the incident, which overpowered the company’s safety officers. When contacted, the Fire Prevention Officer of the Sokoto State Fire Service, Nuhu Lawal, confirmed the incident. But one Umar Nura-Sifawa, an official of the Federal Fire Service in Sokoto, who was also at the scene, said the incident was as a result of an ‘oil fire’, which takes longer period to extinguish.
