Former England defender, Micah Richards, has tipped Manchester City and Liverpool to win every trophy that is up for grabs this season. Richards hailed the two teams as the best the Premier League has seen. City are currently six points ahead of the Reds, who have one outstanding game to play. Jurgen Klopp’s men have also won the Carabao Cup. Both clubs are also in the running to lift the FA Cup and Champions League titles. “I am in no doubt we are witnessing the top two teams the Premier League has seen. “There are three trophies up for grabs from here — I believe City and Liverpool will win them all,” Richards wrote in his Daily Mail column.
