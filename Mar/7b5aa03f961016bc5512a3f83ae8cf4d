At least three countries can still qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. As of today, 29 out of the 32 teams that will play in the tournament have been confirmed. Three places remain unconfirmed and they will be taken by the two winners of the intercontinental play-offs and the winner of the last UEFA play-off. In the intercontinental play-offs one of Costa Rica or New Zealand will advance to the finals. Peru will take on Australia or United Arab Emirates (UAE) for a spot at the World Cup. From the UEFA path, Wales will play Scotland or Ukraine for the chance to qualify. This means three of Costa Rica, New Zealand, Peru, Australia, UAE, Wales, Scotland and Ukraine could be in Qatar. The final qualifiers for World Cup 2022 will be known in June, with exact dates still to be confirmed. The intercontinental play-offs will be contested on June 13 and 14, 2022. However, there is some uncertainty around the dates for the final UEFA play-off, with Scotland’s semi-final against Ukraine on hold due to the military conflict in the eastern European country.
