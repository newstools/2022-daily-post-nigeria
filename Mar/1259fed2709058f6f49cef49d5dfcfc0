President Muhammadu Buhari has hailed the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) on the occasion of its 70th anniversary. The 70th annual council meeting will be hosted in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, from March 14 to 18. In a statement on Sunday by spokesman Femi Adesina, Buhari highlighted he was a founding member of the foremost examining board. He affirmed that Nigeria values the shared commitment with other members of WAEC and would continue to engage with partners. Buhari promised to assist the council to achieve its mandate of maintaining quality educational standards to meet the challenges of the 21st century. WAEC has brought the English-speaking West Africans together to encourage academic and moral excellence through a qualitative educational assessment, he noted. Ahead of this week’s meeting, the Buhari urged the council to remember the core values of excellence, integrity, professionalism, accountability and transparency. The President believes that just as member-nations have survived the COVID-19 pandemic and internal conflict, “this cherished education institution would continue to thrive as a world-class examination body”.
