The people of Shomo and Jole communities in Lau Local Government Council of Taraba State, have unanimously agreed to put their differences aside by embracing peace. This, they demonstrated on Wednesday in Jalingo, the state capital, when both communities came together to sign a peace accord, vowing to desist from acts capable of igniting crisis in the communities and the council at large. Representatives from the two communities, which included traditional rulers, religious leaders, youth representatives and other stakeholders, collectively agreed to work as a team to herald the much needed peace to the communities. The signing of the peace accord, which was presided over by the deputy governor, Engineer Haruna Manu, was observed to have been witnessed by security chiefs, as well as top government functionaries. The two communities, it would be recalled, have been at loggerheads over fish pond, a situation which has not only led to massive destruction of lives and property, but also brought to standstill business activities. Elated by the decisions of both communities, the deputy governor, said the accord, has finally laid to rest the skirmishes which have in the past made the people take up arms against themselves. Believing that peace has finally come to stay in the communities, he beckoned on the two warring communities, to stay away from things that would ignite outbreak of crisis, stating that “We all need your commitments and we hope that we have come to the end of the crisis with the signing of the peace accord.”
