A former Special Adviser on Communication to Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, Modele Sarafa-Yusuf, took many by surprise on Wednesday when she declared to join the state gubernatorial race against her former principal. The woman, who headed the media team during Gov Abiodun’s campaign in 2019, will be contesting the ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC) with the incumbent ahead of the 2023 elections. It was not clear when Sarafa-Yusuf resigned from Abiodun’s government, but there are speculations that the ace sports broadcaster had fallen out with the governor over an undisclosed issue. DAILY POST reports that Abiodun had told his appointees who have political ambition to inform the government before the closes of work on Wednesday. Many were taken aback when the female journalist assembled women at the Osoba Adire Kampala International Market, Asero, Abeokuta, to declare her ambition. Asked to explain why she had decided to contest against her former principal, Sarafa-Yusuf maintained that she joined the race since Abiodun had not declared his intention to run for a second term. “The governor has not told me he is running, if people can go around and say things, and declare on behalf of a politician, it’s up to the politician to say, I want to run. He has not said so as far as I know.”
