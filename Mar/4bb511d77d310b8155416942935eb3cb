The Federal High Court in Ikoyi, Lagos, has sent a citizen Michael Jackson to prison for internet fraud. Jackson was arrested in January and prosecuted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The anti-graft agency said he posed as Ella Ellywood, a transgender woman, to scam victims of millions of Naira. Jackson, Disc Jockey (DJ), was in possession of fetish items “for grace and success” at the time of arrest. Justice Tijani Ringim sentenced him to three months imprisonment after he pleaded guilty to one-count charge of impersonation. The offence violated Section 22(2)(b) Of the Cybercrime (Prohibition, Prevention, ETC) Act 2015.
