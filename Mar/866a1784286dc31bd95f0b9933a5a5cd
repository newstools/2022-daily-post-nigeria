The Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, has revealed that President Muhammadu Buhari told governors elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), that he would prefer Abdullahi Adamu to emerge as the party’s national chairman. Following a meeting with the President on Wednesday, the chairman of the Progressive Governors’ Forum (PGF), Atiku Bagudu, made it clear that the APC governors would support Buhari’s preferred chairmanship candidate. Speaking on Channels TV’s Politics Today on Thursday, Lalong claimed Buhari wants the party’s national chairmanship slot to be zoned to the north-central. He said: “The president said he preferred the chairman should come from the north-central zone. “Then we went back again after deliberations and we asked ‘do you have a preferred candidate in the north-central zone?’ He said, ‘yes, I will prefer if Abdullahi has met the choice’.” Lalong, however, added that party delegates who feel otherwise, can vote for their choice at the forthcoming convention. Adamu was Nasarawa State Governor from 1999 to 2007 and is currently the Senator representing Nasarawa west. He also chairs the APC national reconciliation committee.
