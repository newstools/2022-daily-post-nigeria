England head coach, Gareth Southgate, has explained why he left Manchester United’s Marcus Rashford out of his latest England squad. According to Southgate, Rashford is “clearly not at his best”, but insisted there is “plenty of time” for the forward to regain his place ahead of the World Cup finals.
Rashford was not included in the 25-man squad for friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast later this month. The 24-year-old has scored two goals since October 30, as he struggles to hold down a starting spot under interim boss Ralf Rangnick.
“He’s in the same position as everybody else – whether they are in the squad or they’re not.
“They’ve all got to play well over the next period towards the end of this season and in particular the beginning of next season. “It is a difficult time for him. He’s clearly not at his best.
“We know a lot about Marcus anyway, we know what he can bring to us and hopefully he can rediscover the form that we know he is capable of,” Southgate said.
