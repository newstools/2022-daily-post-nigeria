The African Democratic Congress (ADC) presidential aspirant, Kingsley Moghalu has warned that Nigeria is at the risk of being overrun by terrorism. Moghalu said this while reacting to the bandits’ attack on the Runway 05 axis of Kaduna airport on Saturday. DAILY POST reported that bandits on Saturday attacked Kaduna Airport, stopping an aircraft from taking off but were repelled by troops. However, the bandits shot and killed a staff member stationed at the perimeter fence who raised alarm on sighting the bandits. Reacting, Moghalu on Twitter suggested that the only solution to the crisis is for the government to ensure the protection of strategic national assets. His tweets read, “The reported terrorist attack on Kaduna airport highlights my statement recently that ungoverned spaces are expanding as governed (secured) spaces shrink in Nigeria. We are truly at risk of being overrun completely by terrorism. “The solution is to ensure robust protection for strategic national assets including critical infrastructures such as airports, oil production facilities etc based on a scientific understanding of terrorism, training, and equipment. This is job #1 for the next President.”
