Willie Obiano, the immediate past governor of Anambra State, has given an insight into why he tried to leave Nigeria immediately after handing over to his successor, Chukwuma Soludo. Obiano disclosed that he was rushing to meet up with a doctor’s appointment in the United States. The former governor said he was rushing to the US to treat a “semi fatal condition.” Obiano, who spoke to PremiumTimes, through his lawyer, Patrick Ikwueto, stressed that he was not running away from the country. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, had picked up Obiano at the Lagos International Airport, a few hours after he handed over to Soludo in Awka. He was, however, released by the anti-graft agency after meeting his bail conditions. However, Ikwueto said: “He was not running away. Why will he run away when his family is here and he has a lot to do here? The fact is that Obiano has a medical condition for which he had a prior appointment to see his Specialist Doctor for treatment at Spring Creek Urology Specialists L.L.C., Houston, Texas, U.S.A. “By the nature of his ailment, he has been undergoing treatment at the said Specialist Hospital since June 2021 and had an appointment earlier scheduled for the final stage of Specialist Radiography for eight (8) weeks – which will take place immediately upon his arrival at the Facility in Houston, Texas, U.S.A.; and thereafter, after four days. Subsequent treatments are scheduled every day for a period of eight (8) weeks.”
