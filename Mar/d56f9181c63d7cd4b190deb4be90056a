Rainstorms wreaked havoc in Akure, the capital of Ondo State, over the weekend, destroying properties worth millions of naira. The incident occurred on Abiodun Aloba street, off Ondo Road, in Isinkan, Akure, the State capital, with no casualties reported. Residents claimed that the rain, which started off normal, became heavy as the wind blew off roof tops, destroying everything in its path. The victims begged authorities to help them by sending a save our soul message to the Ondo State Government, as well as the National Emergency Management Agency NEMA and State Emergency Management. Princess Olamide Ajijo, whose husband’s car was wrecked in their property by the storm, spoke to reporters about the tragedy and described the situation as “extremely pitiful.” When the storm began, my husband had left the house for a meeting with landowners on the Oba-Ile axis of the state. “In fact, my husband had planned to drive to the meeting with the car, but was unable to do so due to the lingering fuel scarcity. “The storm came on abruptly, and I was attempting to keep my children from harm while the entire building was vibrating. “There was nothing I could do to relocate the car to safety, and when the storm passed, I came out to see our only car in ruins.” “My husband is a civil servant, and you all know how things are in Ondo State now, and I’m a full-time housewife and jobless, despite having a Master’s Degree in accountancy. “That car is the family’s only vehicle, and we use it primarily to transport the children to and from school, which has been wrecked by the natural disaster.” Another victim, Mama Victor, who owns a patient medicine shop, had the roof of her shop blown off with the rain damaging most of her goods. She said that the drugstore had been her family’s sole source of income for more than ten years, since her husband had lost his job.
