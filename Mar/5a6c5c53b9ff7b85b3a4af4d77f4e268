Popular Nigerian singer, Timaya, has spoken on the hit-and-run allegations levelled against him. An Instagram user identified as Osinubi Omowumi, had claimed that Timaya injured her sister after she challenged him for bashing her vehicle. It was later reported that policemen arrested the musician at his residence on Thursday. Speaking on the incident, Timaya while denying the claims, said he didn’t hit the lady. He admitted that he hit the bumper of the victim’s car and was open to fixing it until he saw she was in the company of four suspicious-looking guys. He said on Instagram, “When I got back yesterday, I told my people to go back to the hospital to get things under control. So I went to the husband’s house early this morning; they already made a police statement and all that. “I went to the hospital today, trying to make sure she’s okay come on I didn’t even know it was that bad, it was crazy. “I didn’t even expect it would be like that or whatever. I wanted her number because it was just a bumper issue, the pain I feel she felt was even more than the car or whatever came on. “How I go hit person run you know? How much is her treatment? It’s not about that it’s beyond money. It’s the act, why I go run when I saw four guys coming towards my car I gats stick out. “And again, what I was even avoiding was coming down putting me on social media and I still went on social media las las but it’s all good mehn. “I’m only here because they say I do hit and run, I’m not that guy, I can’t hit nobody and run.”
