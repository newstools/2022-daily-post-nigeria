The Nigerian Army, on Sunday, said that troops of Operation Safe Haven (OPSH), acting on credible intelligence in the early hours of Saturday, went to effect the arrest of a suspected gun-runner and fabricator in Vwang District of Jos South Local Government Area of Plateau State but were prevented by members of the community who came out en masse to protest the arrest. According to a press statement signed by OPSH Media Officer, Major Ishaku Takwa, the security operatives, who were acting on credible intelligent information, stormed the community to arrest the suspect, but unfortunately, the residents of the community blocked the road leading to the community to protest the arrest. The statement said the protesters later resorted to throwing stones and other dangerous weapons as all efforts to calm them by the soldiers failed. It added that the soldiers left the community as soon as the OPSH Commander, Maj.-Gen. Ibrahim Ali, ordered the immediate withdrawal of the troops from the community. The statement which condemned the protest in order to shield suspected criminals in their community warned the protesting community against the consequences of their action It said, “No one should be in doubt that troops would certainly effect the arrest of any person or persons suspected to be involved in any unwholesome activity considered capable of truncating the peace and security of the state and the nation at large”.
