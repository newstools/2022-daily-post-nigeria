President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine has told his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin to accept the peace-talk options, which according to him, are Russia’s only escape route from its mistakes of invasion. Zelenskyy said meaningful peace talks with Russia are Putin’s only chance to limit the damage from Russia’s mistakes in the wake of its invasion. “I want everyone to hear me now, especially in Moscow. The time has come for a meeting, it is time to talk,” he said in a video address on Friday. “The time has come to restore territorial integrity and justice for Ukraine. “Otherwise, Russia’s losses will be such that it will take you several generations to recover,” Zelensky, who is being supported by the US and its NATO allies, such as European Union, warned. Speaking further, the Ukrainian President accused Russian forces of deliberately blocking the supply of humanitarian supplies to cities under attack. “This is a deliberate tactic. This is a war crime and they will answer for it, 100%,” he said, according to Sky News.
