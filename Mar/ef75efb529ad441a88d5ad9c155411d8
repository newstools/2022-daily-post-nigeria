Chelsea legend, John Terry, has sent a clear message to whoever buys the club that he wants to see the Blues’ history and heritage protected as the West London club goes into a new era. Terry, who said Chelsea has been an important part of his life for 22 years, also backed the True Blues Consortium’s bold plans to levy funds to buy a stake in Chelsea through a community scheme. “Chelsea has been such an important part of my life for 22 years,” Terry said in a statement released to the PA news agency. “I want to see the club’s history and heritage protected as we go into a new era with like-minded people who have the same long-term vision of building the best football club in the world and understand how important our DNA is. “Having met with and heard what the True Blues Consortium is about, I know they understand. They are a group of lifelong Chelsea fans and season ticket holders who have created a concept that will complement and assist any preferred bidder running the club while adding fan connection and engagement with the board. “This innovative structure is designed to be inclusive of all Chelsea fans and protect our club. “I am thankful for the Chelsea Pitch Owners and Chelsea Supporters’ Trust’s time and support on this and we hope we will welcome investors into the club’s new structure.” Recall that Roman Abramovich had put Chelsea up for sale earlier this month amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich was sanctioned by the British Government last week, amid his alleged link to Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, Raine Group’s deadline for bids to buy Chelsea passed on Friday night, with a host of serious parties such Todd Boehly, Sir Martin Broughton and Lord Sebastian Coe, Chicago Cubs owners the Ricketts family, Saudi Media Group and British property tycoon Nick Candy all submitted their bids.
