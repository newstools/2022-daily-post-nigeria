Super Eagles interim coach, Austin Eguavoen, has singled out Black Star player, Daniel Amartey, for special praise ahead of both sides’ 2022 FIFA World Cup second leg playoff in Abuja on Tuesday. Eguavoen said Amartey was good and tough in the defence for Ghana during the first leg tie at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi on Friday. Recall that Nigeria and Ghana drew 0-0 in the World Cup playoff first-leg on Friday night. Speaking ahead of the reverse tie, Eguavoen also said his players need to take the game to the Black Stars in Abuja. “We have to take the game to Ghana. We tried to take it to them yesterday but they were tough at the back, especially the defence led by Amartey, he was good,” Eguavoen said on NFF TV. “But we had two, three clear cut chances we should have buried but we were not just calm enough in the box. But we will try to work on how we will try to give those final balls to our attackers to have easy passage to the goal.”
