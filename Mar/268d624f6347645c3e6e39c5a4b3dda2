The bill to amend the Electoral Act, 2022 has failed to the pass second reading at the Senate on Wednesday. President Muhammadu Buhari had written to the upper and lower legislative chambers seeking amendment to Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 to pave way for political office holders to serve as delegates. The section in the Electoral Act which barred political office holders from serving as delegates of political parties during conventions of political parties, Buhari said was denial of democratic rights of certain citizens. The bill was read the first time on Tuesday amid controversy banning the amendment exercise by the Justice Inyang Ekwo-led Federal High Court. Justice Ekwo ruled on the ex-parte application brought before the court by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which he ruled that the Nigerian Senate and the House of Representatives should not tamper with the amendment of 84(12) of the Electoral Amendment Act. But on Tuesday and Wednesday, Senate President, Dr. Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan insisted that lawmaking was within the powers of the parliament, hence, nothing should encumber the legislative houses from making laws. He urged the Senate leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi Abubakar to read the bill on Wednesday. The bill however, failed and by legislative processes, it won’t be read for the third time.
