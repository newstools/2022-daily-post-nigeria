Nigeria failed to beat Ghana in the first leg of their 2022 World Cup playoff on Friday night. The Super Eagles came into the game as slight favourites to win the tie over the two legs. However, the Black Stars began impressively, backed by a fully packed Babayara Stadium in Kumasi. But they failed to make their domination count and eventually Nigeria grew into the game. The Eagles thought they had the chance to win it with 12 minutes left, after the referee initially awarded a spot-kick. However, following a check on the VAR monitor, he reversed the decision. The reverse fixture will be played on Tuesday, in Abuja.
