There are indications that former Kogi West Senator, Dino Melaye has dumped his ally and ex-Senate President Bukola Saraki for Atiku Abubakar, ahead of the 2023 Presidential election. In a video that surfaced online, Melaye explained why he opted to be on the side of Atiku, a Presidential candidate on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and not Saraki. Speaking at an interaction between Atiku and some Senators in Abuja, Melaye explained that he now supports candidates and not aspirants. Melaye disclosed that his ex-colleagues in the Senate had wondered why he is supporting Atiku’s presidential ambition. Obviously dismissing Saraki, Melaye said: “When I got in here, my ex-colleague said I thought you will not be here but somewhere else. “And I told him that I have stopped following aspirants. I now follow candidates.” The former lawmaker’s remark was received with much delight of the audience, including Atiku.
