Members of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, South-South zone have demanded the party’s presidential ticket. They said the PDP should zone its presidential ticket to the South-South in the “interest of fairness, equity, and justice.” At yesterday’s summit in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital, the South-South leaders warned that the party might lose the opportunity to retake power if it failed to allow its stronghold to produce the candidate. The communique of the summit, with the theme: “Engendering a South-South agenda for 2023 and beyond,” read by the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Ndudi Elumelu, said: “The zone is fully in support of the position of the Southern Governor’s forum that the next President of Nigeria must come from the Southern part of Nigeria.” However, no aspirant in the South-South zone, apart from Dele Momodu, has indicated interest to vie. At the meeting were Governors Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom, Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State and Douye Diri of Bayelsa State. Other dignitaries in attendance included the PDP National Vice Chairman (South-South), Chief Dan Orbih, Senator George Sekibo, former Deputy House of Reps Speaker, Austin Opara, former governors Liyel Imoke (Cross River) and Celestine Omehia (Rivers). Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki was the only South-South PDP governor absent at the meeting.
