President Muhammadu Buhari’s Personal Assistant on Digital and New Media, Bashir Ahmad has reacted to the collapse of the national grid. Ahmad maintained that power has improved under Buhari’s administration. He explained that the collapse of the power grid was caused by a weak transmission system which was inherited from the previous administration. In a tweet, the Presidential aide recalled that Nigeria experienced four collapses in 2020 and 42 in 2010. According to Ahmad: “When we’re ready to have this convo, we’ll know that the power sector has improved under this administration. “Grid collapse is usually caused by a weak transmission system (inherited). Intensive work being done to fix that is obvious. We had 4 collapses in 2020, we recorded 42 in 2010.” The national grid collapsed at 10.40 a.m on Monday resulting in blackouts in some parts of the country. Barely 24 hours later, some parts of the country were on Tuesday thrown into darkness following another system collapse. Mr Felix Ofulue, Head, Corporate Communications, Ikeja Electric Plc, confirmed the development to the News Agency of Nigeria in Lagos.
