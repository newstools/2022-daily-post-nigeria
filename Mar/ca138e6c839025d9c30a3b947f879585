The Delta State Police Command has arrested two suspects in connection with the gruesome murder of an Army Officer, Lt. Musa in Enerhen, Uvwie Local Government Area of the state. The Delta State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Bright Edafe, told DAILY POST that the “two suspects have been arrested.” According to him, “I didn’t say they were the ones that killed the Army Officer. I am not the one to say so.” Our correspondent earlier reported that the deceased, who was the Head of Operations of the Nigerian Army, 3 Battalion in Effurun, was shot dead by gunmen on Friday, March 11 along Enerhen road. It was learnt that the deceased was in his private car when the gunmen accosted and shot him to death. He has since been buried in line with Muslim rites. The incident has, however, caused serious tension within Effurun and its environs as security operatives have launched a manhunt for the suspected gunmen.
