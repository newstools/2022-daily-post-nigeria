The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has counseled students across Nigeria to steer clear of cybercrimes and related offences. The Kano Zonal Commander, Farouq Dogondaji gave the advice when students of Prime College, Kano, visited the agency on an excursion. The official noted that peer pressure and bad influences were responsible for indulgence of youths in fraud. Dogondaji begged them to always choose their friends wisely and carefully. The commander said they would meet people with different backgrounds when they get admitted into the university. “Some people will tell you that you don’t need to depend on your parents, and tell you to start doing like big boys. “They will eventually lure you into the activities of these cyber criminals. Please don’t listen to them”, he appealed.
