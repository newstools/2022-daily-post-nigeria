Netherlands defender, Virgil van Dijk, has urged Mohamed Salah to use Egypt’s 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification failure as motivation to win trophies for Liverpool this season. Van Dijk also warned Sadio Mane that he might need luck if Senegal are in the same group as the Netherlands in the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar later this year. Mane led Senegal to beat Salah-Egypt in a 2022 FIFA World Cup playoff on Tuesday in Dakar. The forward scored the winning goal in a penalty shootout to ensure Senegal beat Egypt 3-1 after both legs ended in a 1-1 aggregate. Speaking after Egypt’s defeat to Senegal, Van Dijk said at his post-match press conference after Netherlands international friendly 1-1 draw against Germany on Tuesday, “‘Did he lose? Well, obviously, I feel sorry for Mo and for Egypt, but football is sometimes like this,” Van Dijk said. “I am sure he will turn the disappointment into success for the rest of the season. We still have everything to play for, so there are a lot of things still to achieve for him. “As for Sadio, I wish him all the best and if he is in our group, he is going to need that good luck.”
