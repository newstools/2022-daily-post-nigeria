Brazil legend, Ronaldo Nazario, has hailed Xavi Hernandez’s impact at Barcelona after their 4-0 LaLiga El Clasico thrashing of Real Madrid over the weekend. Barcelona defeated Real Madrid, thanks to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s brace and a goal each from Ronald Araujo and Ferran Torres. But Ronaldo said he loved watching LaLiga as Barcelona defeated Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu, adding that the Blaugrana have improved a lot since Xavi’s arrival. Speaking to Barca TV (as quoted by Forbes), Ronaldo, who spent a prolific season at the Nou Camp before going on to enjoy a fantastic five-year spell at Real Madrid, said: “I follow Spanish football and I love it. With the crisis that Barca has had very recently, they have improved a lot with the arrival of Xavi. Now I have seen a great team live, a very aggressive and vertical team, which presses with the traditional qualities of Barca.” The two-time FIFA World Cup winner added: “Football is not as simple as people think. Managing a dressing room, managing people, it entails problems and you have to know how to manage it well. Xavi is doing very well.”
