The clampdown on criminals by the Kwara State Government in three local government areas of the state has yielded results with the arrest of seven suspected criminals in Ekiti Local Government Area of the state on Monday. A combined team of local vigilantes and hunters arrested the seven suspected criminals in Ekiti Local Government Area of the state. The suspects were arrested following the clampdown on criminals hideouts by security operatives comprising the army, police, civil defence corps and other security agencies in three local governments of the state at the weekend. DAILY POST recalls that the state government, in collaboration with security agencies, recently launched an offensive mission in Kaiama, Baruten and Ekiti Local Government Areas in the efforts to smoke criminals out of the areas for the safety of lives and property of the citizens. DAILY POST gathered that the seven suspected criminals have been transferred to the state Police Headquarters Ilorin. Efforts to reach the spokesman of the state police command, Mr Okasanmi Ajayi in Ilorin on Tuesday proved abortive at the time of this report.
