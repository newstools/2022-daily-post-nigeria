The Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) says about N35.3billion have been disbursed to 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to mitigate COVID-19 impact. Team Leader, Physical Implementation Support Mission for NG-CARES Programme, Prof. Yusuf Suleiman gave the figures on Friday. Suleiman spoke during a courtesy visit to Kebbi Governor Atiku Bagudu at the Government House in the capital Birnin Kebbi. In February, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo launched the World Bank-financed Nigeria COVID-19 Action Recovery and Economic Stimulus (NG-CARES) with $750million loans. The funds aisist states in their efforts to mitigate the effects of the socio-economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. “As of last week, we were able to disburse N35.3billion to states out of which Kebbi received N900million”, NAN quoted Suleiman saying. “The review that we did was a desk review. What you saw on paper was far below the level of what had been achieved at the state level.” The official noted that states are expected to deliver on results first before the money could be reimbursed. Suleiman said what has been given to the 36 governments and the FCT should be recouped fully in the next six months. He warned that if a state was unable to achieve results beyond the N900million received, doing so would be difficult going forward.
