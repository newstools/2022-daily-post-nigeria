Citizens were stranded on Tuesday as bandits targeted Tsafe-Yankara road and Kaduna-Abuja highway. Sporadic gunshots forced drivers and commuters to stop as they await the intervention of government forces. The attack occurred barely 24 hours after an Abuja-Kaduna bound train was bombed with Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). The number of fatalities is yet to be confirmed in the ambush that left several injured. About 1,000 people were on board. Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Farouq Yahaya visited the scene, assuring that those kidnapped would be freed. The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba was also at the location where the train was immobilized between Katari and Rijana. Police spokesman Muyiwa Adejobi said the security chiefs got first-hand information necessary for rejigging of operational strategy for a robust action plan to prevent a recurrence.
