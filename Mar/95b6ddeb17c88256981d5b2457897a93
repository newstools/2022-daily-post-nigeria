An Osun State High Court sitting in Ikirun has on Monday affirmed the ward congress conducted by the national leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state. According to the ruling, “It is only the National Executive Committee, either acting through itself or through the National Working Committee, in line with Article 29(2), 51(1), 2(b), (e) and 3 of the constitution of the Peoples Democratic Party, 2017 that can validly conduct and supervise the holden of ward congress to elect ward executive committee/officers of the party, 3-man ad-hoc ward delegates.” Also, the order of the court mandated the respondent to make use of the Osun PDP ward delegate list containing the names of ward executive committee who were elected at the ward congress held on September 25, 2021, and duly ratified at the National Convention in 2021 for the purpose of Osun PDP gubernatorial primary slated for March 8, 2022. DAILY POST gathered that the court order has finally put a rest to confusion arising from argument to use the old delegates list which was challenged in the court by some aggrieved members of the party. The PDP delegates will on Tuesday, March 8, 2022, elect the flagbearer of the party at the Osogbo City Stadium. The aspirants jostling for the party’s ticket are Senator Ademola Adeleke, who has the backing of Sunday Bisi, and Dotun Babayemi who has the backing of the Wale Ojo led faction of the party in the state. Fatai Akinbade, Dele Adeleke, Sanya Omirin and Akin Ogunbiyi, have all withdrawn from the race on Monday, saying that the leadership of the Wale Ojo faction demanded a consensus candidate to square up with Adeleke.
