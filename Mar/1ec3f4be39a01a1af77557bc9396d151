A United States, US, Republican Senator, Lindsey Graham, has called for the assassination of Russian President, Vladimir Putin, following the invasion of Ukraine. Graham said Putin’s assassination is the only way to end the ongoing war in Ukraine. Speaking with Fox News TV, the Senator said somebody should assassinate Putin in Moscow. According to Graham: “How does this end? Somebody in Russia has to step up to the plate… and take this guy out. “The only people who can fix this are the Russian people.” Referring to the assassination of a former Roman emperor, Julius Caesar, Graham said: “Is there a Brutus in Russia?” He wondered if “a more successful Colonel Stauffenberg” existed in the Russian military, alluding to the German officer whose bomb failed to kill Adolf Hitler in 1944. “You would be doing your country — and the world — a great service,” he added.
