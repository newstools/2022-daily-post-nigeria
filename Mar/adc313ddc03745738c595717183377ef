Hollywood actress, Tiffany Haddish has defended Will Smith for slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars 2022. The crowd was stunned on Sunday night when Will Smith walked up and slapped Rock for making a joke about his wife Jada Pinkett Smith’s bald head. Haddish, reacting called Smith’s action ‘the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.’ The 42-year-old actress presented the Best International Feature Film award with Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings star Simu Liu, which was won by Japan’s Drive My Car. ‘When I saw a Black man stand up for his wife. That meant so much to me ” And maybe the world might not like how it went down, but for me, it was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen because it made me believe that there are still men out there that love and care about their women, their wives,” Haddish said. She queried why Rock who is a ‘friend’ to both Will and Jada, would do that. “He didn’t even run the joke by her, but she was hurt though. ”If she wouldn’t have been hurt, Will probably would not have said nothing but you could see he was clearly and they exploited it. They exploited her, so “I have to do something”… He protected his wife,” Haddish added. Pinkett Smith has been dealing with alopecia, an autoimmune condition that causes loss of hair, since 2018.
