A High Court sitting in Osun State has affirmed Dotun Babayemi as the authentic gubernatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the State. Recall that Senator Ademola Jackson Adeleke won the primary held at Osogbo Township Stadium, supervised by the PDP primary election committee, while Babayemi emerged from the parallel gubernatorial primary at WOCDIF Centre, Ring Road, Osogbo. The court, in a ruling, held that the 215 Wards Executive Officers that participated in the parallel gubernatorial primary held at WOCDIF Centre were authentic and authorized Ward Executive Officers permitted to vote as delegates. Also, the Court presided by Justice Adeyinka Aderibigbe, granted an Order of Mandatory Interim Injunction restraining the defendants/respondents from recognizing any other governorship primaries of the PDP in Osun State. It ordered the PDP and the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, not to recognise any other governorship candidate aside from Babayemi. The court stressed that the exercise embarked upon by the National Working Committee of the PDP on Saturday at the stadium where Senator Ademola Adeleke emerged was null and void. Justice Aderibigbe further ruled that the action taken by NWC of the party is in flagrant disobedience to its judgement on November 22, 2021, which recognized the Ward Executive Officers who produced delegates for the primaries.
