Nigerian midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, will not play for Leicester City when they take on Manchester United in a Premier League tie on Saturday. Leicester City manager, Brendan Rodgers confirmed that Ndidi would miss the remainder of the season due to injury. Ndidi was forced off injured in the second half of Leicester City’s Europa Conference League tie against Rennes earlier this month and has since had surgery. He also missed Nigeria’s 2022 FIFA World Cup double-leg playoff against the Black Stars of Ghana. Providing an update on his squad ahead of their Premier League fixture with Man United, Rodgers said: “Wilfred Ndidi will be out for the season, it’s a shame for us, but he will get ready for next season. “It’s unfortunate. He’s been a brilliant player for me in my time here. He picked up a nasty injury that has had to have surgery on and he will recover now until June.”
