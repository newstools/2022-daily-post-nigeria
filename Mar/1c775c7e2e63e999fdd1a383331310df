The Chairman of the New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP, Hisham Habib, says there will be no automatic ticket for the incoming members of the party in Kano State. He said this in a statement issued to newsmen. This is coming amid speculation over the possibility of decamping of the former Governor of Kano State, Dr Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, and his supporters from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) into the party. The chairman said the party’s door is always open to receive any patriotic Nigerian who means good for citizens. “We are going to work with the incoming members in achieving the objectives of the great party,” Habib said. He, therefore, urged the national headquarters to formalize all mergers and alliances with groups coming into the party. He also explained that no automatic ticket is guaranteed for incoming members but that card-carrying members can contest for positions as stipulated in the party’s constitution.
