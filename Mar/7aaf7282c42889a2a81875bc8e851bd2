Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar will declare his intention to run for president in 2023 on Wednesday, 23 March, 2022. This is coming after several months of consultations with stakeholders across the country and in the diaspora, as well as all organs of the PDP. Atiku’s media office in a statement on Sunday said the event will have Atiku Abubakar’s friends, associates, political leaders, party faithful and supporters. According to the statement, the event will take place at the International Conference Center, Abuja at 11 am. The statement partly read “His official declaration kick-starts the former Vice President’s participation in the race for the presidential ticket of the PDP ahead of the next year’s general election.” DAILY POST last week reported that Atiku, the 2019 presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), picked the nomination and expression of interest forms of the PDP, which were donated to him by the North East Business Community, urging him to run for president in the 2023 election.
