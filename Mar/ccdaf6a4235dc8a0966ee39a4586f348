Kidnappers on Thursday morning stormed Agunu Dutse, Agunu Ward of Kachia Local Government Area of Kaduna State and reportedly abducted about 46 people. A resident of the area, Mr. Dauda Mustapha, who said he miraculously escaped from the attack, told DAILY POST on Thursday that the kidnappers, numbering over 100 with sophisticated weapons, stormed the community around 12.30 am. Also, another resident of the community, Master Maurice Clement Tanko (Galadiman Agunu Dutse), said it was a horrible experience. He said the community volunteers first noticed the presence of bandits through an unusual movement in the outskirts of the community. He said the bandits operated for about 10-20 minutes and gradually withdrew as they noticed that the vigilantes were on alert. According to him, a member of the community, Abubakar Sule, was injured during the attack and was taken to the hospital for treatment. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, ASP Muhammed Jalige, did not respond to his calls and the text message sent to him.
