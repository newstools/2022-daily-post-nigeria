Gov. Nasir El-Rufa’i of Kaduna State on Thursday restated his call for massive bombardment of all forests inhabited by terrorists, NAN reports. He said this would contain the current security challenges in the country. The governor made the call at a stakeholders meeting in Giwa, Kaduna State, where terrorists had been invading communities in the last five days, with several people killed or kidnapped. “We have been pressing for the past two years for the military from the air and the ground to bomb these forests while soldiers on the ground kill all those that escape the bomb. “I do not believe that there is any innocent person in the forest. “It is my intention to see Mr President to reiterate this and to also ask that a military theatre command headquarters be established for the Northwest geo-political zone,’’ he said. According to the governor, the magnitude of the present security challenges in the Northwest is much more than what was witnessed in the Northeast. He said farming had become impossible while lives were being lost to incessant attacks by terrorists. “It is time for the Nigeria Air Force and Nigerian Army to bomb the terrorists out of existence. “With the declaration by the Federal High Court that these bandits are terrorists, there is need for security agencies to take extreme actions to terminate these bandits,’’ El-Rufa’i stressed.
