Raine Group, a US based investment bank, has whittled down all the interested parties in buying Chelsea Football Club to a shortlist of four. According to The Athletic, the shortlisted bids are from Todd Boehly, David Blitzer and Josh Harris, the Ricketts family and Boston Celtics owner Stephen Pagliuca. This comes a day after The Saudi Media Group was dropped by the American bank. Raine Group communicated the decision to the group on behalf of Chelsea. Russian billionaire, Roman Abramovich, put the Premier League club up for sale after he was sanctioned by the UK government. Submission of bids to buy the Stamford Bridge outfit ended last Friday. Chelsea’s sale price is expected to break the £3billion barrier, making the West London club the richest sale in sporting history.
