A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in the Southwest, Chief Bode George has disclosed why he is against Bola Tinubu, an All Progressives Congress, APC, Presidential aspirant, becoming Nigeria’s president in 2023. George said Tinubu had completely taken over the resources of Lagos State. He, however, stressed that he has nothing personal against the APC national leader. George said the former governor of Lagos State should allow power to change hands because he has been in charge for too long. Appearing on Channels TV’s Politics Today on Tuesday, the PDP chieftain said: “He has completely annexed the resources of my State. “I have absolutely no personal grudge against Tinubu. What I have against him is the plundering of the finances of the State. “Which country will have the Internal Revenue Service and will now set up a company solely owned by him and his cronies, collecting the taxes of the people on behalf of the Internal Revenue Service, how? This doesn’t make any sense. “This fellow has plundered and mismanaged the finances of this State to a stupor that calls for attention.”
