The Majority Leader of the House of Representatives, Alhassan Ado Doguwa, has called for Nigerians to be allowed to carry firearms to protect themselves. Dogwa, a member of the All Progressives Congress, stated this on Thursday while speaking on a motion of urgent public importance moved by Shehu Balarabe. Balarabe had moved a motion on the killing of 150 persons in Birni Gwari in Kaduna State. Also speaking on the motion, Ahmed Nasir, a member of the APC from Kano State, also called for the sack of the National Security Adviser, Mohammed Monguno over the spate of killings in Nigeria. Mr Ahmed said if the House could demand the sacking of the service chiefs, Mr Monguno should not be spared. “The only thing i will say is that, if the service chiefs can be changed, i see no reason why he (NSA) cannot be changed,” he said. Idris Wase, the deputy speaker, who presided over the session, blamed the judiciary for not being fast with the prosecution of accused bandits. “I want to beg—we share the concern of what is happening. We asked for the change of service chiefs, they have been changed, what has it changed. Go back to the judiciary. Of all the kidnappers, how many have been prosecuted,” he stated. Jaha Ahmed also accused the military of deliberately prolonging the war because of huge money appropriated for security. Another lawmaker, Dachung Bagos, asked the House to suspend the allocation of money to the military until all the army and other security agencies account for monies given to them. Following the debate, the Deputy Speaker moved for the suspension of all legislative activities till Tuesday.
