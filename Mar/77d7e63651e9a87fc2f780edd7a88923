In an apparent move to fight back, the former Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, Mahdi Aliyu Gusau has picked the expression of interest and nomination forms to contest the 2023 governorship election on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Gusau who was impeached in February 2022, will be contesting against his former principal, Governor Bello Matawalle. Matawalle will be seeking re-election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). DAILY POST also recalls that both Matawalle and Aliyu had by providence assumed office under the platform of the PDP but Matawalle citing security constraints defected to the ruling APC on June 28, 2021. The development led to a strain in their relationship as Aliyu failed to defect with him. Making the announcement of Gusau’s entry into the race, the PDP wrote “The Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, Aliyu Mohammed Gusau, has obtained his expression of Interest and nomination forms to contest the Gubernatorial Election in Zamfara State in 2023”.
