The Jigawa State High Court sitting in Birnin Kudu on Friday sentenced one Isa Ibrahim to life imprisonment for raping two sisters at Kwari Village of Birnin Kudu Local Government. Prosecution counsel, Shu’aibu Aminu narrated to the court that the defendant, Ibrahim of Kwari Village, was arraigned before the court on 26th September 2018 for luring a 4 and 5-year-old girl to his farm and having sexual intercourse with them. He said it was the mother of the victims who reported the case to the police and the suspect was arrested, and after investigation, he was charged to court for rape. Aminu presented five witnesses and tendered two exhibits. Presiding Judge, Justice Musa Ubale, said rape is contrary to Section 282 (1)(e) of the Jigawa State Penal Code Law (Miscellaneous Amendment), 2014. Justice Musa, therefore, found that the prosecution counsel had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt and sentenced the accused to life imprisonment.
