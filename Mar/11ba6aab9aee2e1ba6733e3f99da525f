Former Chelsea and Juventus striker, Gonzalo Higuain has tipped Paris Saint-Germain’s Kylian Mbappe and Borussia Dortmund’s Erling Haaland to take over from Lionel Messi, and Cristiano Ronaldo in the near future. Higuain, who currently plays his club football for Inter Miami, believes Mbappe and Haaland have all the characteristics to succeed Ronaldo and Messi. Messi and Ronaldo, two of the greatest players of the 21st century, are well into their 30s and are in the twilight of their careers. The pair have won 12 Ballon d’ Or awards among themselves. “Kylian Mbappe has all the characteristics. I believe that Leo and Cristiano at some point will stop playing because life is like that, and Mbappe and Haaland will be their successors,” Higuain told Stats Perform. Mbappe and Haaland could play in La Liga in the near future, just like Messi and Ronaldo did. The France international has been heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid in the summer of 2022, while Haaland has been linked with a move to Barcelona. Mbappe has scored 24 goals in 34 appearances for PSG across all competitions so far this season, while Haaland has scored 23 times for Dortmund in 20 matches in all competitions.
