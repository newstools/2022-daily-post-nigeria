The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has declared himself a youth. The former Lagos State Governor said he still possesses the physical and mental energy to lead the country come 2023. There has been a clamour for a younger person to become the President of the country after 79-year-old President Muhammadu Buhari is adjudged to have taken the country backwards, especially due to his frail health. Recall that the APC National Leader had during his visit to Lamidi Adeyemi, the Alaafin of Oyo, at his palace last week, asked the youths to create room for elderly people. Then speaking while meeting with some APC members and his supporters over the weekend, the 69-year-old former federal lawmaker, declared that he is now a youth. Tinubu, in a viral video on social media, said he is capable of serving Nigeria and making the country great. “I’m here standing before you and I’m a youth,” Tinubu said, adding that the youth themselves would have to be ready to take the mantle of leadership of the country. The declaration was followed by loud jeers from the crowd, who shouted “National youth leader”, “youth leader” and so on.
