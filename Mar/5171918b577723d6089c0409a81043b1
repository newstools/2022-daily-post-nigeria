Former Liverpool winger, John Barnes has defended Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel over his decision to allow former striker Tammy Abraham leave the club. The England international left Chelsea for Roma in the summer of 2021 and has consistently impressed in Italy. He scored 30 goals in 82 appearances for Chelsea but was deemed surplus to requirements after Romelu Lukaku’s £97.5m return to west London from Inter Milan. Abraham has scored 17 goals in Serie A this season despite Roma’s inconsistent form. Bannes, a former England international, told BonusCodeBets: “Chelsea didn’t make a mistake by letting Tammy Abraham go, despite the fact he’s scored more than all their strikers combined this season. “Abraham wasn’t scoring for Chelsea. Just because a player is doing well elsewhere doesn’t mean a club made a mistake in letting them go. “Obviously, the club he’s currently at, Roma, just suits him more. “Arsenal didn’t make a mistake in moving Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang on, just because he’s scored six goals in seven games for Barcelona. It just wasn’t happening for Tammy at Chelsea.”
