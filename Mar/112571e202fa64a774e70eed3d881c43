Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has warned the club’s new owners about the high expectations at Stamford Bridge. Over 200 interested parties have submitted bids to buy the Blues before Friday’s 9pm deadline. It’s been a difficult time for the Premier League side after Roman Abramovich was hit with government sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But Tuchel’s men have been able to put those off-field distractions to the back of their mind, securing five straight wins since the restrictions were imposed. The German believes Chelsea demands a certain state of mind for everyone working at the club. Tuchel said: “The responsibility and the attitude come with what you sign up for. This is what you have to deal with. Nobody could imagine that we have to deal with the political circumstances in Europe, and a change of ownership. “But when I had my talks it was very clear what Chelsea demands of you. It will be with the new owner and was with the last owner. Once you are in this level it’s always the same. You have to prove yourself and earn the right to be in the place where you are because it is a privileged place.”
