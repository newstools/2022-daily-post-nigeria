A former Adamawa State governorship aspirant under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr Umar Ardo, has moved to the Social Democratic Party (SDP). Ardo, whose years in the PDP were characterised by many verbal, court and other forms of fights with the party leadership, became the founder of what he named Reformed PDP (rPDP), which he led before he finally left the party on Sunday. In a letter of resignation that he sent to the chairman of Yelli ward of PDP in Jada Local Government Area of Adamawa, Ardo said he could not continue to romance a party that is disrespectful to its own constitution. “My decision is compelled by the perennial acts of impunity, injustice and dishonesty on the part of the party,” he said. Ardo, whose critics consider too restless to be in a party where his views are not questioned, said rather proudly that he had taken the PDP to court eleven times in the past10 years, with three of the cases reaching the Supreme Court. “For over a decade, I have been battling with the party in and out of the court of law in an effort of getting things right but the PDP has refused to comply with the rule of law,” he said, adding,“ I have therefore withdrawn my membership of the PDP.” Ardo, who formally joined the SDP in Yelli ward on Sunday, said he intends to use it as a vehicle to “rescue the state from the impunity of PDP” by vying for the position of governor. While receiving Ardo into the SDP, chairman of the party in Yelli ward, Saidu Hamidu said the defection of Ardo marked a milestone in the life of the party. Ardo is considered a favourite to land the party’s ticket for the 2023 governorship election.
