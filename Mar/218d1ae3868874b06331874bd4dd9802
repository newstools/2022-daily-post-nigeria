Super Eagles assistant captain, William Troost-Ekong, has named Odion Ighalo and Emmanuel Denis among the strikers he is banking on to see off Ghana in Abuja on Tuesday. Nigeria will face Ghana again on Tuesday for the reversed fixture of the 2022 World Cup playoff at the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja. Victor Osimhen, who led the lines for the Super Eagles on Friday night, was not able to find the back of the net in Friday’s night’s goalless draw in Kumasi. Troost-Ekong said he is not worried about Nigeria not scoring in back-to-back games. “You can look at it two ways, You are missing some of the guys that came in Dennis, and Ighalo. These are all players known to score goals and I would back them. “I think they are going to feel even more challenged to score and show everybody that they can do that. “I’m not worried about that at all. I see them in training everyday and what they have done in the Nigeria jersey so it’s just a matter of time and the statistics will be in our favour. “If they haven’t scored for so long, now they are probably going to score in Abuja.”
