Former Real Madrid striker, Antonio Cassano has admitted that Napoli’s Victor Osimhen has cleared his doubts. Cassano stated this while speaking on Bobo TV via Tutto Napoli. According to the Italian, he had doubts about Osimhen’s quality when he came to the Serie A, but he’s been proven wrong game after game. “The header scored by Osimhen is incredible, it looked like a missile. ”Napoli went to a tremendous stadium and played a great match as a great team that wants to stay connected to the others. Juventus suffered more with Sampdoria than Napoli with Hellas. “Osimhen? I did not believe in his potential, I had many doubts and instead with the passing of the games, I can say that I realized that he can become a top player in the world,” Cassano said.
