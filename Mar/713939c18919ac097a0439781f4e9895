The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has raised alarm over an alleged plot by the Presidency and the All Progressives Congress (APC) to alter the newly passed Electoral Act 2022 to introduce clauses that will compromise the 2023 general elections. PDP in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, Wednesday said, ” the APC, having realized that it is running out of time and cannot meet up with the already released electoral timetable now seeks to frustrate and derail the ongoing electoral process”. The major opposition party said it on good authority gathered that the Buhari led Presidency has perfected plots to use the new APC leadership in the National Assembly to allegedly orchestrate an amendment to the Electoral Act to create an opening for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to alter its already released 2023 Election Timetable and Schedule of Activities to accommodate the APC. Our Party has information about how the APC has been mounting pressure on INEC to push forward the already scheduled dates for the 2023 general elections. PDP rejects the alleged plot by the APC to shift the goal post in the middle of the game and cautioned INEC to resist such a heinous design against democracy, the party said. The party insisted that the election timetable has already been released, political parties have commenced processes, Nigerians have since set their minds on the election dates to vote out the APC and there is no going back on that resolve. The opposition party cautioned the Presidency and the APC leadership in the National Assembly to note that any attempt to alter the timetable is an invitation to a serious political crisis in the country as Nigerians will firmly resist them. It also directed all PDP members in the National Assembly to be vigilant and firmly resist this plot, and urged the Civil Society, the media, Organized Labour and the International Community to stand against this attempt by the APC to derail the democratic process. The party said it will not hesitate to call out millions of its members, teeming supporters of the Party and Nigerians at large should the APC continue in this nefarious scheme.
