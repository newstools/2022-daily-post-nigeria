Ex-Manchester United defender, Mikael Silvestre, has insisted that the club re-signing Cristiano Ronaldo has not backfired. The 37-year-old returned to Old Trafford last summer, putting pen to paper on a two-year deal after leaving Juventus. So far, Ronaldo has netted 15 times in all competitions and is United’s top scorer. However, some critics claim his presence has made the team go backwards. Having finished as runners-up in the Premier League last term, Ronaldo’s arrival was seen as the final piece in the jigsaw. However, United are way off the top and facing a battle to finish in the top four. Since the start of 2022, Ronaldo has scored just one goal in his last 10 appearances and was dropped for the recent draw with Burnley. But Silvestre, who played almost 140 times with Ronaldo during his first stint in English football, told BettingExpert: “It’s normal [that he gets criticism] because with the name he carries, the expectation must be high, so it’s normal that he’ll get some stick. “The statistics this season are in his favour, especially with the team’s current form. “It’s been a positive signing, even with the run of games where he hasn’t been scoring, but it happens. He’s Ronaldo… he’s not God!”
