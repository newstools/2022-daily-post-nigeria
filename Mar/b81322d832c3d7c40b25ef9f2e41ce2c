Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, has said he is expecting to have Edinson Cavani available for the trip to Manchester City on Sunday. The Uruguay striker has not played for the Red Devils since the 1-1 draw at Burnley on February 8 because of a groin injury. However, Cavani has returned to full training with the rest of the squad ahead of the derby. “He has been back in training since yesterday [Thursday],” Rangnick said. “Today was his second session. He looks good so I think he could at least be part of the group for Sunday. “There are two or three question marks behind some players and we will have to wait and see what happens. Edinson as it stands now will be part of the group.”
