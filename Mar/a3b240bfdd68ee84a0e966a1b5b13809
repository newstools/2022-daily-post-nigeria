United States of America has warned its citizens against fighting on Ukraine’s side against Russia in the ongoing war. US warned that citizens who travel to Ukraine and fight with Ukrainian forces will be treated by Russians as “mercenaries” or foreign fighters. State Department Spokesperson, Ned Price said this during a press briefing on Friday, recalling that Russia had already stated this, adding that this puts the US fighters at a greater risk of mistreatment. Price warned that US citizens could also face criminal prosecution, capture or death from Russia for volunteering to fight on Ukraine’s side. The Spokesman said there are also no plans evacuating its citizens from Ukraine at any point. “US citizens who travel to Ukraine, especially with the purpose of participating and fighting there, they face significant risks, including the very real risk of capture or death,” said, according to CNN. “The United States, as you know, is not able to provide assistance to evacuate US citizens from Ukraine, including those Americans who may decide to travel to Ukraine to participate in the ongoing war,” Price said. The State Department, however, said that US citizens can only assist Ukraine constructively by providing humanitarian assistance. “We continue to urge US citizens not to travel to Ukraine for their safety, regardless of the underlying purpose,” he said.
