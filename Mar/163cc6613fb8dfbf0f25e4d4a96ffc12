Canada women national team have confirmed they will play Nigeria twice in friendly matches in April. The games have been arranged to celebrate the North American ladies’ triumph at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo last August. Canada, who are ranked sixth in the world, clinched their first-ever gold medal at the tournament, seeing off Sweden in a penalty shoot-out. Nigeria has now reached an agreement to join in the Canadians’ celebratory tour. The first game will take place on April 8 in Vancouver, while the second match will be played three days later, on April 11, at the Starlight Stadium in Langford. Canada’s head coach, Beverly Priestman, told CBC: “I was over the moon to get Nigeria over the line. “We haven’t got a lot of experience against African nations, so for me, playing Nigeria, we haven’t played them a lot, but we know they’re an unbelievable team, and it’ll be a great experience for us to keep pushing forward on our new journey.”
