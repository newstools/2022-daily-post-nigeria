Former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, on Sunday declared that the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was the only option to rescue Nigeria from collapsing. Saraki made the declaration in Bauchi when he and Sokoto State governor, Aminu Bello Tambuwal, visited Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed, on a consultative visit. According to Saraki, Nigerians were going through a lot of hardship with high cost of living, adding that only PDP could provide new hope for the people. He informed that they were in Bauchi to confer with Governor Mohammed with a view to putting heads together to come up with workable solutions capable of uniting their party ahead of the 2023 general elections. “Looking at what is currently happening in the country. Our concern is the hardship the people of the country are going through, the cost of living and also looking ahead towards 2023. “Our concern is that, it is very clear that PDP is the only viable option to rescue this country and to provide new hope and as such, as key stakeholders of this party, we feel the need to sit down and see how best we can give leadership and direction. “In so doing, we met and discussed that with 2023 ahead of us, in trying to rescue this country, the unity of the country, the stability of the country and the growth of the country is more important than individual ambitions. Hence, the need for us to work together. “We believe that if the three of us, that is myself, Governor Tambuwal and Governor Mohammed, are working together harmoniously, committed and with a lot of energy, there will be great hope for this country going ahead,” Saraki told journalists. According to Saraki, “we have all seen that APC is no longer a party. It is having challenges of administering its party and anybody that cannot administer right, cannot administer the country. “So the only option left for Nigerians is PDP. We believe because of that level of responsibility, we must bury our personal ambition.”
