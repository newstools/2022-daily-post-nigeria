Arsenal legend, Martin Keown, has warned that his former club could still lose out on finishing in the top four places. The Gunners bounced back from their 1-0 defeat to Liverpool in midweek to beat Aston Villa 1-0 at Villa Park on Saturday. The win opened a four-point gap between Mikel Arteta’s men and Manchester United in fifth place. However, Keown feels that their North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur who are currently seventh with 48 points, could clinch the last Champions League spot. “Now there’s a lot of games ahead and I still put Spurs as favourites to make top four. Let’s see if they can do it. Arsenal, we have now got to see, but when I look at the fixtures and I see games away at Chelsea, Spurs, it’s tough. It’s in Arsenal’s hands and if they keep performing as they are they can do it. “I don’t want to put too much pressure on the Arsenal players. I said they are rebuilding their reputation and sometimes they’ve been guilty of too many pats on the back and they’ve lost concentration. Is it different now? They have to show it,” Keown said.
