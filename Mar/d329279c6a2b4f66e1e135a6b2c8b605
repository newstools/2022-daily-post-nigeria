Prophet Bisi Olujobi of Wisdom Church International Ketu, Lagos, has revealed God’s plan for Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous people of Biafra, IPOB, and Sunday Igboho, Yoruba Nation agitator. Olujobi disclosed that God will use Kanu and Igboho for a purpose in the nearest future. In a press conference over the weekend, the clergyman urged Nigerians not to see Kanu and Igboho as “bandits” causing trouble. He also disclosed that God revealed that Kanu would soon be released. According to Olujobi, Kanu can only be released through prayer because some forces are against his freedom. He said: “God told me that Kanu would be released, but they need to pray more. All these things we are talking about are not ordinary; there are some forces behind it. “Only through prayer can shake those forces away; with prayer, things will work well. “God wants to use Sunday Igboho, Kanu for a purpose. We should not see them as one of the bandits causing problems, but God revealed them to me that he used them as a sign for the future plan. “
