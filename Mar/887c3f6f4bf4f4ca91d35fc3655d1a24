Former Nigerian striker, Jonathan Akpoborie, has said he expects the three-time African champions to qualify for Qatar 2022. Akpoborie was reacting to the Super Eagles’ squad list released by interim coach, Augustine Eguavoen, on Friday, ahead of the playoffs against Ghana later this month. Eguavoen handed debut call-ups to Leicester City winger Lookman Ademola and former U17 star Akinkunmi Amoo in his provisional 32-man squad. Akpoborie, speaking with Complete Sports, expressed his excitement with the players invited. “I am really excited with the list of invited players for the 2022 World Cup playoff against the Black Stars of Ghana. I am also delighted with the invitations of few fresh faces in the team and I think the selection of players has been spot on for Eguavoen. “This clearly shows the coaches’ vision and plan for the game against Ghana and I am so happy with the first move with the list. I expect the team to qualify ahead of Ghana regardless of their antics against us,” he said.
