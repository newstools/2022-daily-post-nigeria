Justice Emeka Nwite of the Federal High Court in Abuja has refused the request for bail made by two Inspectors of Police – Simon Agirgba and John Nuhu – charged with suspended DCP Abba Kyari on offences of illegal dealing in drugs. Justice Nwite, in a ruling on Monday, held that the prosecution has successfully established why bail should not be granted to the two defendants. The judge held that having considered the affidavit evidence supplied by parties and proof of evidence, he was convinced that the prosecution has successfully raised a reasonable presumption of criminal responsibility on the part of the defendants. Justice Nwite granted an accelerated hearing of the case. In the two rulings read by the judge on Monday morning, he declined bail to Kyari, Ubua, Agirgba and Nuhu. Details later.
