A village, Unguwan Bulus, in Zaman Dabo community, Atyap Chiefdom in Zangon Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State was on Monday night attacked by suspected Fulani militias killing about six persons, injuring others and set houses as well as valuables ablaze. The suspected Fulani militias were said to have invaded the village in large numbers with sophisticated weapons while the villagers were asleep. A source told DAILY POST that one of the attacked is critically injured and is presently receiving treatment in a hospital. According to the source, the suspected Fulani militias came around 10 pm and started shooting sporadically thereby causing the deaths of the victims. He stated, “The attacks by the suspected Fulani militias have gone unabated without the government coming up with any concrete steps to bring the ugly incidences to end the unwanted killings and destruction of properties of the victims.” The state Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige, could not be reached for confirmation as he did not respond to calls put through to his phone.
