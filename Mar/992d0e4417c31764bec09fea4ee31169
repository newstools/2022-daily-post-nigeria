The police in Ogun State said it has arrested two men, Jato Abu Bello and Muhammad Suleiman, who allegedly kidnapped and collected N3 million ransom from a nursing mother, Salimot Ajibola in Abeokuta. DAILY POST earlier reported that the nursing mother, who was kidnapped at the entrance of her husband’s house around Rounder, Abeokuta, was freed after the payment of N3 million ransom. On Sunday, the police disclosed that the two men were arrested over “their roles in the series of kidnap cases in recent time.” The Ogun State police image maker, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said the suspects were nabbed in the early hours of Saturday. Their arrest, Oyeyemi said, followed an intelligence-based investigation embarked upon by the SP Taiwo Opadiran-led anti-kidnapping unit. The operatives had stormed the suspects’ hideout at the Rounder area of Abeokuta, in conjunction with men of Ilupeju and Lafenwa divisions to get them arrested. “The suspects have confessed being the gang that kidnapped one Ajibola Salimot Adejoke, who they traced and abducted in her house at Oke-Ode area, off Ayetoro road, Abeokuta on the 17th of February 2022,” Oyeyemi said. He added that the duo also said that their gang kidnapped the two siblings, Esther and David Kehinde at Ayetoro on Tuesday. According to the police spokesman, some of the victims have identified the duo as their abductors. Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, CP Lanre Bankole, has directed that other members of the syndicate must be hunted.
