Former Governor Abdulaziz Yari of Zamfara State has declined comments on happenings in the political sphere, saying the time is not ripe for such discussion. He said this while speaking with journalists who paid him a courtesy visit at his country home in Talata-Mafara town in the Talata-Mafara Local Government Area of the state on Saturday. Yari, however, dismissed insinuations that he is afraid of speaking to the press on political issues, saying he would surely make his thoughts known when the time is right. According to him, he was at his country home to have some discussion with his political associates. He commended the journalists, saying that the correspondents chapel of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) state council and his government enjoyed mutual understanding while he was governor. “I am a grassroots politician and not Abuja or Kaduna based politician. I always come to Zamfara State to do all my political activities because Zamfara state has always been my immediate constituency,” he said. He advised newsmen to always crosscheck their reports before going to avoid embarrassment or disseminating fake news.
