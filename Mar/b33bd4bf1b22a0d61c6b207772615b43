Watford manager, Roy Hodgson, has revealed that William Troost-Ekong will be out of action for up to four weeks. The captain of the Nigerian national team has sustained a muscle strain. Hodgson provided this update while speaking to the media on Friday. According to him, Troost-Ekong could be out for “the foreseeable future”, effectively ruling him out of the 2022 World Cup playoff against Ghana. “It’s a muscle strain for Sarr, the same with Troost-Ekong. “It’s going to keep them both out of the equation for the foreseeable future, but I don’t know how long exactly. “It’s not a minor thing, it’s not a knock, both have muscle strains, and that can take anything from a week to four weeks to recover from,” the 74-year-old manager said.
