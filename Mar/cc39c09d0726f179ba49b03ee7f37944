Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has berated President Muhammadu Buhari, who doubles as the Minister of Petroleum Resources, for allowing the current fuel scarcity to persist in the country. The group said that Buhari, being the minister, has permitted the pains and suffering of Nigerians due to the “unwarranted” scarcity which has lingered for over two weeks. In a media statement signed by Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko, the group National Coordinator, and Zainab Yusuf the National Media Publicity Affairs Director, HURIWA said that Buhari has taken the patience of millions of Nigerians for granted. The group pointed out that Buhari has allowed “wicked and lawless major petroleum dealers to sabotage the citizens by persistently hoarding petroleum products and openly selling only to thugs and street urchins at night who then return to the streets to sell the same petrol at over N500 per litre.” HURIWA lamented that the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) did not follow through with its promise to check and stop the disturbing petrol scarcity and has now been overwhelmed by the antics of shylock major fuel distributors. “…The mafia who do not want Nigerians to seamlessly buy petrol for their domestic and commercial uses have since overwhelmed the NNPC and right now for over a week, the scarcity of petroleum has become unbearable. “It would seem that President Buhari has taken the patience of the people for granted,” it said. The human rights advocacy group further warned that the masses’ suffering will get to the limits they could no longer endure and it could lead to street protests and riots which may be justifiable under these circumstances.
