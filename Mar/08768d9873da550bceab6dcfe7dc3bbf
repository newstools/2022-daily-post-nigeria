Nigeria interim coach, Augustine Eguavoen, has said Samuel Chukwueze and Innocent Bonke are big doubts for their crucial 2022 World Cup playoffs against Ghana on Tuesday. Eguavoen revealed this during the pre-match press conference on Monday. Chukwueze and Bonke were both substituted during Friday’s first leg clash which ended goalless. Both players are however not training with the rest of the squad ahead of the reverse fixture. “Chukwueze and Bonke are under observation the result hasn’t come. Bonke is not participating in training this evening as well because he had a knock he overstretched himself in Kumasi you know he worked very hard in Kumasi and did so well. “The medical team is still working on them it’s 24 hours before the game we are not going to risk anything. I’m expecting a report from medical team once they get that to me at 9pm tonight we will know if they will be in the pitch or not. But we have enough personnels in the team that can do the job,” Eguavoen said. —
