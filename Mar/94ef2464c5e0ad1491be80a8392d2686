Tottenham Hotspur manager, Antonio Conte, has hailed Cristiano Ronaldo’s appetite for big names after their 3-2 defeat to Manchester United on Saturday. Ronaldo netted a record-breaking hat-trick as United saw off Spurs at Old Trafford. The result boosted Ralf Rangnick’s men’s chances of finishing in the top four, while Conte’s men remained in seventh place. “It was an amazing performance. Unfortunately, I know him very well. We are talking about a player who, along with [Lionel] Messi, is the best of this era. He is decisive and in the moments when the team needs him, he is always present. “I remember also in the Champions League group for Manchester United, he was decisive. He is a player who feels this type of game. “When he feels the blood, he becomes Cristiano Ronaldo. A fantastic player, I repeat,” Conte said.
