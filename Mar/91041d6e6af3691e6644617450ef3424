The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has impounded 1,700 litres of suspected adulterated Automotive Gas Oil (AGO) and arrested 14 suspects in Akwa Ibom. The state Commandant of NSCDC, Mr Abidemi Majekodunmi, disclosed this on Tuesday while briefing journalists at the command’s exhibits yard in Uyo, the state capital. Majekodunmi said the 14 suspects were arrested on March 10 and 14 within Itu and Onna local government areas of the state. “NSCDC Akwa Ibom Command is here because of the arrest we have made. In our custody we have 14 suspects and we also have as exhibits four trucks laden with suspected petroleum products. “In total capacity we have 1,700 litres of AGO inside the trucks. They were accosted in four different locations. Three of them fall within Itu LGA while the fourth one was arrested in Onna LGA of Akwa Ibom State. “Definitely, we are suspicious of the content of the trucks. From our preliminary investigation we are suspected that this is adulterated petroleum products. We are working on the suspicion that it may be stolen products.” Majekodunmi said. While noting that the action was a contravention of the Nigerian Constitution, Majekodunmi said the command has inaugurated “operation flush” to flush criminals out of the state. He said, “The Nigerian economy has a strong presence in the oil industry. We must protect this industry because it is a strong national asset and that is one of the advantages that we have as a nation.”
