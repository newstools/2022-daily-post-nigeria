Former Chelsea defender, Tal Ben Haim, was involved in his old club’s sale as Friday’s deadline closed. TalkSPORT reports that Ben Haim was involved in brokering a deal for a Gulf-based billionaire to buy Chelsea. As the deadline to submit a bid to buy Chelsea closed on Friday night, following the UK government’s decision to sanction owner Roman Abramovich due to his links with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the West London club have yet another offer on the table involving Ben Haim. Ben Haim is helping a billionaire who has submitted a £2 billion offer and promised a further £500 million in funds in an effort to pip the likes of Nick Candy, Sebastian Coe and a three-man consortium to win the race. Bidders had until 9 pm on Friday to submit an offer, with the UK government effectively in control of Chelsea, who are operating under a special license to continue with certain aspects of their business for the meantime. Abramovich had put Chelsea up for sale prior to the UK government sanctions amid Russia’s continued invasion of Ukraine. The 55-year-old had bought Chelsea in 2003 for £140 million before leading them to the top of European football.
