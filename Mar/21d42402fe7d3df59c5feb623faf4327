The leadership of Ekiti State Youth Parliament has called on the Governor of the state, John Kayode Fayemi, to expedite action in ensuring that justice is served to the family of Oluwabamise Ayanwola, a young lady, who went missing and found dead after boarding a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), on Tuesday, in Lagos State. According to the Speaker of the Parliament, Rt. Hon. Toba Fatunla, the leadership of the parliament met on Wednesday, in Ado-Ekiti, in an emergency session to press home their demands, saying that Bamise, an indigene of Ekiti, deserves justice and called on the governor to use his office to intervene in the matter. He said, “The news of the death of Bamise, an Ekiti born, precisely Moba Local Government Area indigene in a BRT of death in Lagos is most unfortunate and disheartening, it shows how our society has degraded and the country becoming increasingly unsafe for the youth. “We call on the Governor of Ekiti and Her Excellency, Erelu Bisi Fayemi to intervene and not allow this incident swept under the carpet. The life of every Ekiti youth anywhere matters and we cannot, therefore, keep quiet while one of us is killed mysteriously.” They went further to appeal to the governor to prioritise the welfare of Ekiti Youth, engage them more and enhance their capacity before the expiration of his tenure.
