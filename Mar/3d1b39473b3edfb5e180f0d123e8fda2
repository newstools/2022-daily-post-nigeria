Paris Saint-Germain manager, Mauricio Pochettino has criticized the referee for allowing Karim Benzema’s equalizer stand, following their 3-1 defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League on Wednesday night. Pochettino feels Benzema fouled goalkeeper, Gianluigi Donnarumma before scoring the goal that began Los Blancos’ comeback. “It’s a feeling of a lot of injustice, with the goal we conceded. “It’s a clear foul from Benzema on Donnarumma. It’s a tremendous blow, because we were better in the tie,” Pochettino said. He added: “I’ve seen the images from every angle. It was not a mistake from the goalkeeper. It’s a foul. “Little details count, and VAR didn’t see a clear foul. It’s decisive.” Benzema went on to score two more goals, as Real Madrid progressed into the quarter-finals on a 3-2 aggregate.
