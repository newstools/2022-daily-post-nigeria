The Senate Minority leader and 2023 the Abia governorship aspirant, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe has reacted to the document being circulated in the State, which purported to have zoned Abia State 2023 governorship to the North and Central Senatorial districts. In a statement he issued on Sunday, Abaribe urged the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, supporters in Abia State to disregard the document, stating that it speaks of imposition of candidate. He said there must be an end to imposition of candidates in Abia State, as party supporters and the electorate have rights to elect anybody of their choice and also be voted for. The statement said: “My attention has been drawn to a document signed by the State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Dr Alwell Asiforo purporting that the Abia State PDP has zoned the governorship seat to Abia North and Abia Central and wish to assure all Abians who are desirous of an end to imposition in Abia State to disregard the purported zoning. “While any member of PDP has the right to support anybody for any elective position in Nigeria, it cannot be to the exclusion of any other member.” Abaribe claimed that the document was issued to exclude him from the gubernatorial race, a development, he said was unconstitutional. “By virtue of section 42(2) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended, no person or body can exclude Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe from contesting and winning the 2023 elections in Abia State,” he said. The lawmaker called on the citizens to make themselves available for the forthcoming congresses and party primaries so that not only their voice would be heard, but they will determine who governs them.
