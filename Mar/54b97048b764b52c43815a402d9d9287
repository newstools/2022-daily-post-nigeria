According to her, her generator has been running since Tuesday morning despite the high cost of diesel. Her tweet read, “800 naira per litre of diesel, my generator has been on since yesterday morning, Nigeria..which way to go o?” Davido on the other hand asked for prayers for Nigeria as he complained about the amount he paid to clear his Lamborghini. Davido tweeted: “You don’t even want to know how much I just paid to clear my lambo. Pray for Nigeria, Jesus.” Recently, many parts of the country have been thrown in total darkness after the collapse of the national grid. Although the Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu assured of a solution to the epileptic supply across the nation, the high cost of diesel and petrol has worsened the plights of Nigerians.
