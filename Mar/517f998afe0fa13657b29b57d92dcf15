United States President, Joe Biden, has hit out at Russian President Vladimir Putin amid the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Biden said Putin has failed to divide NATO allies in their reaction to his invasion of Ukraine. He said NATO has learned from sad experiences in two world wars and all stayed together as Russia continued to invade Ukraine. Recall that Putin had last month ordered the invasion of Ukraine over disagreements on some political issues. Speaking during a trip to the Polish capital Warsaw, Biden said as quoted by the BBC: “I am confident that Vladimir Putin was counting on being able to divide Nato, being able to separate the eastern flank from the west, and being able to separate nations based on past histories. “But he has not been able to do it – we have all stayed together. “I just think it’s so important that we, Poland and the United States, keep in lockstep how we are proceeding.” “We have learned from a sad experience in two world wars, when we have stayed out and not been involved in instability in Europe, it always comes back to haunt us in the United States,” he added.
