A former member of the House of Representatives, Abdulmumin Jibrin has tackled critics of the National Leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC Bola Tinubu over a trending video showing his hands shaking. Jibrin who represented the Kiru/Bebeji Federal Constituency of Kano State at the previous assembly, said Tinubu, a 2023 presidential candidate remains their choice despite his alleged health issues. He urged those criticizing the former Lagos State Governor to mobilize their own presidential candidate and leave Tinubu alone. DAILY POST reports that since the APC leader declared intention to run for the office of president, several video clips have emerged on social media revealing his alleged poor health. Asiwaju’s critics have urged him to dash the dream of becoming Nigeria’s President and focus on his health to pave way for younger people to take over leadership of the country. However, Jibrin, in a tweet on his official Twitter handle on Tuesday, described the criticism as an attack, saying they are prepared for it. He said, “Let his hands be shaking, he remains our choice. You cannot suffocate our democratic space. “Go and mobilise support for your aspirants whose hands are not shaking. Aren’t you the majority? let’s meet at the ballot. We are resolute and our support is total. Where Asiwaju goes, we go! “We must be prepared for more and more unfair and senseless attacks. It is not a criticism but enmity. There will always be that small group spreading hate. “As with several presidents, some of these attacks will continue through the various elections and Tinubu’s tenure as president”.
