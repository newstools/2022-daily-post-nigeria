Argentina captain, Lionel Messi, on Friday set a new record after scoring a goal in his side’s 2022 FIFA World Cup playoff against Venezuela. The Paris Saint-Germain forward was on target in Argentina’s 3-0 win over Venezuela in his first appearance for the Albiceleste since November last year. Messi’s goal against Venezuela was his seventh strike of the campaign, with only Bolivia’s Marcel Moreno (10) and Brazil’s Neymar (8) scoring more than him. Overall, Messi now has 28 goals in FIFA World Cup qualifiers, which is the joint-most in CONMEBOL history, alongside his former Barcelona teammate, Luis Suarez. The seven-time Ballon d’ Or winner is ahead of Bolivia’s Marcelo Martins (22), Chile’s Alexis Sanchez (19) and Argentine legend, Hernan Crespo (19) comprise the top five. Meanwhile, Argentina have already booked their place in the FIFA World Cup in Qatar. The Copa America champions still have a playoff against Ecuador and Messi has the chance to bag a few more and take the outright lead in CONMEBOL FIFA World Cup qualifiers.
