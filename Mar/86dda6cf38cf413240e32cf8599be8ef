The Benin Zonal Command of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) says it rescued 105 victims of human trafficking in various operations in 2021. Mr Nduka Nwannwenne, the Zonal Commander, NAPTIP, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday that some of the rescued victims have already been reunited with their families, while some have been empowered with skills to engage in businesses. He said that Director-General, NAPTIP, Dr Fatima Waziri-Azi, was focused on ensuring that all rescued victims were empowered to ensure self-reliance. The zonal commander said that 134 cases of human trafficking were received by the command in the period under review. Nwannwenne said that 75 suspected traffickers were arrested, while three human traffickers were convicted by law courts during the period, adding however, that 65 cases were still pending in law courts. He said that the blue bus campaign concept aimed at raising awareness on the dangers of human trafficking has been effective in the zone. “The blue bus concept is a one stop shop for issues of human trafficking. “With the blue bus initiative which is been done with the International Organisation on Migration (IOM), there has been increased in reported cases of human trafficking,” he said.
