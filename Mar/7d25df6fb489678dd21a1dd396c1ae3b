The Hijrah Council of Nigeria, on Monday, called on all Muslim female police officers across the country not to feel intimidated to wear hijab on their uniforms as recently approved by the Force. Recall that the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba had on March 4, 2022, unveiled a new dress code for female Muslim police officers, permitting them to use hijab, saying the move was in line with international best practices. The development had triggered reactions from concerned Nigerians, as some Muslims applauded the IGP, while many Christians believed it was a move to Islamize the Nigeria police. Reacting, a statement issued and made available to journalists on Monday by the Amir of the Council, Prof. Lanre Badmus Yusuf, the Hijab Council hailed the IGP, saying he is living up to global standard. He said, “as Muslim women working in the police, you should not shy away, feel intimidated or inferior in the utilization of hijab while in uniforms.” “The development means the IGP is living up to the global standard and gallantly putting Nigeria on the world map of countries that understand and recognize the fundamental human right of Muslim women”, he added.
