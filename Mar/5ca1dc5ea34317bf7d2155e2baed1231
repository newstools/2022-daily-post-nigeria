There was pandemonium in Swali community in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital, following the setting ablaze of a suspected cultist by a rival cult group. The incident reportedly took place around the popular Swali ultra modern market at the early hours of Saturday, in what appears to be a reprisal attack. The victim, whose residence was discovered shredded and burnt to ashes, was simply identified as Christopher Samuel. But DAILY POST gathered from traders in the market that the victim was a suspected criminal who was a leader of a robbery gang that have been terrorising traders in the area. According to sources, he led a four man robbery gang to rob Swali community, when they were engaged in a gun duel, and that in the process of escaping, the victim ran into an angry mob that set him on fire before the police arrived at the scene. While in a statement issued to DAILY POST through the state’s Police Public Relations Officer, SP Asinim Butswat, confirmed the incident but said the victim was a suspected cultist. The statement reads, “On 26 March 2022, at about 0630 hours Policemen responded to a distress call of cult related clashes at Sand Road Swali, Yenagoa. On arrival the patrol team discovered a charred body of a suspected cultist. “Preliminary investigation reveals that the charred body was one Christopher Samuel ‘m’ 21 years, a notorious member of Bobos cult group, who was macheted and set ablaze by a rival cult group. “The corpse was evacuated and deposited at the Niger Delta University Teaching Hospital, Okolobiri for autopsy. “Investigation is ongoing to identify and arrest the perpetrators of the dastardly act.”
