Former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, has hailed ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo who clocks 85 on Saturday. The Wazirin Adamawa described the retired General as a leader committed to good governance in Nigeria and Africa. In a statement on Friday, Abubakar said the celebration of Obasanjo was parallel to celebrating the vision of good leadership and pan-Africanism. The former VP noted that the celebrant continues to put forward progressive ideals in governments across the continent. Recalling the late 70s when Africa was under military dictatorships, Obasanjo set the pace for a transfer of power to civilian government in Nigeria. That singular effort, according to him, began the process of democratisation across the continent. “Similarly when he assumed office in 1999 as a civilian president, Chief Obasanjo re-enacted a convention in Africa which makes the people as the centerpiece of government policies. “Obasanjo created an era of progressive reforms in Nigeria that continues to benefit the people of Nigeria up till today.” Atiku said these were the reasons he continued to enjoy the goodwill of progressive politicians and statesmen, not just in Africa but globally.
