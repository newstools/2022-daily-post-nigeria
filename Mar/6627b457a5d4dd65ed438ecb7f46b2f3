An Ibadan-based Islamic cleric, Mallam Ali Temitope Abdussalam, has advised parents to give their children proper training before they become adults. Abdussalam, who is the Director of Ali Institute for Qur’an memorisation, Ibadan, noted that failure to give children proper home and spiritual training they need at a tender age may lead to regret when they grow up to be adults. Abdussalam made these disclosures on Sunday in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, during the graduation of his students. He said that in this period where social vices are common among the youths, there is a need for parents to give children the moral upbringing and teachings they need to prepare for the future, adding that society is getting more corrupt on a daily basis. He said that the only way to get out of this mess is for the parents to equip their children properly at a tender age so that they can be better citizens when they grow old.  “Always remember that failure to give them the spiritual diet they need today will lead to regret tomorrow regardless of their level of western education. “There is no doubt in the fact that society is getting more corrupt by the day as what our children are exposed to ranging from music to movies and negative exposures on the social media are most destructive to their moral and spiritual senses. “We are all witnesses to the aftermath effect of these tools being deployed by shaytan. “Unfortunately, parents that are expected to explain to these innocent children the evils in our society, their effects and how to avoid them are busy seeking daily livelihood and not having enough time to guide these children,” he said.
