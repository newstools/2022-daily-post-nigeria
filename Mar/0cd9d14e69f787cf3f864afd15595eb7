Russian Ambassador to the United Nations, Vassily Nebenzia, on Tuesday, said that Russia will honour a ceasefire in Ukraine if his country’s demands, including demilitarization and denazification are fulfilled. Nebenzia’s comments come as Russian forces continue to pummel the Ukrainian countryside and advance on the capital city of Kyiv. “The ceasefire will take place when conditions that were put forward by Russia are implemented and they are very well-known,” Nebenzia told reporters. “Demilitarization of Ukraine, denazification of Ukraine, no threat which would come from that territory, that country to Russia, no joining NATO … The goal of Ukraine joining NATO is in the Ukrainian constitution, so it should be dropped from there first and foremost,” he added. Meanwhile, President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday said Ukraine has accepted that it will not become a member of NATO. Recall that the war between Ukraine and Russia began last month. The war enters its nineteenth day today, with massive casualties already recorded. Russian President, Vladimir Putin, had ordered the invasion of Ukraine over disagreements on some political issues. Putin had also listed some conditions to end the war.
