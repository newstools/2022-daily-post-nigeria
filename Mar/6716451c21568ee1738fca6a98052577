Nigeria’s Minister of Youth and Sports, Sunday Dare, has revealed his conversation with President Muhammadu Buhari ahead of the Super Eagles’ 2022 FIFA World Cup playoff against the Black Stars of Ghana on Friday. DAILY POST reports that Nigeria and Ghana will clash on Friday at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi. The Super Eagles will then host Ghana in the return leg on Tuesday at the Moshood Abiola National (MKO) Stadium in Abuja. However, according to Dare, Buhari may likely be present at the MKO Abiola stadium for the second leg tie. He said he met Buhari in Lagos as the President asked him why he was not in Ghana for the Super Eagles’ tie with the Black Stars. Dare disclosed this on NFF TV, while addressing the coaching crew of the Super Eagles inside the main bowl of the stadium on Wednesday morning. According to Dare, it is not 100 percent guaranteed that the President will attend the second leg, but he is likely going to be present. He said: “I was in Lagos yesterday (Tuesday) and the President [Muhammadu Buhari] asked me why I was not in Ghana and I realized that the President also knows that there is a Ghana match. “He has not given me 100 percent assurance, but he is likely going to show up here (second leg) on the 29th as a surprise.” He added, “So I wish you the best, all I can do is pray and support you. I had to give you a good pitch here. I am glad they (players) liked it.”
