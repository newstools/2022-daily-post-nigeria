Ghana may move the first leg of their 2022 World Cup playoff against Nigeria to a neutral venue, Complete Sports reports. This is due to the bad state of the Cape Coast Stadium which was initially approved for the game. There have been doubts about the pitch in Cape Coast after it hosted the country’s 65th Independence Day parade. Although renovation works have begun on the field, it seems there might not be enough time to finish it before the clash. The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) filed a petition to the Confederation of African Football (CAF) on the bad state of the pitch last week and a CAF/FIFA inspection delegation is now in Ghana this week to follow up on this. CAF had earlier turned down a request from Ghana for the match to be moved to the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi. The match may be moved to a neutral venue with Benin and Morocco suitable options.
