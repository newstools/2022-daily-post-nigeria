Real Madrid boss, Carlo Ancelotti says he has already told his players that he was to blame for their 4-0 thrashing in the hands of Barcelona on Sunday. The Italian said it was his mistakes that cost Real Madrid their 4-0 loss against Barcelona in El Clasico played at the Santiago Bernabeu. Although Real Madrid maintained a 12-point gap over Barcelona after the defeat, Ancelotti was not happy with himself after the game. “We were not recognisable, everything went wrong. I told the players that [the defeat] was my fault,” Ancelotti said during his post-match interview. “We played very badly and we approached the game very badly. “We have time to gather our energy and prepare for the last two months of the season to win trophies. “I’m very sad about the defeat, I’m sorry for the fans, but I have to be calm,” he added.
