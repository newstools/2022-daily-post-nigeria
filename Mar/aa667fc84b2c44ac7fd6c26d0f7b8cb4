An electoral observer body, Yiaga Africa, has reiterated its determination in building citizens’ confidence in the electoral process. Yiaga Board member, Mr Ezenwa Nwagwu gave the assurance at a one-day Media Roundabout held in Ado-Ekiti, for journalists in Ekiti State. The event which is towards the 2022 Ekiti gubernatorial election drew journalists from both the print and electronic media. Mr Nwagwu said there is a need to consolidate democracy, and that cannot be attained in isolation of the media, whose watchdog role in society remains fundamental. He urged journalists to report accurately, objectively and fairly, the electoral process no matter whose ox is gored. “Our mandate is to provide accurate and timely information in the electoral process. We ensure that votes count by detecting and preventing fraud. We want to build citizens’ confidence in the electoral process.” He said Yiaga Africa in the execution of its mandate does not sweep any electoral infraction under the carpet. “We are to detect fraud and other malpractices in the electoral process. We don’t cover such rather we tell the whole world. Nwagwu posited that the group is partnering with key electoral stakeholders such as INEC, media, civil society organizations, political parties, security agencies among others to prepare them for the forthcoming Ekiti governorship election scheduled for June 18, 2022.
