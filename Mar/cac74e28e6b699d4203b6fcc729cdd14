A serial fraudster, Mohammed Sani Zubair, has been sentenced to two years imprisonment. Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of the Federal High Court sitting in Maitama, Abuja, convicted and sentenced him. Zubair was first arraigned on October 8, 2018, on a four-count charge bordering on fraudulent dealings. He and accomplices “that specialized in defrauding people”, scammed retired Major General Geoffrey Ejiga to the tune of N180,000,000. The children petitioned the EFCC, informing them that a syndicate took advantage of their father’s old age. EFCC, in one of the counts, said Zubair made a written statement to Naziru Aminu Shehu, an operative, on October 28, 2016 “which you knew to be false”. His offence is punishable under Section 39 (2) (a) and (b) of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (Establishment) Act, 2004. After Zubair pleaded “not guilty”, prosecution counsel, Richards Dauda prayed for an accelerated hearing. Defence counsel, O. F. Ekengba did not object. Justice Ojukwu however gave the convict an option of a fine of N400,000. The anti-graft agency disclosed that it found out that Zubair was involved in several other fraudulent activities.
