The National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) in Lagos is still selling tickets at motor parks and garages. This is despite the suspension of all activities by the national body and Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu-led government. In a statement on Monday, the suspended NURTW Chairman, Musiliu Akinsanya alias MC Oluomo told union members to continue operations. “This is to formally inform all NURTW Chairmen and entire members to operate your day to day union activities at the various motor parks & garages. “Disregard any patrol policemen parading themselves to disrupt your union operations.” The notice advised that any disruption of activities by police be reported to the leadership “for rectification”. Hours after the circular went public, Oluomo issued an update denying that he authorized the sale of NURTW tickets. The embattled chairman clarified that the ones being sold belong to the Lagos government. “I am a law-abiding citizen. I have never authorised the sale of union tickets”, he noted. “Lagos State tickets issued (are) being sold at all the parks and garages. I cannot stop the sales of government tickets. I don’t even have such powers.”
