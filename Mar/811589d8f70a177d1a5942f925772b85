A Federal High Court in Abuja on Thursday discharged and acquitted a former Group Managing Director, GMD, Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, Andrew Yakubu from the $9.8 million corruption charges brought against him by the Federal Government. Justice Ahmed Ramat Mohammed in a judgment ordered the huge foreign exchange seized from him in 2017 and kept at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) be refunded to him forthwith. The Judge held that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), which put Yakubu on trial, failed woefully to establish that he held the money over and above the threshold allowed by law. Justice Mohammed further said that the evidence of the witnesses of the anti-graft agency created gap of doubts which must be resolved in favour of the defendant. Details later.
