Former Arsenal striker, Kevin Campbell has suggested that Premier League clubs will battle to sign Rangers midfielder, Joe Aribo, in the upcoming summer transfer window. Campbell also urged Rangers to ensure they get top dollars for the Super Eagles star amid interest from Premier League clubs. Aribo has been attracting interest from several clubs in the Premier League, including Crystal Palace, Watford, Southampton and Aston Villa. The 25-year-old joined Rangers from Charlton Athletic in the summer of 2019. Aribo will enter the final twelve months of his contract with the Scottish Premiership champions in July. It is all but confirmed that Aribo would end his association with Rangers in the summer whether or not the club earns a qualifying spot in the group stage of the Champions League. “There comes a time where they (Aribo and Kent) will consider their futures,” Campbell told Football Insider. “A lot of clubs will have been watching their progress. They are performing really well so clubs will be wanting them to come in the summer, clubs with big money.” Campbell added: “Unfortunately, Premier League teams are gonna come knocking for Aribo and Kent. “What is important for Rangers is that they get top dollar for them. That way they can restock the shelves in the summer.”
