The Northern Elders Forum, NEF, has predicted that former members of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, will soon control the All Progressives Congress, APC. Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, the spokesman of NEF, said the upcoming APC National Convention would see some former PDP members controlling the APC. In a series of tweets, Baba-Ahmed said the PDP would also have some APC stalwarts in its leadership in the future. According to Baba-Ahmed: “By the time APC concludes the selection of its new leaders in a few days, you are likely to see the vast majority of former PDP members in control of APC. “PDP’s new leaders will also have a heavy presence of former APC stalwarts in charge of its future. Do the math. What will be new?” He also stressed that some smaller political parties would be controlled by a lot of former PDP and APC chieftains. “There will be many former PDP/APC big wigs in charge of smaller parties as well. People who see parties only as election platforms are unlikely to move to small parties just to make up the numbers. They will move there to take over and realize personal ambitions. What will change?” He further stated.
