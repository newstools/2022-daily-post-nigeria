The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Kaduna State Council, on Monday, commended security operatives for dislodging bandits at the Kaduna International Airport. DAILY POST recalls that last week, over 200 bandits laid siege at the Kaduna International Airport, preventing an aircraft from taking off and killing a security man in the process. In a statement on Monday, in Kaduna, the state Chairperson, Ayuba Magaji Suleiman, who described the siege on the airport as an assault on Nigeria, lamented that in spite of the heavy presence of the military in the Igabi Area, the bandits were able to breach protocol. According to the statement, “we gathered the hoodlums even prevented flight schedules. This action ridicules Nigeria and must not be allowed to occur ever again.” The statement appealed to security agents to put more effort in protecting lives and property. The statement, while commiserating with the staff of the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) who was shot dead by the invading terrorists, urged the general public to always report suspicious movement or persons to relevant security agencies to ensure prompt action and prevention of attacks by enemies of peace.
