Nigerian Singer, Banky W has reacted to the reopening of the Lekki-Ikoyi bridge toll collection in April. Recall that the Lekki-Ikoyi Toll Plaza and the one inward Lekki stopped operations in October 2020, during the EndSARS protest. However, the Lekki Concession Company Limited (LCC) in a statement on Monday announced that although operations would begin on April 1st, fees would not be collected until April 15th. Reacting, Banky W in a tweet on Friday said the decision shows a lack of empathy by the Lagos State Government. According to him, the timing of the decision was unfair. He wrote, ”The intended resumption of collections at the Lekki toll gate is yet another example of a serious lack of empathy by the Lagos State Govt. Life in Nigeria has been extremely difficult. ”Lagos State is exhibiting a blatant disregard – not just for the pain felt by all the young people who were hurt by the events of #EndSARS, but also the pain and difficulty being experienced by the majority of Lagosians just trying to survive in these difficult times.”
