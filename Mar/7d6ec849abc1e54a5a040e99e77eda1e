Simon Ekpa, a self-styled disciple of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB has predicted that the embattled DCP Abba Kyari may not return to Nigeria if extradited to the United States. Recall that the Federal Government on Thursday, approved the extradition of Kyari after the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI indicted him on alleged ties with an internet fraudster, Hushpuppi. Reacting, Ekpa, a Finnish who constantly raised alarm over Kyari’s activities in the Southeast prior to his arrest, said Americans will finish him when he finally lands in their prison. He said this in a recent tweet on his official Twitter handle on Thursday. He said, “One of the Fulani most notorious Jihadists in Nig police that were used to advance jihad in Biafraland called Abba Kyari will finally land in US prison and in California for that matter where they will finish him. “Any lover of freedom in that prison must know that he is a jihadist”.
