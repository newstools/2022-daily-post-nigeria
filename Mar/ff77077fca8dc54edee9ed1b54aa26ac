His Holiness, Pope Francis will hold an extraordinary prayer called a “consecration” for Russia and Ukraine next week, amid the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia, the Vatican announced in a statement on Tuesday. Pope Francis will carry out the consecration in St. Peter’s Basilica. Recall that the war between Ukraine and Russia started last month and many casualties have already been recorded. The prayer Pope Francis will perform is unique because it’s connected to a “belief in a 1917 prophecy of the Virgin Mary in Fatima,” in which it’s claimed she said that the consecration of Russia would usher in a period of world peace. “Russia will spread her errors throughout the world, causing wars and persecutions of the Church. The good will be martyred; the Holy Father will have much to suffer; various nations will be annihilated,” the prophecy reads. This special request of the Virgin Mary is called the ‘Third Secret of Fatima’, for the name of the town in Portugal where she is said to have appeared to three children in 1917.
