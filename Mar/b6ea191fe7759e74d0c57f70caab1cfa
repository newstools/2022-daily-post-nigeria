Former Arsenal captain, Thierry Henry, has called for patience with Lionel Messi as he looks to recapture his best form at Paris Saint-Germain. Henry claims Messi “left Barcelona crying” and suffered an “emotional shock” before arriving in France. The seven-time Ballon d’Or winner left the Nou Camp in the summer of 2021 as a free agent. However, Messi has found it tough in Ligue 1. But Henry, who spent three years alongside the 34-year-old at Barca between 2007 and 2010, told L’Equipe: “You’d have to ask him, I can’t speak for him. But, when we tal about Messi or Neymar, who are exceptional players, we too often forget that aspect. “When Lionel cried on leaving Barcelona, that wasn’t part of the plan. When you think you’re never going to leave somewhere, and then suddenly it happens, it creates an emotional shock. “People say, ‘he’s fine, he’s got everything he needs in Paris’, but it’s not that simple. “When I left Arsenal for Barcelona it took me a year to feel good. I arrived there with an injury, going through a divorce, I have to learn a new system, you mix all of that up and it plays on the mind.”
