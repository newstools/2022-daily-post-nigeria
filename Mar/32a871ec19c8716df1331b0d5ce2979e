Barcelona manager, Xavi Hernandez has said he did not expect his side to beat Real Madrid 4-0 at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday. A brace from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and one goal apiece from Ronald Araujo and Ferran Torres ensured that Barcelona thrashed Real Madrid in front of their home fans. Xavi compared the win to the last time Barcelona thrashed Real Madrid at the Bernabeu, being a 6-2 win achieved during Pep Guardiola’s time in charge of the Catalan side in 2009. “We have worked hard for these results. But we didn’t expect to be so superior in their stadium,” Xavi said in his post-match interview. “We expected a more open game. I am very happy.” He continued, “It can be compared. We were far superior, in terms of goals and our play. We leave with a smile from ear to ear. “First [we’ll focus on staying in] the Champions League places and then we’ll see. This [win] strengthens the project. We haven’t achieved our objectives yet. We have to keep going,” he stated.
