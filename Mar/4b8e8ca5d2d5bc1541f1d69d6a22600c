The Yoruba socio-political organization, Afenifere, has reacted to the release of Sunday Igboho. Afenifere’s National Publicity Secretary, Jared Ajayi, described Igboho’s release as a victory for self-determination. He noted that the socio-political body and people of the Southwest are happy over the agitator’s release. “Sunday Adeyemo Igboho’s release is not just for him and the Yoruba people, it is a victory indicator for all those who believe in personal liberty and the right of a given people to self-determination,” he told Vanguard on Monday in Lagos. Igboho regained freedom on Monday in Cotonou, Benin Republic. The pioneer of Oduduwa Republic was released by the Government of Republic of Benin on Monday on health grounds. The development was disclosed in a statement issued by the umbrella body of Yoruba Self-determination Groups, Ilana Omo Oodua Worldwide. The spokesman said the Government of Benin Republic handed over Igboho IOO leader, Prof. Banji Akintoye.
