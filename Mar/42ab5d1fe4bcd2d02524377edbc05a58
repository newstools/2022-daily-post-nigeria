Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) Comptroller General, Isah Jere has reacted to the Nigerian High Commission circular announcing the suspension of e-Passports issuance in the United Kingdom. Many citizens, including those that had to travel long distances from Scotland, Northern Ireland, Manchester, Cardiff, Birmingham and others, have decried the situation. In a statement Monday night, NIS Public Relations Officer, Amos Okpu announced that CG Jere has ordered continuation of the document. The spokesman said as part of efforts to deepen government’s data harmonization policy and seamless integrated identity management, the e-Passport facility was opened in London last November. He listed the requirements as digitized application and payment process as well as registration with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC). “Applicants get to apply and pay the exact fee only for the Passport category of their choice online via passport.immigration.gov.ng while the appointment system is aimed at reducing the avoidable age-long overcrowding”, Okpu noted. The official said the claim in the circular that the enhanced e-Passport and the appointment system brought some challenges “is at best an imagination”. The NIS said since November, a total of 5918 Passport applications have been received and processed, out of which 5225 have been produced. Appealing to Nigerians in the UK for calm, Okpu informed the CG has “directed the Immigration Attaches at the Mission to continue with the issuance of the enhanced e-Passports”. A team led by the Assistant Comptroller General of Immigration overseeing the Passport Directorate will fly to London this week to address all challenges. Jere assured members of the public of management’s commitment to deploy ICT solutions “to eliminate all unnecessary bottlenecks with a view to maintaining quality and transparent service”.
