The winner of last month’s Akpabuyo state constituency by-election organised by INEC, Dr. Ekeng Edet was today sworn-in by the Cross River State House of Assembly. Speaker, Mr Eteng Williams administered the oath of office and allegiance on the floor of the assembly. The need arose for the byelection due to the demise of former occupant, Mrs Elizabeth Ironbar, who died in 2021. Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had declared Edet, a member of PDP, winner with 5,866 votes. His APC contender, Mr Bassey Effiom of the All Progressive Congress (APC) scored 5,363. Speaking to Journalists, Edet said: “I can assure you that I will give effective representation to my people in the Akpabuyo State Constituency. “It doesn’t matter whether APC or PDP dominates the house, what matters is that we are all representing Cross River and the state comes first.” APC dominates the assembly with 18 members out of 25 member-capacity.
