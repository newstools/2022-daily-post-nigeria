Super Eagles legend, Jay Jay Okocha, has described Bola Tinubu, an All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential aspirant, as leaders of all leaders. Okocha remarked that Tinubu is the reason he calls Lagos State home and why Lagosians are comfortable. The retired footballer disclosed this during a meeting of former Super Eagles players with Tinubu in Lagos on Saturday. DAILY POST had reported that the former Super Eagles met with Tinubu on Saturday at his home ahead of the novelty football match scheduled for Sunday at Onikan Stadium in Lagos State. Kanu Nwakwo, Okocha, Taribo West, and Victor Ikpeba were among the ex-internationals who visited the APC chieftain. The ex-players presence at Tinubu’s Lagos mansion on Saturday has since generated reactions online. Speaking during the meeting, Okocha said: “You are the reason I call Lagos home, you are the reason we are so comfortable in Lagos and for me you are the leaders of all leaders. “May the Almighty Lord continue to protect, guide, and meet you at the point of your needs; even though I don’t know if you still need something. “But, whatever your desire is, the Lord will grant it, especially in good health.” Video: https://fb.watch/bSWpnX4HUM/
