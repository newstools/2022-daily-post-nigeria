Lagos State Government has suspended Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) operations following the death of Bamise Ayanwola. The action was taken as a precaution after intelligence on “planned attacks” by persons yet to be identified. A memo was reportedly sent to BRT operators, through the Ministry of Transportation, notifying them that the government could not guarantee their protection for now. A joint team of military and police personnel are keeping watch at Ojota to forestall the anticipated demonstration. Today, being International Women’s Day, some activists and concerned Nigerians were said to have agreed to protest Bamise’s murder. The 22-year-old went missing after boarding a BRT bus from the Chevron area. She was later found with missing body parts. The victim worked as a Fashion Designer and mostly spent weekends at Ota in Ogun State with her sister, it was gathered. A Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa says the events surrounding Bamise’s death are intriguing. The lawyer wants the Federal Government and the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, to take over the investigation of the case.
