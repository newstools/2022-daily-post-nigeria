Governor Mai Buni of Yobe State and his Niger State counterpart, Sani Bello, have reconciled. This is just as the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) says it is working hard to ensure a successful nation convention. The event will be held on March 26 after postponements and accusations that the leadership was buying time to remain in office. President Muhammadu Buhari was forced to issue a statement banning further divisive actions and utterances. As part of peace efforts and reconciliation, Buni and Bello met Thursday night in Abuja, the Nigerian capital. At the Yobe Government Lodge, Buni applauded the CECPC members on the level of preparations towards the convention. “Since I travelled, the party has not stopped. His Excellency (Bello) has done very well in managing the affairs. “We are here to discuss the issues going forward. We are now at the finishing line in the preparations for our convention “We are putting heads together to achieve this task ahead. I want to emphasise that the March 26 (convection date) is sacrosanct.” Buni, however, clarified that the visit was not a formal meeting of the CECPC. “CECPC members just came to welcome me back to the country and wish me well after returning from a medical trip”, he clarified. In his remark, Bello said he had acted as party chairman and that we made lots of progress towards the convention. He mentioned the inauguration of State Chairmen, adoption of zoning formula for the convention and actions on some decisions CECPC took before Buni left Nigeria. “I can tell you for free that in the last one week, we have ensured that we are good to go for the national convention”, Bello added.
