Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti has revealed how his team will approach their Champions League round of 16 second-leg tie against Paris Saint-Germain, on Wednesday in Spain. Recall that PSG defeated Real Madrid 1-0 in the Champions League round of 16 first-leg in Paris last month. But speaking during his post-match conference on Saturday after Real Madrid’s LaLiga 4-1 victory against Real Sociedad, Ancelotti said the Los Blancos would approach their Champions League tie against the French Ligue 1 side by pressing from above. According to him, Real Madrid will play Mauricio Pochettino’s side as they did against Real Sociedad. The Italian said, “I think we played very well [against Real Sociedad]. The plan was this, press from above. The plan went well. We did very well. “Playing like this, we have a better chance of doing well on Wednesday.” He added, “All of Madrid believes more after this game. The idea of going out at the end of the game was born from the players because on Wednesday, the help of the fans is essential.”
