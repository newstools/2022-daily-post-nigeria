A human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, has officially joined the presidential race ahead of the 2023 general elections. The activist disclosed the development in a post on his verified Facebook page on Tuesday morning. According to SaharaReporters, Sowore is expected to contest on the platform of the African Action Congress (AAC). Recall that the activist, while accusing the President Muhammadu Buhari’s government of arresting and slamming fresh charges against him, stated that he would soon officially declare his presidential ambition. “They took me to their detention when they were tired; they came and call me that I should be going home. “So I’m heading home now, no reason to worry, we know why this is happening, they are afraid of the future, they are afraid Sowore will declare very soon and become the president of Nigeria; you can’t stop me”, he said in a post on his social media handle.
