The Igando Customary Court, Lagos State, has decried the high rate at which young couples divorce their marriages. The court President, Mr Koledoye Adeniyi, said this during the dissolution of the marriage between Mrs Olubunmi Adebanjo and Mr Balogun Adebanjo on grounds of abandonment and constant battery. In his ruling, he said, “it’s sad these days the rate at which young couples within a short period of their marriages run to court for a divorce. “It is necessary for a man and a woman to observe and study each other very well before getting married. “But more often than not, this does not happen and couples quickly get married as soon as they fall in love not caring whether the love is genuine or not, which is why they put up the excuse of being incompatible with each other and seek divorce.” Using the case as an example, the Judge noted that the union would have been saved if genuine love was there in the first place. NAN reports that Olubunmi, approached the court on Feb. 8, accusing her husband of abandoning her for two years. She also complained of incompatibility, lack of love and care and frequent beating. Olubunmi had told the court that her husband would pick up quarrels with her over trivial issues, and beat her at any slight provocation. Olubunmi told the court that he had taken to lying, smoking and drinking and moving around with women. The couple were married for five years. The respondent, Mr Balogun Adebanjo, when summoned by the court on phone said he was not interested in the marriage. He also told the court to go ahead and do what was expected. The court dissolved the union, ruling that the two had ceased to be husband and wife, and could go their separate ways. It ordered the respondent to allow the petitioner move out her belongings peacefully and that any violation of the judgment would be regarded as contempt of court.
