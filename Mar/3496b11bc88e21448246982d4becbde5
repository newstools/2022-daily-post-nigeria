A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, has said Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has confirmed the party’s stance that the All Progressives Congress, APC, is a “Yahoo Yahoo” party. Ologbondiyan, who is the immediate past National Publicity Secretary of PDP, said Akeredolu’s recent remark confirmed that APC creates a cover for Yahoo Yahoo governors and electorates to operate. In a tweet, the former spokesman of the PDP maintained that the APC represents what a political party should not be. Ologbondiyan stressed that the former ruling party remains the only viable option for Nigerians in 2023. According to Ologbondiyan: “Governor @RotimiAkeredolu has validated the position of @OfficialPDPNig that the @OfficialAPCNg is a ‘yahoo yahoo’ party where ‘yahoo yahoo’ governors and other elected ‘yahoos’ operate. “Nigerians can now see that @OfficialAPCNg is a parody of whatever a political party should represent. Come 2023, PDP remains the option.” Yesterday, Akeredolu disclosed that his Yobe counterpart, Mai Mala Buni, had perfected moves to create a crisis for the APC ahead of the party’s March 26 national convention. Akeredolu, who frowned at the role of Buni while he held sway as the APC’s Chairman of the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, CECPC, stated that the Yobe State Governor had alongside few of his colleagues, whom he referred to as ‘yahoo yahoo’ governors, plotted to frustrate the convention from holding. The Governor, in a statement he personally signed on Thursday, said that President Muhammadu Buhari and majority of the governors’ quick action to save the party from “internal scavengers” was a tremendous move in avoiding the party from falling off the cliff.
