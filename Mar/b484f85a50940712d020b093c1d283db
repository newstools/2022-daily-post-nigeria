Spartak Moscow are eager to sell ex-Chelsea star, Victor Moses to Premier League club Burnley because the Russian club wants to offload his high wages. This claim was made by former Russian international, Sergei Kiriakov. Recall that Moses had agreed to terms with Burnley, but the proposed switch was blocked by the English Premier League (EPL) to protect the sporting integrity of the division. FIFA and UEFA earlier confirmed that European teams could register footballers from the Russian and Ukrainian Leagues after war broke out between the two neighbors. Foreign players who play in Russia and Ukraine were allowed to suspend their contracts until June and play for another team elsewhere. Speaking on the development, Kiriakov said to Sports.ru: “If the management really wants to unload the payroll, then the player should be released. “In this situation, everyone goes into economy mode. It is wrong to keep players with big salaries now.” Kiriakov added: “He was a main player, but he never became a superstar. More was expected from Moses. “His departure will not fundamentally affect Spartak. Victor is the main player of the red-whites, but nothing more.”
