Former Super Eagles star, Julius Aghahowa has predicted the outcome of the World Cup qualifying playoff between Nigeria and Ghana. Aghahowa believes the Super Eagles would beat Ghana in Friday evening’s 2022 World Cup qualifier at the Baba Yara Stadium, Kumasi. The former Nigeria international warned that Ghana will not allow the Super Eagles to win the match. Aghahowa predicted two goals scoreline in favour of the Nigerian side and that could mean that the Super Eagles would have one foot in Qatar by the time both sides return to Abuja for the second leg on Tuesday, March 29. “The rivalry between the two sides has been there. The Super Eagles should not forget that Ghana won’t let them come to their home and defeat them,” Aghahowa said on Channels TV on Friday morning. “They should expect difficulty there but at the end of the day we want to win, that’s the most important thing. “I expect the Super Eagles to win, if you look at the players man for man and the form, we have more players in different positions. “We are going to win by a goal or two in Ghana and then when we come back we’ll qualify”.
