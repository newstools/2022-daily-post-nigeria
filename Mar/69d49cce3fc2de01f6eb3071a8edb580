The ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, has reassured its members that the national convention slated for 26th March 2022 remains sacrosanct. The acting Chairman, APC Caretaker Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Abubakar Sani Bello gave the reassurance in a press statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, CPS, Mary Noel-Berje. Bello said his major task is to fix the party and ensure a successful national convention of the party at the stipulated date. He urged the newly sworn-in state chairmen to support him in achieving the desired result and build a solid platform for the younger members to benefit. “As leaders, we must be extremely careful so that we leave a very solid platform for the younger ones and for other people to benefit. “Our main task is to fix the party and hold Convention. We all should be worried about Convention. We need to hold our Convention so that we ratify past mistakes. I placed my absolute loyalty to you but I need your support”, he said. He further appealed to them to draw the attention of the national body on issues that are too difficult for them to resolve to avoid escalation.
