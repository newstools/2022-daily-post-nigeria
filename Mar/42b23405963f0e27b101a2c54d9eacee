The source of wealth of a former Governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has again come under heavy scrutiny. A former presidential aide during the last administration, Reno Omokri, pointed out that whereas Nigerians know at least a little about the source of wealth of some politicians such as Bukola Saraki and Uzor Urji Kalu, no one can say for sure how Tinubu made his money.

His father was a multimillionaire in US dollars. He had such and such assets. “But if you talk about Bola Tinubu, who were his parents? How old is he really? We don’t know. Okay now, How did he make his money and from what businesses? We don’t know. “All we know is that he worked in Mobile or even Chevron, so, where did all the money come from?

So, what are Bullion vans doing going into your house and coming out…”
