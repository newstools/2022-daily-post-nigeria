Former England boss, Fabio Capello, has told Italian managers they had become obsessed with trying to emulate Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola’s style of football. “Italian football has imitated Guardiola for 15 years,” Capello told Sky Sport Italia. Capello said this while lamenting Italy’s defeat to Macedonia in their World Cup playoff on Thursday, a loss that perished Azzurri hope of playing in Qatar in November. Capello, who has managed several clubs and countries around Europe, advised his countrymen to instead, switch to the German style of football instead of the Spanish way of playing that has not been fruitful. ‘There were no vertical passes or physical strength, there is no habit to making challenges. On the other hand, we should follow Jurgen Klopp’s playing style. “The German way is the model to follow, we don’t have the technique to look at the Spanish one. “There is a high pace in European competition and we are not accustomed to it,” the ex-coach said.
