Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick has admitted he thought the Red Devils were the “worst team he has ever coached” after the 4-1 derby defeat to Manchester City. However, following their 3-2 win over Tottenham on Saturday, he insisted he is now dreaming about winning the Champions League. Ronaldo’s hat-trick against Spurs at Old Trafford came three days before United welcome Atletico Madrid in their last-16 second leg. The 37-year-old’s form has led to questions about whether he could win the title for a sixth time this season. “This is what I also like about this club. “On Sunday, I almost felt like we were at a funeral, that it was already dead. I felt like it’s the worst team I ever coached. “And after the 3-2 win against Tottenham we’re discussing about our chances to win the Champions League. Ask me that question should we reach the final of the Champions League, then you can ask me that question again,” Rangick said. United face Atletico on Tuesday after drawing 1-1 in Spain.
