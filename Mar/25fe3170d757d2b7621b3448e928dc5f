The Northern Senators Forum (NSF), on Wednesday, expressed outrage and shock over bandits’ attack on a Kaduna-bound train. Bandits had attacked the Kaduna- Abuja train on Monday night, killing eight, while several others are missing. In a statement on Wednesday, by its Chairman, Senator Aliyu Wamakko, he urged the military to re-strategise in handling the security situation in the North West. He said the attack is a direct assault at the Nigerian State and its security forces. He described the attack as “heinous and unforgivable” and charged the security agencies to come together and pursue the criminals. According to him, “it is devastating hearing about the outrageous attack which brought to the fore, yet again, the nature of the problem we are dealing with.” Wamakko, who was a former governor of Sokoto State, and presently the chairman of the Senate Committee on Defence, said the loss of lives of innocent and defenceless Nigerians must be halted immediately. “It is sad that the precious lives of defenceless citizens get perished in the hands of callous and merciless terrorists “This is yet another wakeup call not only for our security forces, but indeed all Nigerians to be more decisive in ending this menace,” Wamakko said The statement condoled with His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari, the Kaduna State Government, as well as families and associates of those who lost their lives in the attack. “But as a tribute to those lost in the attack, we must ensure that their lives do not go in vain by bringing the perpetrators to book,” he said.
