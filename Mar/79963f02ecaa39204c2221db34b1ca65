Former Bournemouth head coach, Jonathan Woodgate has told Manchester United the perfect manager to coach their club. Woodgate believes former Chelsea and Inter Milan coach, Antonio Conte is the perfect manager to coach Man United. Man United had the opportunity to sign Conte last year after the Italian left Inter Milan. But the Red Devils instead continued with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Conte eventually joined Tottenham Hotspur, a few weeks before Solskjaer was sacked by Man United. Man United then appointed Ralf Rangnick on an interim basis and Woodgate believes the Old Trafford club missed a trick by not going for Conte. Speaking to Genting Casino, Woodgate said, “I was surprised by that as well because Man Utd want to win trophies, and they have had Moyes, Van Gaal, Mourinho, Solskjaer, why could not you get Antonio Conte when he’s available?” “He’s an outstanding manager. I don’t buy into people saying he’s not a Man Utd manager, what is?”” You had Alex Ferguson, the man who’s brought the most success, the others who followed him haven’t been able to get close to winning the Premier League. I think Antonio Conte would have been perfect for Man Utd.”
