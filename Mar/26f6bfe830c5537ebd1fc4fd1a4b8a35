Tottenham Hotspur manager, Antonio Conte, has said he feels sorry for his Chelsea counterpart, Thomas Tuchel, following the sanctions imposed on the Blues’ owner Roman Abramovich by the UK government. On Thursday, Abramovich’s assets were frozen by the UK government and he was also issued with a travel ban. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine there have been question marks over the 55-year-old and his links with Vladmir Putin. Chelsea will still be allowed to play, having been given a special sporting licence, which allows football activities to continue. Conte spent two years at Stamford Bridge, where he won the Premier League title. “Honestly, it’s a pity, also because I was coach in this club, in Chelsea, I enjoyed two seasons. “Also, I won two titles, I worked in this club. “It’s a pity to listen to this situation, it’s not simple for the players, it’s not simple for Thomas Tuchel, for the fans, for the whole environment, Chelsea environment,” Conte told a press conference today.
