Suspended DCP Abba Kyari and his co-defendant, ACP Sunday Ubia, on Monday, asked a Federal High Court, Abuja, to admit them to bail. Kyari and Ubia, through their lawyer, Mahmud Magaji, told Justice Emeka Nwite while arguing the bail application that his clients’ offences are bailable, adding that the constitution gave the court the discretionary power to do so. However, counsel to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Joseph Sunday, a Director of Prosecution and Legal Services, opposed the bail application. Also, counsel to other police officers in the matter, also urged the court to grant their clients bail. The matter is still ongoing as at the time of filing the report. (NAN)
