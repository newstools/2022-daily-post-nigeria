Nigeria’s Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami has denied exonerating a suspended police officer, Abba Kyari. The AGF made the clarification on Sunday through spokesman Umar Gwandu. The minister noted that there appears to be a “misunderstanding” regarding the issue. He said the case was in progress and that his office only requested “further probe in relation to some aspects of the investigation”. Malami maintained that “no conclusion has been reached in the direction of the absence of evidence relating to the First Report”. “The issues were raised for further investigation with a view to cover the field in the investigation in order to arrive at an informed decision”, the statement explained.
