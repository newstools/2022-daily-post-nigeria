Ghana head coach, Otto Addo, has claimed they know all what Nigerian players can do, ahead of the second leg of their 2022 World Cup playoff on Tuesday. Both West African rivals will clash again, four days after a 0-0 draw in Kumasi. The Black Stars dominated most of the match in the first leg, but created few chances to win the game. Addo has now admitted they made some mistakes on home soil and will be looking to rectify it in Abuja. “First of all, we did well even though we made some mistakes but we started well, there was just a little bit of fatigue and it made Nigeria come into the game more. “We watch a lot of matches, me and my squad… and I think we know what each of them is capable of,” Addo said.
