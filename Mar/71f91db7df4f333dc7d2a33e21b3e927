An Akure Magistrate’s Court has remanded three persons suspected to be kidnappers in the Olokuta Correctional Centre. The defendants, Mohammed Buhari, Ibrahim Garuba, and Ibrahim Sali, were accused of committing the crime on January 27, 2022, about 5 p.m., in Ifon axis, Ose Local Government Area of the state. According to the state Prosecutor, Oluwasegun Akeredolu, the defendants attempted to kidnap some people who were travelling on a public route. The accused were also said to have had guns in their possession with no explanation as to how they obtained them. The Prosecutor has stated that sections 516, 3, 2, and 4 of the Ondo State Anti-Kidnapping and Anti-Abduction Law 2010 make the act illegal and punished. The suspects, who were arraigned on a three-count charge, pleaded not guilty to all of them. Akeredolu made an oral application before the court to remand the defendants in custody pending guidance from the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP. However, the defendants’ Attorney, Okolike Nnagozie, objected to the prosecutor’s request and urged the court to grant his clients bail under the most generous terms possible. The defendants were subsequently remanded in the Olokuta Correctional Centre by Magistrate Damilola Sekoni, who adjourned the case to March 11, 2022.
