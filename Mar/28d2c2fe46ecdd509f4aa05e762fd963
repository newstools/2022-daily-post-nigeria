The Leader Of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, on Tuesday issued warnings about the upcoming national convention of the All Progressives Congress, APC. Primate Ayodele disclosed that the “cabals would influence President Muhammadu Buhari’s decision on APC’s National Chairman.” He noted that the cabals would decide the next APC National Chairman. In a statement by his spokesman, Oluwatosin Osho, Ayodele warned of impending danger. He warned that the APC national convention may lead to the breaking of the party “if they don’t put things in order.” Primate Ayodele disclosed that the next APC National Chairman would create a faction within the ruling party. The clergyman also noted that some governors would forgive the embattled National Chairman of the ruling party, Mai Mala Buni. According to Ayodele: “So many factors will determine the next APC National chairman, two major politicians will be on the contest and President Buhari’s decision will be directed by the cabals. The cabals will pick the next chairman of the APC and the presidential candidate. “There is still danger laying ahead of APC Convention and so many people will be disappointed, The person that will be chosen as the party chairman will create factions within the party, this will make some people not to come to political limelight again.”
