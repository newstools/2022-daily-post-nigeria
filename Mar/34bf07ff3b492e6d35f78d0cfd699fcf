Grow Nigeria Youth Movement (GNYM) has lambasted the All Progressives Congress (APC) for attacking ex-Senate President Bukola Saraki. The party had condemned Saraki’s reaction to the impeachment of Zamfara Deputy Governor, Mahdi Aliyu Gusau. At a briefing on Wednesday, GNYM Convener, Mustapha Bungudu, lampooned APC Publicity Secretary, Yusuf Gusau. Bungudu called his comments “comedic display of politically-motivated ignorance”. He said the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant should not be attacked for speaking the truth to power. “We need to stop playing politics and address the issues at hand”, Gusau said. “Instead of attacking Saraki, they should focus on actually delivering the promises they made to uphold the constitution.” The body told the former Kwara Governor to ignore “detractors” engaging in “nonsense” and continue to speak the mind of the people.
