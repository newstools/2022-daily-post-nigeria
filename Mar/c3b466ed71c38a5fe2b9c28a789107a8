Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) Chairman, Kayode Fayemi, says governors’ monthly security vote are used to support security agencies. Fayemi spoke on Thursday in Abuja at a stakeholders meeting on ‘Peace and Inclusive Security Initiative’. At the event organised by the NGF and the Center for Democracy and Development (CDD), the Ekiti Governor clarified that not all governors get the vote. He advised the gathering to look for a book by Chief Jerome Ugoji – ‘Serving three masters’ to know the origin of funds. “l can’t speak for others, but I also get feedbacks from other states in my capacity as chairman of the governors forum. “There is hardly any of these institutions that you are talking about that we do not fund. We fund the police. “Quote me, governors fund police more than the Federal Government. We buy them vehicles, pay allowances. In some cases, we buy ammunition. “If we are to engage our military in aid to civil authority, which you will find actually in 36 states, we fund it”, NAN quoted him saying. Fayemi lamented that the Armed Forces were drafted into internal security operations. He added that citizens sometimes ask governors to engage soldiers, even though military roadblocks could not be set up everywhere. The Ekiti helmsman said any state that invites soldiers is responsible for payment of their service as civil operations aren’t their primary responsibility.
