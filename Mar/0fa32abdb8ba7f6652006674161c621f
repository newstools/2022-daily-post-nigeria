Ex-Manchester United captain, Gary Neville, is backing his former club to beat Arsenal to fourth place, despite their demoralising Champions League exit. The Red Devils were eliminated from Europe’s club competition by Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. Ralf Rangnick’s men are now focused on finishing in the top four places. United are currently in fifth place with nine fixtures left, one point behind Arsenal who have 11 matches to play. “I don’t know why but I still think they (United) could finish fourth. Whether that’s wild hope or the devil in me. But I still think they could do it and Arsenal might drop out. “It wouldn’t surprise me if they didn’t and if Arsenal finished fourth you’d have to congratulate them. But it also wouldn’t surprise me if United got it. “If I was a betting man, which I’m not, I would probably go for Manchester United. I don’t know why, but there’s something about them that makes me think they will do it.”
