Former Chelsea midfielder, Joe Cole has singled out Mason Mount for special praise following his display in the Blues’ Champions League 2-1 victory against Lille on Wednesday night. Mount came in as a half-time substitute to turn the game in Chelsea’s favor. The England international replaced Mateo Kovacic and aided Chelsea’s attack by being an extra body up front as two goals from Christian Pulisic and Cesar Azpilicueta gave Chelsea the win against Lille in France. The 23-year-old provided an assist for Azpilicueta in the second half. But Cole believes Mount contributed to a better second-half display for Thomas Tuchel’s side, adding that he looked excellent during the encounter. Speaking on BT Sport, Cole said, “Second-half was a lot better, a lot more assured. Mason Mount came on and looked excellent. Wonderful cross for the [Azpilicueta] goal.” Chelsea’s next game is against Middlesbrough in the FA Cup on Saturday.
