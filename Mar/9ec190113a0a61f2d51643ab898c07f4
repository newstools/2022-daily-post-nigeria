Gbenga Daniel, a former Ogun Governor, said on Saturday that skeptics will be proven wrong at the end of today’s All Progressives Congress (APC) National Convention. Daniel told NAN at Eagles Square, Abuja, the venue of the convention, that the APC was a great party. He said,” APC is a very big party. We’re going to have a safe convention at the end of the day.” The former governor said that the exercise would be successful while the outcome would be acceptable to everyone. The APC chieftain said,” Where there’s consensus, it’s okay, and where there is none, elections will peacefully hold.” According to Daniel, all the ‘big names’ in Ogun are in APC. “We’re one family,” he added.
