Affected parties are Advanced Congress of Democrats, ACD, Advanced Nigeria Democratic Party, ANDP, All Blending Party ABP, All Grand Alliance Party, AGAP, Alliance of Social Democrats, ACD, Change Advocacy Party, CAP, Democratic Peoples Congress, DPC, Green Party of Nigeria, GPN.

The rest are Re-build Nigeria Party, RBNP, Save Nigeria Congress, SNC, Socialist Party of Nigeria, SPN, United Democratic Party, UDP, United Patriots, UP, and We the People Nigeria, WTPN, At the time of this report, the Supreme Court premises has been jam-packed by leaders of the 23 parties, as well as their followers and sympathisers. The parties had lost their legal battle on the de-registration at the Federal High Court in a judgment delivered by Justice Taiwo Oladipupo Taiwo who held that the electoral body had power to axe them. The Court of Appeal in Abuja, however, upturned the High Court verdict on the ground that INEC did not follow due process of law.
