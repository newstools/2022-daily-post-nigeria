Operatives of the Kebbi State Hisbah Board confiscated more than two hundred cartons of different brands of alcohol in Birnin Kebbi on Saturday. The Board’s Commandant, Alhaji Suleiman Mohammed, who disclosed this to newsmen in Birnin Kebbi on Saturday, said the Board has also apprehended the owner. He said his operatives, who acted on a tip-off, swooped on a particular location around the old market area in Birnin Kebbi metropolis where they impounded a vehicle laden with the banned products which was about to be offloaded for sale to the general public. The Commandant pledged that the Board will continue to enforce laws of the state that prohibit the sales and consumption of alcohol in all parts of the state with the exception of barracks and similar outposts. He noted that the matter will be further investigated and the case will be handled in accordance with the law. Alhaji Suleiman Mohammed, however, warned those he termed as ‘habitual law breakers’ who take pleasure in undermining the peaceful coexistence of the people in the state, to desist from their nefarious activities or face the full wrath of the law.
