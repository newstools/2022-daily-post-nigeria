Nigerian forward, Emmanuel Dennis, has said the Super Eagles’ 2022 FIFA World Cup playoff against the Black Stars of Ghana is a do-or-die match. Dennis said the Super Eagles are ready to shed their blood and sweat against Ghana to qualify Nigeria for the World Cup in Qatar. Nigeria will host Ghana at the Moshood Abiola Stadium on Tuesday evening in the second leg playoff, having played a 0-0 draw with their West African neighbour in Kumasi last Friday. And the Watford star believes the tie is the biggest match of his life and career. “These games are the biggest games of my life and my career. We must go all out for our country. It’s do or die. Players must be ready to drop our blood and sweat on the pitch to qualify for the World Cup,” Dennis told BBC Sport Africa. “I have never thought in my head that we didn’t qualify. Impossible. If I’m going to die on the pitch, let me die playing for my people,” he added. “You play this tournament one time every four years, and before the four years, you don’t even know what can happen. You can even die before the next one. “You might not even be playing football. So many things can happen. So, if you get the opportunity, you need to write history. We have to come out and give everything. “We don’t need all the criticism as we must all come together as one to support the players, the country and make sure we are the ones going to the World Cup and not our opponent.”
