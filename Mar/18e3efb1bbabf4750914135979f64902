The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), on Thursday, warned that there would be no extension of registration for 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, UTME, candidates. Fabian Benjamin, spokesman for JAMB, while giving the warning in a statement in Abuja on Thursday, advised all prospective candidates in the ongoing 2022 UTME and Direct Entry (DE) Registration exercises to make sure they complete their registrations before March 26, 2022, adding that there will be no extension of date. He said the only window allotted by relevant authorities to the board to conduct the exercise is between 19th February, to 26th March, 2022, only. He noted that, it was practically impossible for the board to even contemplate any extension of registration as sister examination bodies such as West African Examination Council (WAEC), National Examination Council (NECO) and National Business and Technical Examination Board (NABTEB), have their allotted time which the board could not usurp. He added that before the commencement of registration or examination for any given year, all public examination bodies are invited to a roundtable where they are expected to agree on the timetable of activities for each examination agency and which must be strictly adhered to. He noted that registration and examination dates are usually not fixed arbitrarily but through a consensus of opinions of the Federal Ministry of Education and examination agencies. He said the announcement was necessary because of the drop in the number of candidates coming forward to register in spite of the capacity of the Board to register more daily. “By this announcement, the board is urging prospective candidates who desire to register for the 2022/23 UTME/DE to come out to register as they have only two weeks to do so as no extension would be granted after the close of registration,” he said.
