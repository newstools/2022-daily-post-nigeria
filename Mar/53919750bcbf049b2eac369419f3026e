The Jos Resident Pastor of Shepherd House Assembly International, Rev. Tajan Moltok says the quest for money has become a national problem. The cleric on Sunday lamented the rise in cases of ritual killings, armed robbery and other ungodly acts. Moltok condemned the “get-rich-quick syndrome” by youths and urged them not to see life as a competition. He appealed to Nigerians to exercise restraint while seeking wealth, be patient and diligent in their endeavours. The religious leader reminded young citizens that God is the rewarder of hard work and will grant their desires. “Pursue righteousness and flee youthful lust. If you are diligent in what you do, God will honour you”, NAN quoted him saying. “If you are a student, be patient. Be humble, if you are learning a trade under someone, do not feel you know better. “Everyone has their time and path. If you flee from youthful lust God will use you mightily.” Moltok implored youths not to give up no matter the challenges, but pray to make more impact and affect souls. In recent years, a number of missing girls/women were later found dead with vital body parts removed, mostly for ritual purposes.
