Former Manchester United player, Teddy Sheringham, has urged the club to sign ‘best midfielder in the world,’ Declan Rice, to replace Paul Pogba in the summer. Pogba looks set to leave Man United at the end of the season as talks over a contract extension have stalled. The France World Cup winner is yet to sign a new contract with Man United. His contract with the club will expire at the end of the current season. And Sheringham believes Rice, who currently plays for West Ham, would be an upgrade of Pogba at the Red Devils. “It is going to be hard for West Ham to keep Declan Rice,” Sheringham told Lord Ping. “I spoke to West Ham supporters and said, “he’s the best midfielder in the world at the moment”. I rate him highly. He’s got everything a central midfielder needs. “He understands the game, he has got good pace, he can control the ball, pass it, make good tackles and get forward. “He has the stature of Steven Gerrard in midfield, he has that dominant now that even when he has got closed down, he’s got good pace and power about him that he can get away from midfielders. That is very unusual to have that in a central midfield position. “[Declan would be an upgrade on Paul Pogba] because he is the best midfielder in the world. Pogba is a talented boy, but leads with the wrong character. “He does not inspire people around him, he does not inspire his supporters around him whereas someone like Declan does. You want to roll with him, the way he plays the game.”
