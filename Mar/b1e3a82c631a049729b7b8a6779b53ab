Ahead of the 2023 general elections, former Minister of Works, Dr. Mike Onolememen, has picked the Peoples Democratic Party expression of interest and nomination forms for the Edo Central Senatorial District election. The former minister worked under the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan. Onolememen was spotted on Wednesday at the PDP national secretariat where he collected the senatorial forms confirming his latest intentions. The former works minister who has remained in the opposition since the last political dispensation is believed to have a strong chance of picking the ticket given his strong entrenchment in PDP both at the state, regional and national level.
