Anambra State Police Command has said that it has begun immediate implementation of the directive of the state governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, to rid Anambra of revenue louts. Soludo while speaking to residents of Okpoko, a slum near Onitsha had abolished all manner of touting, especially as it has to do with revenue collection. In a press release by the state police command’s spokesperson, DSP Toochukwu Ikenga, the command said it is ready to carry out the directive. Ikenga in the release wrote: “The Commissioner of Police, Anambra Command, CP Echeng Echeng, has given marching orders to the Heads of Tactical Units, Divisional Police Officers (DPOs) and Heads of Departments (HODs) across the Command to strictly enforce the pronouncement by Anambra State Government, on ban on louting and self-acclaimed revenue collectors in the state. “The CP, who gave this order today, 20th March, 2022 (Sunday) at the Anambra Police Command Headquarters, Awka, enjoined the officers to ensure full compliance with the order especially at motor parks and other designated places within the state.” He said the CP also warned all persons who engage in touting and other unlawful acts to desist forthwith as the police and other security agents have been deployed around the State to arrest and bring to justice anyone caught flouting this order. He said CP Echeng reaffirmed the commitment of the Command towards crime prevention, restoration of law and order, while enjoining Anambra people and all residents of the State to be vigilant and security conscious at all times and to report all suspicious movements to the police.
