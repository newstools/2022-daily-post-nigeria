Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu says the platform will zone political offices ahead of the 2023 Nigeria elections. The former Senate President spoke in Abuja while inaugurating the 37-member zoning committee at the national secretariat in Abuja. Ayu told those who fail to get tickets for interested offices to wait for the next political season. The PDP constituted the body to make recommendations for the zoning of various elective positions. The team is expected to submit its final zoning list on Wednesday March 30. On Thursday, Ayu reminded top party executives and stalwarts that the “PDP has a history of rotating offices.” “Anybody who doesn’t get it this time should wait after the tenure of whoever will be our next president. “PDP is going to produce the next President once we start this journey. We will ensure it goes round; it will go round with justice, fairness and the interest of Nigeria.” Ayu charged the zoning committee not to lose sight of the big picture in their “very sensitive assignment”. The PDP Chairman said they were free to advance your arguments “but let there be no rancour”. “You should focus on the main goal which is to win presidential power and commence the rebuilding of the country. “PDP has a reputation for discussion. That’s our tradition. We talk about everything, including the fair distribution of offices. We don’t fight, that’s the spirit of our party”, he added.
