Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has said Mohamed Salah will undergo tests to determine the extent of the foot injury he sustained in their 2-0 win at Brighton on Saturday. Salah hobbled off the pitch shortly after converting a penalty to put his side two goals off. Speaking after the game, Klopp admitted he is not sure if the injury is more serious than first thought. “He got blocked before the penalty, when he shot the ball he overstretched his foot slightly. “He felt it then a little bit higher, but he’s not concerned. I’m not sure what that means exactly. “Obviously we all know that Mo is not injured that often, and I hope it stays like this. He thinks it will be fine but we will see. You could see he couldn’t walk properly, so we need further assessment for sure. “We’d have taken him off whatever the result. We have options. Bobby [Firmino] didn’t even play today. I saw [the injury] immediately, then it went quite quickly, penalty, bam bam. Then after that, you see him going down. I’m not sure that happened before with Mo, to be honest,” Klopp said.
