Real Madrid goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois has hit out at the Los Blancos’ attitude for ‘not fighting in the second half’ following their LaLiga El Clasico 4-0 defeat against Barcelona. Courtois said Real Madrid players were missing during the clash against Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabeu. The former Chelsea shot-stopper said his team offered an “unacceptable image” as they were smashed by Barcelona following goals from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (2), Ronald Araujo and Ferran Torres. “Today we gave an unacceptable image to this club. There are players missing, but you didn’t notice that it was them that played Thursday (in Istanbul). They found a lot of space. We weren’t compact and weren’t able to keep the goals out. For the first goal, they anticipate better at the front post and we’re not switched on for the second either. After the break, we think we can come back, and after 10 seconds Ferran Torres is one on one with me,” Courtois told Movistar. “We will have to talk about the tactics internally. “They haven’t worked at the start of the game or the second half… we have to discuss it internally, not here. “We played with a false nine in the Copa and hardly had any shots and it was the same here. We started OK, we had a chance with Fede Valverde which Marcter Stegen saved well, but from there we dropped off. We didn’t find the free man playing out and that makes it hard. Then in the second half, we cannot start like that. This badge demands that you fight and in the second half we did not. We could have lost even more,” he added.
