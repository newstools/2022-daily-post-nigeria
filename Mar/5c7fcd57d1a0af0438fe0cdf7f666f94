The Premier League has blocked Burnley’s attempt to rescue Victor Moses from Spartak Moscow, according to SportsMail. The Clarets tried to clinch a deal to bring the ex-Chelsea forward from Russia, who are in the midst of a conflict with Ukraine. Moses, Burnley and Spartak Moscow were all open to the former Super Eagles star returning to play in England until the end of the season. The 31-year-old joined Spartak Moscow in 2020 on an initial loan before the deal was made permanent in 2021 But the Premier League club have been informed that they cannot sign Moses on a short-term deal. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last month led to both the domestic leagues being suspended. As a result, FIFA and UEFA made the joint decision to allow players from teams in Ukraine and Russia to join other European teams on short-term deals until the end of the season – even though the transfer window is shut. However, the Premier League have ruled they will not accept any requests for new transfers due to concerns over the sporting integrity of the competition.
