Pro-Biafra agitator, Nnamdi Kanu has expressed optimism of emerging victorious despite his terrorism charges at an Abuja Federal High. To this end, Kanu urged his counsels to always make time to hang out and enjoy some bottles of drinks. The leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, is facing charges bordering on terrorism before Justice Binta Nyako of an Abuja Federal High Court. Kanu was charged with terrorism due to his agitation for the actualization of Biafra. He is currently locked up by the Department of State Services, DSS after he was rearrested in Kenya and repatriated in 2021. Despite the charges and ongoing trial, the IPOB has predicted his victory at the end of the case. Kanu disclosed this during his routine meeting with his legal team at the DSS facility in Abuja. A statement by his Counsel, Ifeanyi Ejiofor on Friday, said Kanu urged all his followers to remain united, peaceful and prayerful because victory is certain. The statement reads partly: “The court-ordered routine visit to our indefatigable client – Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu was observed on (Thursday) March 3, 2022. After days, which turned into weeks of grandstanding, we were able to meet with our client- Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu “On a lighter note, Onyendu requested his visiting team to make time to hang out and enjoy some bottles of drinks. “In summary, Onyendu is in a very strong and firm spirit now than before. He implores all his followers and Umuchineke to remain undivided, resolute, and unshaken in their resolve for victory. “Onyendu assures everyone that he will come out victorious and stronger. He commended his supporters and Umuchineke, and urged you to remain prayerful and continue to be peaceful in your conduct as you have always demonstrated over time.”
