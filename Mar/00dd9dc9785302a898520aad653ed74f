Civil servants in Anambra State Monday defied State Government’s directive to come to work every Monday against the Independent People of Biafra’s (IPOB) sit-at-home order. NAN correspondent, who monitored the situation in Awka, reports that most government offices visited were under lock and key. DAILY POST recalls that the Governor Charles Soludo’s government had, on March 25, sent out a circular directing workers to report to their duty posts on Mondays. The statement, which was signed by the Head of Service, Mrs Theodora Igwegbe said absence from duty on Mondays or any other official workday without approval will be viewed as serious misconduct which will attract appropriate sanctions.. However, only a few junior workers were seen loitering around the state secretariat complex on Monday, March 28. According to NAN, even the Office of the Head of Service, together with the ministries in the block, was also under lock and key. Most staff buses, which convey workers to and fro their offices were also seen parked in the secretariat. Some of the buses included Route 1 for Awka- Ogidi-Onitsha, Route 2 for Awkuzu-Otuocha and Route 4 for Awka-Agulu-Ekwulobia.
