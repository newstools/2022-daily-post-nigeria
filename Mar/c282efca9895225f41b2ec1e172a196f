Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen has reportedly decided to join Barcelona at the end of the season. Christensen has given Barcelona a ‘verbal okay’ to join the Catalan club when his contract at Stamford Bridge expires, according to Sport. Christensen’s current contract with Chelsea will expire at the end of the season and he looks set for an exit. The 25-year-old is yet to sign a new contract with Chelsea and has already told the LaLiga giants he will join them in the summer. The report added that a four-year contract is ‘practically agreed’, and while the deal is still in need of a ‘definitive signature’, Christensen has already given a verbal okay to join the Blaugrana in the summer. Chelsea is set to hold a final meeting with Christensen to convince him to stay rather than leave for Barcelona.
