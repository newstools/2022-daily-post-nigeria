The All Progressives Congress (APC) national chairman, Abudullahi Adamu says God helped him to win the March 26 convention. The former Nasarawa Governor spoke on Wednesday at the APC national secretariat after the handover by Yobe Governor, Mai Buni. Buni led the Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) since 2020 after the removal of Adams Oshiomhole. “It is only through God that we have emerged as the NWC. It is not our doing, but the doing of Almighty God who made all this possible. “A month ago, I didn’t know I will become the chairman of APC. Here I am today, receiving the instrument. “Only God can do this. It is not my personal wisdom nor my charisma. There may be elements on the way.” The lawmaker thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for his commitment to the development of the party. Adamu also hailed the leaders for ensuring his emergence and prayed God to reward them. The chairman noted that the APC would begin work on the 2023 general elections in earnest.
