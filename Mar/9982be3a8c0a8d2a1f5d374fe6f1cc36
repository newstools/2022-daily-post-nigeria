The United Nations, UN, has released the total number of civilians killed in Ukraine since February 24, 2020 when Russia invaded Ukraine. According to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, (OHCHR) at least 902 civilians have been killed and 1,459 injured. The Commission said that most of these civilians were killed by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, such as shelling from heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes. In a statement on Sunday, the UN body detailed the 902 deaths as “179 men, 134 women, 11 girls, and 25 boys, as well as 39 children and 514 adults whose sex is yet unknown.” OHCHR said that 248 civilians had died in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. According to the UN Office, the actual figures could be “considerably higher, especially in Government-controlled territory and especially in recent days. OHCHR said this would be the case for (among others) the city Mariupol, “where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties,” adding that the figures were being “further corroborated and not included in the above statistics.”
