A rainstorm, on Wednesday, swept away a 60-year-old petty trader in Nkemba Street Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital, and drowned her in an open drainage. DAILY POST had reported that the rainstorm also destroyed a church and its properties. A resident of the area, Anietie Sam, who narrated the incident to newsmen on Friday, said the victim while returning from the market in the rain at about 4:30 pm was swept away by the flood. He added that efforts to rescue her were abortive as the storm pushed her fast to an open hole that linked the underground drainage facility where she drowned. “Actually we made efforts to rescue the woman but it was difficult because she was swept away uncontrollably by the flood to an open hole linking the underground drainage facility,” he said. He lamented that about three years ago, officials of the state waste management and environmental protection agency had opened the slabs to remove sewage and clear the drains, but failed to cover it back. Meanwhile, the youths of the area, who protested the death of the woman, called on the state government to recover her remains and compensate the family as well as give her a befitting burial. Speaking on behalf of the youths, Comrade Effiong Asuquo blamed the Ministry of Environment and Solid Minerals for what he described as a “lack of sincere commitment to environmental protection”. However, the Commissioner for Environment and Solid Mineral, Sir Charles Udoh, expressed a deep sense of sadness over the incident and appealed for calm as frantic efforts were on to retrieve the corpse for burial. “I am on the spot of the incident right now to find the dead body. So, I have ordered for equipment to come. We need to break the slabs and the gutters so we can pull them to find the dead body. “After that, I will do a proposal to the governor on how to prevent future occurrence”, he assured.
