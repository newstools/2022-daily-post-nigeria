Nigeria midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, has warned his teammates to be careful ahead of this month’s 2022 World Cup playoffs against Ghana. The Leicester City star warned his colleagues not to mark out a single Black Stars’ player. The first leg of the tie will be played in Cape Coast on March 25, before Abuja hosts the reverse fixture four days later. Ndidi has been included in the 32-man squad for both games by interim head coach, Augustine Eguavoen and is very keen to play in the World Cup again. “It will mean a lot for us to go back to the World Cup,” Ndidi told ESPN. “But Ghana will not be easy. To be honest, we have to be careful about their whole team and not just any specific players. It will be two tough games.”
