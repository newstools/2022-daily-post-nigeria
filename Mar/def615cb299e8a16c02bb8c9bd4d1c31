The Anambra State Police Command has confirmed the burning to death of three suspected thieves at the popular Upper Iweka Junction in Onitsha. The three men were burnt by a mob on Thursday morning after they dispossessed a victim of his phone and tried to escape with the tricycle, which incidentally developed a fault. The state command’s spokesperson, DSP Toochukwu Ikenga, said men of the command rushed to the scene immediately they were alerted, but unlucky for the suspected thieves, their bodies were already smouldering in the fire. A release by Ikenga stated: “Anambra Police Operatives have recovered a tricycle, handbag and an Infinix phone that was allegedly dispossessed from a female victim by hoodlums operating along Owerri road, Romchi transport park, Onitsha. “Upon police arrival, an angry mob had already set three of the hoodlums ablaze and the fourth person escaped “Meanwhile, police operatives are already on the ground there and efforts are emplaced to bring normalcy to the area and possibly to apprehend the fleeing gang member.” Ikenga quoted the Commissioner of Police, CP Echeng Echeng, as frowning at the act. “He thanked the members of the public for assisting the Police in apprehending suspected criminals but urged them to always exercise restraint by not taking the law into their hands. They should endeavour to take such suspects to the nearest Police Station whenever they are apprehended. “This would afford the Police the opportunity to conduct an appropriate investigation into the nefarious activities of the suspects; and bring them to justice in accordance with extant laws,” Ikenga quoted Echeng as saying.
