Legal practitioner Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa has expressed sadness over the judgment of a Federal High Court which nullified section 84(12) of the Electoral Act. The verdict was given by Justice Evelyn Anyadike of the Federal High Court Unuahia. The section says no political appointee shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party. While signing the Electoral Act, President Muhammadu Buhari asked the National Assembly to delete it. Reacting to the court order, Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami said the Federal Government would act accordingly. “The Act will be gazetted factoring the effect of the judgment into consideration and deleting the constitutionally offensive provision accordingly”, he said. In a statement on Saturday, Adegboruwa declared: “May the judiciary not destroy Nigeria in our lifetime.” Noting that the National Assembly decided on the section, he wondered why the legislature wasn’t heard in court. “How can you “nullify” an Act without joining the institution that made the Act, so that they can be heard concerning what they did?” “When a defendant (Federal Government) rejoices over a judgment delivered against it as a party, then you know there is a problem in Nigeria.” Adegboruwa urged the National Assembly, parties and non-governmental organizations to appeal against the judgment. “Why do you want to hold on to your office as a political appointee and at the same time be a candidate in an election? “May Nigeria not happen to us in this way”, the Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) added.
