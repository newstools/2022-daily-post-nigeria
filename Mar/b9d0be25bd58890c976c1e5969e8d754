The Registrar, Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Prof Is-haq Oloyede, has appealed to CBT centre owners to remain calm. Oloyede said the Board is not oblivious of their plight regarding the high cost of diesel in the country. His message was conveyed in a statement by Fabian Benjamin, Head of Public Relations and Protocol. The Registrar spoke while on the last lap of the monitoring tour of the 2022 UTME/DE registration exercise scheduled to end on March 26. He disclosed that JAMB was in consultation with relevant government agencies to provide remedies as part of its strategies for a holistic solution. Oloyede reiterated the Board’s desire to offer critical support to its service partners at every point of its operational processes. The Registrar admitted the heavy reliance on diesel-powered generators to administer the examination in many centres. “JAMB would always go the extra mile to render support to its critical partners such that no service provider would have any excuse for failure”, he said. Oloyede further assured of necessary palliatives to CBT centres within approved government limits. The official reiterated that the 26th March, 2022 closing date for the sale of the 2022/23 UTME application documents to prospective candidates would not be extended.
