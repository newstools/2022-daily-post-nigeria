Sky Sports’ Kaveh Solhekol has explained what the UK government’s sanctions against Roman Abramovich mean for Chelsea. DAILY POST reports that the Russian billionaire was finally sanctioned by the UK government on Thursday. The Russian billionaire had his assets frozen and has been prohibited from making transactions with UK individuals and businesses. However, according to Solhekol, the sanctions against Abramovich means Chelsea would not be able to sign new players, but can continue to operate their day to day business such as their fixtures and paying players their weekly wages. Speaking on what Abramovich’s sanction means for Chelsea, Solhekol told The FOOTBALL SHOW: “Chelsea football club itself is seen by the government as being a significant cultural asset. “Thereby, they have given Chelsea a license which means despite the sanctions on their owner [Roman Abramovich], they would be able to carry operating. “They would be able to carry on fulfilling their fixtures, but effectively they are in limbo. “There are a lot of things they cannot do, so for instance, they can carry on to pay their players, but they would not be able to make signings. They can’t sell tickets. As it is, only season ticket holders or people who already bought tickets can go watch their games. “They will not be able to make any money from merchandise. Now according to the government, what Chelsea can do will be carrying on paying players, carrying on day-to-day bills. “What it means for Chelsea as a club for a short time, they can carry on operating on day to day basis, match basis but on a long term the future is very, very uncertain.”
