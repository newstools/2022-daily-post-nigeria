The Police in Enugu State, have invited for questioning, the factional chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Enugu State, Barr. Ugochukwu Agballa. Our correspondent gathered that the invitation was sequel to a petition by the coordinator of the APC 2022 Local Government Council candidates’ forum, Hon Victor Ofordi Nwankwo. The forum had in a 22 paragraph petition sent to the Commissioner of Police, Enugu State Command, on the 11th of February, 2022, accused Barr. Agballa of forging APC party membership card, which he used to swear affidavit in some courts. There are litany of cases filed against Agballa over his membership of the APC in Enugu State. Nwankwo, in a 22-paragraph petition to the police, had said Agballa indicated interest to join the party sometime in July, 2021, whereas the membership registration ended earlier in March 31, 2021. He declared that, “we are all aware that it was not possible for him to be issued with a membership registration slip in July, 2021, months after the March 31, 2021 closing date for registration of intending members.” He alleged that the membership slip being paraded by Agballa “was cloned from an old discarded registration slip used by the party in the 2014/2018 registration exercise. “That the said Mr. Agballa on being taken to the Federal High Court, (civil suit) Abuja to clearly ascertain his membership went further to forge another membership slip and Udi Agbudu ward register of members with the intention to cover his tracks.” According to information gathered by our correspondent from a police source, the Enugu command has commenced investigation on the said matter, and has equally invited the defendant for questioning. Meanwhile, Agballa has continued to dismiss all the allegations against him.
