Tottenham Hotspur boss, Antonio Conte, has blamed their poor game management on their 3-2 defeat to Manchester United on Saturday. Spurs lost ground in the race for top four places, despite equalizing twice against the Red Devils. Cristiano Ronaldo opened scoring from a distance before Harry Kane made it 1-1 from the spot. Ronaldo finished off Jadon Sancho’s move, but Conte’s men were level again thanks to Harry Maguire’s own goal. With 10 minutes left, Ronaldo rose highest to thump home the winner. “We have to try to improve with experience, to manage the game. “And the game is not one game, there are many parts of the game. There are moments to push high, go strong, push to win duels, and moments to keep possession, be calm. “We are drawing and after one minute we conceded a goal. We draw 2-2 and then we concede a goal on set pieces. But we are working on this. It is not that we are not working. They need time to improve. You can see that improvement on the pitch. But it is a process, you need time and patience,” Conte said.
