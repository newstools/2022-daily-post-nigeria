The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Osun State Command and National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in the State have launched partnership to destroy local plants of clandestine methamphetamine laboratories. This is sequel to the House of Representatives’ motion and resolution in November 2021, on the danger of widespread Methamphetamine Epidemic and Effect of Crystal Meth on the Nigerian youths. The House of Representatives asked the NDLEA to seek collaborations with all security agencies in the country to raid and destroy the local plants of clandestine methamphetamine. While shedding more light on the clandestine laboratories which were ordered to be destroyed, the State’s NDLEA Commander, Ogunbiyi explained that the product is not common in Nigeria, but illegally imported into the country by unscrupulous elements and their foreign collaborators. He stressed further that the products have been sighted in Nigeria, and was common in some urban areas of the country. He also hinted that clandestine laboratories are mostly found among successful businessmen, as it is expensive and addictive in nature, adding that the moment those involved start taking the drug, they find it difficult to stop until they finish selling their property. Commending the NSCDC in the State for a robust collaboration and synergy between the Corps and his agency, the NDLEA boss called for a renewed effort. In his response, the Commandant, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Osun State Command, Commandant Emmanuel Ocheja assured the Commander of NDLEA of the Command’s readiness to have a joint operation with the agency in order to raid and destroy the local plants and other illicit drugs. Represented by the Head of Crisis Management Department, Deputy Commandant of Corps (DCC) Sanusi Hussein, the NSCDC, in a statement by the command’s spokesperson, ASCII Olabisi Olabisi stressed that one should not rule out the possibility of having clandestine laboratories in Osun State.
