Two Ukrainian football stars, Vitalii Sapylo and Dmytro Martynenko have been killed fighting against the Russian invasion. The International Federation of Professional Footballers (FIFPRO) announced the death of Sapylo and Martynenko in a tweet via their Twitter handle. “Our thoughts are with the families, friends, and teammates of young Ukrainian footballers Vitalii Sapylo (21) and Dmytro Martynenko (25), football’s first reported losses in this war,” FIFPRO announced. “May they both rest in peace.” Meanwhile, the war between Russia and Ukraine began last Thursday. The war enters its eighth day today with huge casualties already recorded. President Putin had ordered the invasion of Ukraine over disagreement on some political issues.
