Three suspected internet fraudsters have been arrested by the Benin Zonal Command of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC. The suspects were identified as Omoghan Destiny Igbinosa, Ossien Godwin Isioma and Obiora Divine Chijoke. They were arrested following a petition by a Bureau De Change operator. The Commission, in a statement on its website, alleged that one of the suspects had contacted the operator for his account details which he obliged him. He said he later received the sum of $4950 and transferred the Naira equivalent to one of the suspects. The complainant further alleged that recently, without his consent, the sum of $2235USD was transferred to his account and that when he went to withdraw the money, he was told that a lien had been placed on the account on the grounds of suspicious transaction. The suspects were subsequently arrested when they came to collect the money from the Bureau de Change operator. The anti-graft agency added that the suspects have made useful statements and will be arraigned in court as soon as investigation is completed.
