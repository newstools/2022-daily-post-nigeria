Chelsea defender, Thiago Silva, has spoken about the importance of team-mate Cesar Azpilicueta, who he described as a “spectacular footballer” as Barcelona consider poaching the defender. Azpilicueta has made over 450 appearances for the Blues since signing from Marseille 10 years ago. The Spaniard has gone on to win every major trophy on offer during his spell at Stamford Bridge. However, Azpilicueta has been heavily linked with a move away from Chelsea, as he enters the final months of his contract with the club. The Premier League club was hoping to tie down Azpilicueta to a new deal but sanctions to club owner Roman Abramovich have put talks on hold. Silva, who joined Chelsea in 2020, told Mundo Deportivo: “Cesar Azpilicueta since I arrived, was one of my main sources of support. “There are players who have what it takes to be captain and he is one of them. He is a player who seeks union, who tries to help others. “He is a spectacular footballer and a super-professional who, with certainty, deserves to be where is. Azpilicueta has beastly conditions.”
