Following the scarcity of fuel and long queues witnessed at filling stations in Ondo State and the country at large, Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu stormed a filling station Monday evening to ensure compliance with the N165 approved pump price. Akeredolu visited Sunbeth Petrol Station, Oke-Aro, Idanre Road, Akure, the state capital, alongside the special Task Force Team mandated with ensuring the residents of the state gets the product with ease and at the approved pump price. After receiving a briefing from his Task Force team, the Governor took action following a report that the filling station had taken delivery of the product on Sunday night but refused to sell it to vehicles and motorbikes. Akeredolu, who frowned at the attitude of the filling station, promised that the people of the state would not be made to suffer unnecessarily in the face of scarcity. After touring the station and verifying the supply of petrol, Akeredolu directed that the fuel be sold to motorcycles and cars at the approved pump price of N165. Dr. Doyin Odebowale, the Head of the Governor’s Task Force and Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Special Duties, told the Governor that the petrol station owner indicated he would sell at N250 per liter instead of the N165 permitted pump price. The people, mostly commercial motorcyclists, hailed the Governor for rising to their aid. They particularly thanked the Governor for not allowing them to be exploited and subjected to undue hardship.
