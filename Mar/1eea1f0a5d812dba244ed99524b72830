Manchester United legend, Gary Neville, has described Ralf Rangick’s team selection and set-up as a ‘tactical show off’ as his team fell 4-1 to Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City side. Nevile believed that things got even worse when the German coach gave up on the failing system. Manchester United were beaten comfortably by their local rivals at the Etihad on Sunday, with goals from Kevin de Bruyne (2) and Riyad Mahrez (2) in each of the halves. Jadon Sancho had earlier pulled one back when he equalised De Bruyne’s first strike. However, things went out of control for the Red Devils after the break, with Riyad Mahrez scoring twice as Pep Guardiola’s men controlled the game entirely. Rangnick began the game with a front four of Anthony Elanga, Jadon Sancho, Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes, with Cristiano Ronaldo and Edinson Cavani absent from the squad. The former RB Leipzig boss started Pogba and Fernandes upfront in the major part of the game, which was a very unexpected line-up, and Neville felt this was just Rangnick “showing off.” Things got worse for United when the former Sports director reverted his formation to something more recognisable in the second half after he introduced Rashford and Jesse Lingard. “It felt to me like a tactical show off, in terms of trying to display a system,” Neville told Sky Sports. “That was how I viewed it as I sit here now. “But when he went to a more traditional system, putting Rashford on, Lingard to the right and Sancho to the left, that was worse!”
