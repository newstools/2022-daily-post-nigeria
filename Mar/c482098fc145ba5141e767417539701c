Paris Saint-Germain forward, Neymar, has identified Real Madrid’s Casemiro as the best defensive midfielder in the world. Neymar, a fellow country teammate with Casemiro, said this ahead of PSG’s Champions League round of 16 second-leg tie with Real Madrid on Wednesday night. Casemiro will miss the game due to suspension and Neymar believes his absence is a massive boost for PSG. “It won’t be easy [Real Madrid vs PSG game], Real Madrid have a lot of quality players. “For me, Casemiro is the best in the world in his position, but we are not thinking about that, we have to win the game the same way, we have to play as well as we can,” said Neymar as per Marca. Recall that PSG defeated Real Madrid 1-0 in the first-leg in France last month, thanks to Kylian Mbappe’s goal.
