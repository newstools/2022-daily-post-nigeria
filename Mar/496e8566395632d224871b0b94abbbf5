Nacho Monreal has claimed that his former Arsenal team-mate, Mesut Ozil, had “problems with everyone” while at the club. Ozil was released from his contract in January 2021 after falling out of favour under current manager Mikel Arteta. Monreal, now at Real Sociedad, joined the Gunners seven months before the German’s arrival in September 2013. The pair went on to play together for more than six years “Ozil’s problem is that he had problems with everyone,’ Monreal told FourFourTwo. “It ended badly with Wenger, he didn’t play the last few games with him, then Emery tried to bring him back and make him our leader. “To begin with, he gave him a lot of confidence and Mesut played a lot, but the coach understood there were other teammates who were in better condition. “Ozil was one of the best players in the team, one of the best paid, but they saw he wasn’t at the level required. “As a person, he was good with everyone, but he also missed a lot of games through injury.” Ozil, now 33, made 254 appearances for Arsenal in all competitions and now plays for Turkish club Fenerbache.
