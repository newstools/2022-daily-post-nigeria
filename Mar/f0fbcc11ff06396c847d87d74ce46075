Juventus have contacted Mino Raiola, who is the agent to Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba, over landing the player as a free agent this summer, Gazzetta dello Sport reports. Pogba’s contract at Old Trafford expires at the end of the season. The World Cup winner is widely expected to quit United for the second time in his career. Pogba previously made 178 appearances for Juventus during a four-year spell between 2012 and 2016. During that time, he won four Serie A titles and the Coppa Italia on two occasions and also helped the club to the 2015 Champions League final. The Serie A giants are ready to offer the 28-year-old a deal that would see him earn £6.2million-a-year. His wages could rise to as high as £8.3million-a-year if add-ons are taken into account. Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain are also monitoring Pogba’s situation in England.
