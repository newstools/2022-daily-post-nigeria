A former Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, Victor Umeh, has disclosed why Bianca Ojukwu slapped Ebelechukwu, wife of Willie Obiano, ex-Anambra State governor. Umeh disclosed that Ebelechukwu verbally attacked Bianca, the wife of late Odumegu-Ojukwu, during the inauguration of Charles Soludo as Governor of Anambra State. Speaking with Arise TV, Umeh narrated that the verbal attack led to a scuffle between both women. Umeh disclosed that he had to separate Bianca and the former First Lady to prevent the scuffle from escalating during the event. On Thursday, a video had surfaced online of Bianca in a fight with the immediate past First Lady. The scuffle occurred during the swearing-in ceremony of Soludo in Awka yesterday. Reacting to the incident, Umeh said he had to intervene to prevent Bianca from being harmed. He said: “From Ambassador Bianca’s narrative, she was correct in her narration of what actually happened because we were all seated in good time for the event. “The video footage has shown everything to everybody that she left where she was sitting and walked straight to where Ambassador Bianca was sitting calmly and started verbal attacks on her. I was seated away but within a very clear view. “When the exchange of blows, as I would call it started, I had to rush to that place to restrain them and separate them to ensure that no harm was inflicted on Ambassador Bianca Ojukwu who was seated very calmly for that ceremony.”
