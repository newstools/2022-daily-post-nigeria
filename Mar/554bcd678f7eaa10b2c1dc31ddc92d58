Paris Saint-Germain forward, Kylian Mbappe, has broken his silence on his side’s elimination from the Champion League. Mbappe, in a tweet via his Instagram account on Thursday evening, stressed his sadness after PSG’s Champions League defeat to Real Madrid. The 23-year-old’s goal was not enough as Real Madrid defeated PSG 3-1 in the Champions League round of 16 second-leg tie at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday. Mbappe scored the first goal during the encounter but Karim Benzema’s hat-trick ensured Real Madrid sent PSG packing from the Champions League. Reacting, Mbappe wrote: “Difficult moment. The Champions League was a big objective for us, but we failed. “The season isn’t over and whatever happens to us we will remain united & determined until the last game of the season. “Thanks to the fans who supported us and made the trip. “ICI C’EST PARIS.”
