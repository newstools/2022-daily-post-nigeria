Cristiano Ronaldo’s sister, Katia Aveiro, seemed to agree the Manchester United forward did not miss the 4-1 defeat to Manchester City on Sunday with injury. The 37-year-old was not part of Ralf Rangnick’s squad for the Derby, with the interim boss claiming the player was injured in training. A post from a Ronaldo fan account posted before the clash read: “Cristiano Ronaldo is not injured and is not sick. The man is 100%. “Good morning to you who, like me, are sad and angry because Rangnick decided to ruin our Sunday by taking CR7 out of the derby against Manchester City simply for tactical reasons, to defend himself more in the game.” The post was subsequently liked by Katia, in what could be considered a nod towards a superstar performer being omitted for other reasons, according to Goal.
