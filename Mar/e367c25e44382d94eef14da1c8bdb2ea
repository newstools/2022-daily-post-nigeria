The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC has come under scrutiny over its alleged failure to arrest former Governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. Reno Omokri, a former presidential aide, wondered why Tinubu has been allowed to move freely despite alleged corruption cases against him while Willie Obiano, who just finished his eight years tenure as the Governor of Anambra State on Thursday was arrested immediately As DAILY POST reported, Obiano was arrested at the Lagos International Airport on Thursday a few hours after he officially handed over to Prof. Charles Soludo and was heading out of the country. Speaking with BBC Pidgin, the Public Relations Officer of EFCC Wilson Uwajaren, said Obiano had been on the watchlist of the Commission prior to the transition on Thursday. And Omokri is surprised that the EFCC is not after Tinubu, who served as Lagos State Governor for eight years. “Compared to Bola Tinubu, Obiano is a saint. Compared to Oluremi Tinubu, Ebele is a choir mistress,” the former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan tweeted. “Why has EFCC left Bola Tinubu, with his humongous corruption, and gone after Obiano? “Nigerians let us not allow ourselves be distracted by this drama! We need equity!”
