Mai Buni, Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker Committee has denied renewed rift among the governors on the party’s platform. The Yobe Governor said since the directive for peace by President Muhammadu Buhari, all have been on good terms. A statement on Wednesday by his spokesman, Mamman Mohammed accused some persons of trying to set the chieftains against each other. The aim is to “ignite an unsolicited crisis, just a few days to the party’s national convention”, Buni noted. Mohammed said since the intervention of the presidency and the caution against media war, backstabbing and name-calling, the governors have been united. “It is irrational, absurd and irresponsible for anyone to at this moment initiate animosity and resentment among the stakeholders. “Upon his return and assumption of office as Chairman of the party, Governor Buni described the incident as a past event and there is no Victor, No Vanquished. “He commended his colleagues on the Caretaker Committee for the great job they have done under the acting chairmanship of Niger State Governor, Abubakar Sani Bello,” he said. Buni said governors and other stalwarts were heading various sub-committees of the convention and have been meeting with him to ensure a successful convention. According to him, it would amount to irresponsibility for anyone to push forward injurious opinions in complete disregard to the directive from the President. The APC vowed not to condone disrespect to the President and any attempt to “deliberately cause confusion and divert attention from the cause of having a fruitful convention”.
