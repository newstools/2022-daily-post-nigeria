The Adamawa State Command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has paraded six suspected Kidnappers. The suspects, including one said to have been jailed thrice, were said to have been terrorising people in Mubi, Hong and Gombi Local Government Areas in the northern part of the state. The state Corps Commander, Muhammed Maksha, who paraded the suspects on Tuesday in Yola, named them as Muhammed Umar, 40; Abubakar Jabbi, 25; Usman Abubakar, 28; Abdullahi Dogo, 25; Suleiman Maman, 22 and Umaru Umaru, 19. He said the suspects were arrested by Nigerian Army and Operation Hadin Kai officials and handed over to the state command for appropriate action. “They were arrested with sophisticated weapons and they have made useful confessional statements,” he said, adding that after due investigation, they will be charged to court for trial. Emphasising that one of the suspects has been confirmed to have been jailed three times, the NSCDC Commander said his command would ensure that the particular suspect gets properly prosecuted this time.
