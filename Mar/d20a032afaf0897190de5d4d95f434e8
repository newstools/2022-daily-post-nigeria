Late Prophet TB Joshua of the Synagogue Church of All Nation SCOAN had predicted the war currently going between Ukraine and the Russian forces. TB Joshua, who died on June 6, 2021, had in about eight years ago, asked the world to pray for Russia and Ukraine for God to avert the war he said was coming upon the countries. In an old video reposted on YouTube by his disciples, the late prophet was sighted saying nations would stand against Russia during the crisis, stressing that a powerful Russian who represent the country’s authority would be killed if prayers are not offered. According to the video, the prophet said, “Great war is coming against them (Russia). I don’t know where the war is coming from. “So pray for them because their leader will face greater opposition and the opposition will be so much that it may exclude sin. And that will turn the nation to another thing”. “Who could be bigger than the person killed in Russia? I’m speaking in parable. Pray for the authority there. Pray for the president of Russia. “Pray for the nation Ukraine and Russia for the whole things that are happening there. Pray for them for unity and peace”. DAILY POST reports that Russian forces invaded major cities of Ukraine on February 24, killing several people as major infrastructures are being destroyed continuously. Despite economic sanctions from some powerful nations like the United States of America, USA, the Russian forces has refused to heed calls for ceasefire.
