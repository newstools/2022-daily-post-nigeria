The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has eulogised former President, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, on his 85th birthday. The party, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Hon. Debo Ologunagba, on Saturday described Obasanjo as an exceptionally patriotic leader, courageous statesman, insightful administrator and global personality. It also commended the former President for his pivotal roles towards the security, unity, stability and development of Nigeria, Africa and the world at large. According to the party, “as a military leader, democratically elected President and now an elder statesman, Chief Obasanjo remains a detribalized leader and firm believer in one and indivisible Nigeria established on the firm foundation of democracy, justice, equity, transparency and the Rule of Law.” It stressed that Obasanjo’s leading role as military Head of State effectively steered the ship of state and returned the nation to democratic rule in 1979. It also stated that “as a democratically-elected President, under the platform of our great party, the PDP, Chief Obasanjo ran an all-inclusive, transparent and development-oriented government, entrenched democratic practice, revamped the productive sectors, set up anti-corruption institutions and steadied the nation on the path of economic prosperity in line with the vision and manifesto of the PDP. “Under the Obasanjo-led PDP administration, our nation paid off our foreign debt, instilled good governance to effectively empower Nigerians and stimulate rapid growth in critical sectors including agriculture, manufacturing, education, power, oil and gas, healthcare, housing, banking and finance, telecommunication among others, and made our nation a global investment destination,” it added. The PDP prayed to God to grant him more years in good health for greater service to the nation and humanity at large.
