The ruling APC in Cross River State has accused the PDP of electoral crimes during last weekend’s Akpabuyo state constituency by-election and is set to take complaints to Election Petition Tribunal. In a statement by its publicity Secretary, Erasmus Ekpang, APC claimed that they won the by-election and not PDP. The ruling party has therefore rejected the result declared by INEC which showed that PDP won it. In the same vein, a day before the PDP which lost the Ogoja-Yala federal constituency by-election last weekend had claimed that they won and not APC, citing alleged electoral crimes captured on video. Ekpang said: “All Progressives Congress, APC has after a detailed review of the Akpabuyo State Constituency election discovered the mind-boggling malpractice and electoral fraud perpetrated by the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. “We reject in its entirety the outcome of the February 26th, 2022 Akpabuyo State Constituency election. “The result as declared by INEC was not a true reflection of the actual voting. “The APC will not allow declaration of the PDP candidate as the winner of the election to stand.” APC claimed that there was brazen manipulation and distortion of figures by the PDP. APC said they will proceed to the Tribunal to reclaim their victory won by their candidate, Bassey Ekpo.
