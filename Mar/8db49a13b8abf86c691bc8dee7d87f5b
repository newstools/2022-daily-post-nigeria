Lagos State House of Assembly says All Progressives Congress (APC) leader, Bola Ahmed Tinubu helped the legislature attain financial autonomy. The Speaker, Mudashiru Obasa and members said they achieved independence years before the mass clamour for it by other Houses of Assembly. The lawmakers praised the former Lagos Governor at a special plenary session to commemorate his 70th birthday. Obasa described Tinubu as a benefactor, adding that the presidential aspirant had done well as a leader. “He resolved and insisted on being in the opposition against the Federal Government. “This House has been running independently of the executive arm with financial autonomy through the help of Asiwaju. As governor, he increased the IGR”, Obasa said. The Speaker maintained it was always good to celebrate people that have contributed immensely to the development of society. Deputy Speaker, Wasiu Eshilokun-Sanni stressed that Tinubu had done a lot for democracy since he entered politics. Eshilokun-Sanni said it was easy for him to join the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) but he remained focused on building a progressive party. “We call on him to continue his ambition to become the President of Nigeria,” he added. Gbolahan Yishawu, who represents Eti-Osa 2, described Tinubu as a man with a large heart and one who easily forgives. Victor Akande, who represents Ojo 1, told Tinubu’s critics threatening to leave the country if he becomes president to start gathering their things. The lawmaker added that the APC co-founder will become Nigeria’s leader after the 2023 elections.
