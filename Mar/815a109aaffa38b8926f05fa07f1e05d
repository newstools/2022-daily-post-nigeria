The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has received another batch of Nigerian returnees from Libya. Director-General, Mustapha Habib told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday that 128 persons returned via the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) in Lagos. He said they left Mitiga International Airport in Tripoli, Tuesday night, aboard a chartered Buraq Boeing 100-800 aircraft with registration 5A-DMG. Habib, represented by the Acting Coordinator, Lagos Territorial Office, Ibrahim Farinloye, disclosed that 90 are males and 38 females. “They had left the country to seek greener pastures in various European countries but could not afford to return when their journey became frustrated”, Habib said. The DG advised the returnees and others to look beyond seeking better livelihood outside Nigeria. He assured them that the Federal Government would provide an enabling environment where citizens would prosper. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) assisted in the voluntary repatriation programme for those in distress.
