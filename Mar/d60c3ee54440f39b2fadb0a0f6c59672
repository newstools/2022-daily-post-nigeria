Former Manchester United midfielder, Owen Hargreaves has named Manchester City and Liverpool as the best two teams in Europe. Hargreaves said this while giving his verdict on this season’s Premier League title race between Liverpool and Manchester City. Man City looked like running away with the Premier League title this season, having held a 12-point lead over Jurgen Klopp’s men two months ago. But Liverpool have picked up the pace on Pep Guardiola’s side and now sit just a point behind the Citizens, with both having played 29 games. “I am amazed Liverpool have made this a title race. Two months ago, you would have thought it was over. Liverpool are just such a great team, obviously Virgil van Dijk back, defensively they are sound,” Hargreaves told Football Talk. He added: “Depth – I think that was the only issue for Liverpool they didn’t have enough depth. And all of a sudden now with Diaz going to that side, Jota, they are great. “Problem is City are probably one of the greatest teams we’ve seen. I think they are by far the best two teams in Europe. This is going to go right down to the wire. I really feel that.”
