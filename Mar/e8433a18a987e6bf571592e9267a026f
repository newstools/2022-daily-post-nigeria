Sani Musa, a National Chairman aspirant of the APC, has said he will stop the practice of governors funding the APC when elected. Musa, a member of the current senate, while speaking with members of the APC House Caucus on Tuesday, said the party will leverage on the 43 million registered members of the APC. He disclosed that he will be approaching network providers to ensure a monthly contribution of the members. “I don’t see where the Democratic Party of the USA begs governors to fund the party. When elected, I don’t see any reason why the party, with 43 million members should be going to governors for money,” he stated. This could be a direct challenge to the governors of the APC, who continue to control the party after the exit of Adams Oshiomhole. Although, it is believed that the President had adopted Sen Adamu Abdulahi as the National Chairman but other candidates continue to campaign.
