Napoli striker, Victor Osimhen, scored twice as they came from behind to beat Udinese 2-1 on Saturday. The win moves them level on points with Serie A leaders AC Milan. Gerard Deulofeu opened the scoring in the 22nd minute before Osimehn grabbed a brace to turn the game around. His first was a bullet header to level the match seven minutes after the break, before a clever near-post finish 11 minutes later completed the turnaround. Napoli have now recorded back-to-back league wins for the first time since late January into early February. Osimhen is now off to Nigeria, where he will join the Super Eagles squad for their crucial 2022 World Cup playoffs against Ghana. The first leg will be played in Kumasi on March 25, with the reverse leg four days later in Abuja.
