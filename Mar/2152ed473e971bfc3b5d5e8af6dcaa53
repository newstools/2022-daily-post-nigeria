Former Super Eagles forward, Victor Ikpeba has given his verdict on Nigeria’s squad list to face the Black Stars of Ghana in a World Cup playoff later this month. Last week, Super Eagles interim coach, Austine Eguavoen released the names of those invited for the two-legged games and placed seven others on standby. Ademola Lookman and Akinkunmi Amoo, who got a maiden call-up, and long term injury absentee, Oghenekaro Etebo all made the cut. Ogenyi Onazi, who has not played for Nigeria in almost over two years, was named on the standby list. But Ikpeba believes that qualification to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar should be paramount, adding that Eguavoen has a selection headache. “We are not the coaches. They must have seen Onazi doing something,” Ikpeba said on SuperSport’s Monday Night Football. “What we want to do is see them go out and defeat Ghana and qualify for the World Cup. We should not dwell on the list. “Egu has a selection headache. We don’t know if Chukwueze or Moses will start because we have lots of forwards. “Integration is important. You need time to gel. “Europe is different because you play together regularly. Eguavoen has a lot of work cut out. It does not matter who starts,” Ikpeba added.
