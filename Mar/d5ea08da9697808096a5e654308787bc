The Peoples Democratic Party in Cross River State has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to never assign its national electoral commissioner, Mr Festu Okoye to Cross River State for election duties. The PDP alleged that Okoye is a wolf in sheepskin and that he works for the ruling APC government in the state. PDP claimed that in the 2020 Cross River North senatorial by-election, Okoye openly worked for the success of the ruling APC. At a news conference in Calabar, Chairman of the PDP, Venatius Ikem again demanded that Okoye be investigated and stopped from coming to the state to perpetuate his acts. The party further claimed that the acclaimed victory of the APC at last weekend’s by-election was fraughted with violence, ballot snatching and gun intimidation and therefore rejected the result. “We demand that Mr. Festus Okoye be investigated and never again posted for election duty to Cross River State because he has shown clearly that he comes here at the behest of Governor Ayade, to do his dirty work of subverting the will of the electorate in the state.” PDP also demanded that INEC produce all BVAS machines used for the election to ascertain if the accreditation recorded in the machines corresponds with the number of votes declared by the Returning officer in the February 26 by-election. “We demand that the INEC investigates her staff, especially one Mr. Toyin an assistant director or deputy director in the Commission’s office in Calabar in charge of the IT unit to unravel his interference with the BVAS machines deployed for the election in which he claimed that five units were missing before the election which is alleged to have suddenly emerged at election centres.” Ikem said the PDP was proceeding to the tribunal and will do so to claim their victory, adding that it has assorted evidence to prove that it won the by-election. He also challenged the ruling APC to prove the PDP wrong with its own evidence.
