No player or coach from the Nigeria squad spoke to reporters after they failed to qualify for the 2022 World Cup on Tuesday. The Super Eagles needed an outright win at the Moshood Abiola Stadium in Abuja to book their place at the tournament, following a goalless draw in Kumasi. However, they could only draw 1-1 in front of their home fans, with William Troost-Ekong’s penalty cancelling out Thomas Partey’s opener. Angry supporters stormed the pitch to attack Ghanaian fans and players, destroying equipment and properties, as they showed their frustration in protest. There was also no appearance by any player or even the head coach, Augustine Eguavoen, in the post-match press conference. The team bus also did not leave the stadium almost two hours after the game ended.
