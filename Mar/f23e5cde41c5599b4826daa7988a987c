The All Progressives Congress, APC, Ebonyi State chapter has reacted to the ruling of an Abuja Federal High Court sacking Governor Dave Umahi from office. Justice Inyang Ekwo of an Abuja Federal High Court on Tuesday sacked Governor Umahi and his Deputy, Dr. Kelechi Igwe from office over their unlawful defection from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Justice Ekwo ordered Umahi and his Deputy to vacate their offices immediately saying their defection was unlawful, unconstitutional, null, and void. Ekwo held that the vote which brought the governor and his Deputy into office belonged to the PDP and that they cannot hold onto the votes having elected to jettison the party that nominated them. Mr Simbad Chidi, Publicity Secretary of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Ebonyi, reacting, described the sack by the court as a “disturbance to democracy” in the state. “Today’s ruling in Abuja cannot overrule the State High Court that upheld his defection to APC already. The ruling is unacceptable,” Chidi told NAN.
