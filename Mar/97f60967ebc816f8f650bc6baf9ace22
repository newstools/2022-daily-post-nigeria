No fewer than five men have been arrested by the police for allegedly snatching a car in Iperu, Ikenne Local Government Area of Ogun State. Police said the suspects belong to a robbery gang terrorizing Iperu, Sagamu and Ode Remo axis of Ogun State. The men, namely Moruf Abidogun, Afees Adesina, Fisayo Aliu, Usman Adeyemi and Dauda Lekan were arrested following a distress call received by the DPO of Iperu division, SP Waheed Oni. SP Oni had been told that the hoodlums were sighted along Ogere road, dispossessing people of their belongings. Upon the distress call, the DPO was said to have quickly mobilised his men, in collaboration with the Area Command’s anti-robbery team in Sagamu and men of the Ogere patrol team to the scene. “On sighting the policemen, the hoodlums who have already snatched a Toyota Corolla car with registration number, GGE 733 FL, took to their heels, but they were hotly chased by the policemen and five of them were apprehended,” the Ogun State police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said on Monday. According to Oyeyemi, a preliminary investigation has revealed that the gang has its base in Lagos State but members usually visit Iperu to rob, because one of them resides in the town. DAILY POST learnt that a locally-made pistol and the stolen Toyota Corolla car were recovered from the suspects. The Commissioner of Police in Ogun, Lanre Bankole, has ordered the immediate transfer of the suspects to the State CIID for discreet investigation.
