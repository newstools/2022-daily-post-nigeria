The Rivers State Government has confirmed the arrival of a vessel containing petrol at the Port Harcourt depot. This is coming amid continued scarcity of petrol across the state. The state Commissioner for Energy and Natural Resources, Doctor Peter Medee, who gave the confirmation in an interview with newsmen, said the vessel contains enough petrol that will serve Rivers people and end the current fuel scarcity in the state. The commissioner called on the general public to avoid panic buying. He said, “I’m glad to announce today that we received a report that the vessel we have been waiting for has arrived at the Port Harcourt depot. “In a matter of days and hours, they will begin to load. “So, my advice to Rivers people is that they should avoid panic buying.” The Commissioner further called on petroleum marketers to sell at the government-approved price to enable them sell out old products before the arrival of new products. As of Thursday evening, queues have continued to build up in some filling stations that are dispensing petrol. Some of them continue to sell between N180 and N200 per litre.
