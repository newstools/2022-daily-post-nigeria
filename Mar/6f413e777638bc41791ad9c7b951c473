Former Bayern Munich defender, Sammy Kuffour, has chided former Black Stars’ striker, Asamoah Gyan, over his ‘nonsense’ comments after Ghana national team’s squad was released. Gyan had criticized the national team’s list for the 2022 FIFA World Cup playoff against Nigeria on Friday. The former Sunderland attacker had on Tuesday used the word ‘nonsense’ after Anderlecht midfielder, Majeed Ashimeru, was not included in Ghana’s squad that was announced to face the Super Eagles. Gyan eventually apologized for his comments, insisting that he was carried away by emotions but Kuffour has now faulted Gyan’s decision to criticize the squad list on social media. “I think he has his personal views on certain players. I personally have to respect his decision as a human being, but putting that aside, we also have to go to the coaches, they have monitored every player, but when you look at the statistics, how many matches has Majeed Ashimeru played,” Kuffour told Kessben FM. “I believe Asamoah Gyan is part of Ghana, he has captained the team and the little advice I have for him is that, if something like this happens, maybe he can call one or two people, but if you put on social media to use nonsense, I don’t think it’s fair.”
