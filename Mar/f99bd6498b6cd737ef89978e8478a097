The Leader Of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, on Sunday, called for the resignation of President Muhammadu Buhari as the Minister of Petroleum. Primate Ayodele made the call in reaction to the ongoing fuel scarcity across the country. In a statement by his media aide, Primate Ayodele said Buhari was not capable of handling the portfolio, especially at a critical period like this. He noted that the President should honourably resign from the position and hand over to someone who knows the nooks and crannies of Nigeria’s petroleum system. According to Ayodele: “President Buhari should resign as minister of petroleum and hand over to someone who is capable of managing this crisis. “This is not a thing to joke with. The economy is biting hard already, we need someone capable, Buhari isn’t capable to be the minister of petroleum. We need the right person who knows everything about our petroleum system.” Nigerians have been battling with fuel scarcity since February. The return of long queues at filling stations were linked to adulterated fuel that was circulated. However, the Federal Government had assured that normalcy would soon be restored across the country.
