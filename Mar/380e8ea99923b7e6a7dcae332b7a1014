Napoli will only allow Victor Osimhen to join Manchester United or Newcastle United next summer for €100 million. Without that, the Serie A leaders will not allow their Nigerian import join the Premier League sides or Real Madrid in June, according to The Sun, UK. The Super Eagles attacker is currently being linked with a move to either Manchester United or Newcastle United, with Real Madrid also said to be showing interest. Napoli President, Aurelio De Laurentiis according to the report, is not thinking of selling Osimhen in the summer. But he would be attempted to do so if any of the Interested sides offer a monster bid. Napoli signed the Nigeria international for 70 million euros from French Ligue1 side Lille in the summer of 2020. And the Italians want the Nigerian to spend at least one more season in Serie A before thinking about letting him go.
