An activist, Deji Adeyanju has advocated that the next Nigerian president should rather come from the northern part of Nigeria instead of the South West. DAILY POST reports that there have been agitations for power rotation from the North to the South after President Muhammadu Buhari completes his tenure in 2023. For that reason, the All Progressives Congress (APC) has decided to pick its presidential candidate from the South. The southern part of Nigeria comprises the South West, South South and South East. In a post early on Friday, Adeyanju opined that the South West should not produce the next president if truly power should go to the south. According to him, the South West was in power for eight years and also has another opportunity as the Vice President for another eight years. While saying that the current democracy does not belong to the South West, Adeyanju maintained that those clamouring for power to go to the South West were worse than those asking that power should stay in the North. He described them as being tribalistic and selfish. His words: “It is better for power to remain in the North than for power to go to the South West for another 8 years. It will be manifestly unjust for power to go to the South West again after they got 8 years as president and another 8 years as VP. “This democracy does not belong to the South West. Those clamoring for power to go to the South and pushing for South West are worse than those asking power to stay in the North. These people are not interested in equity but tribalism and selfish interest.”
