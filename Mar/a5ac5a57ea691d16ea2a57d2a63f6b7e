Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, will this weekend declarare for a second term at the national convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja A prominent member of the Governors Advisory Council (GAC), who is also one of the apex leaders of APC in Lagos state, told DAILY POST on Sunday that Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, former Lagos State Governors and APC national leader has okayed Sanwo-Olu’s second term. The source, who did not want his name mentioned, said Tinubu had instructed the party leaders to work for his re-election. “Sanwo-Olu is coming back. I can authoritatively confirm that to you. He is likely to declare and will kick off his re-election campaign this weekend at Eagles Square, the venue of the national convention of the APC on March 26 in Abuja. “The governor has performed creditably well in all areas since coming to office in 2019. As a technocrat, he focused on his job as governor and allowed political leaders who ensured his emergence to run the political affairs of the state. This endeared him to many of us and we believe he should be allowed to continue the good works he started,” he said. Recall that Tinubu had thwarted the chance of former Lagos State Governor, Akinwumi Ambode to contest for a second term in 2019.
