Former Nigeria International, Daniel Amokachi, has hailed three Super Eagles stars, Victor Osimhen, Emmanuel Dennis and Ademola Lookman, as the players who contributed to Nigeria earning a penalty in their 2022 FIFA World Cup second playoff 1-1 draw against the Black Stars of Ghana at the MKO Abiola Stadium on Tuesday. Recall that Ghana defeated Nigeria on away goal after the match ended 1-1, thanks to Thomas Partey’s strike. William Troost-Ekong did score a penalty for the Super Eagles. The first leg ended in a 0-0 draw in Kumasi last Friday. “Now you have Lookman getting the ball from the side, you have Dennis bulldozing from the side when he has the ball, he does what he wants. You have Osimhen taking the ball behind the defensive line,” Amokachi said on SuperSport. “I think that contributed towards the penalty that you were just talking about.” He added, “Definitely not me. We have a lot of crowd in the green room who were shouting, ‘why is he?’. I know he has kicked a couple of penalties by himself and he scored. “For him to stand up in a key game like this, the leadership that he possesses even if the goalkeeper dived towards the ball, the ball was a bit hard.” —
