The Imo State House of Assembly, IMHA, will resume proceedings tomorrow (Tuesday ) after a power outage forced it to suspend sitting last Thursday. The House was in full session, when around 12:15 pm, the public power supply from the Enugu Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC) went off, throwing the entire assembly complex into darkness. Power was “flashed” around 12:30 pm, but was taken back till the time of adjournment, owing to poor illumination and ventilation in the hallowed chamber, which led to the doors and windows being kept ajar, it could not ameliorate the situation. Owing to the uncomfortable situation, which arose from the poor illumination and ventilation of the hallowed chamber, the Speaker, Rt. Hon. Kennedy Ibeh, was forced to adjourn to Tuesday, March 8, 2022. The continued outage of power also caused the public address system including microphones and the camera in the chamber to malfunction for minutes which forced the House to adjourn. DAILY POST gathered that the generating set, that provides alternative source of power broke down and the necessary repairs to put it in good working condition have not been effected as at Thursday, last week.
