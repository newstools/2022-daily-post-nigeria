Emmanuel Appiah, a Ghana Football Association official, has backed the Black Stars of Ghana to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar later this year ahead of Nigeria. Ghana will host Nigeria in a 2022 FIFA World Cup playoff on Friday at the Baba Yara Sports Stadium in Kumasi. The Super Eagles will then host Ghana in the second leg in Abuja on Tuesday. But Appiah believes the Black Stars have everything in place to beat Nigeria. “All I can say is that the whole of Ghana is ready for Friday’s game to start with, before talking about the return leg in Abuja next week Tuesday, and we are eager to reach the World Cup once again,” Appia told Complete Sports. “You know it’s been quite long since we played in a World Cup, that was at the Brazil 2014 tournament, but we want to be in Qatar this year. We believe we can do it and everything is in place to get there,” he added.
