Justice O. O. Abike-Fadipe of a Special Offences Court in Ikeja, Lagos, has convicted Aliu Tijani for internet fraud. Tijani was arraigned in December 2021 by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on a one-count amended charge. He was charged with possession of documents, containing false pretence, which he used to perpetrate a love scam. After pleading “not guilty” initially, Tijani made a u-turn and sought a plea bargain, necessitating his re-arraignment. Prosecuting counsel, C. M. Uzodinma, informed the court of the agreement between both parties. Uzodinma recalled that Tijani was arrested in September 2021 by EFCC operatives following intelligence. “He was interrogated, and he volunteered his statement,” the lawyer said. Tijani’s statement and fraudulent documents printed from his iPhone were admitted in evidence and marked Exhibit P1 and P2. Justice Abike-Fadipe sentenced him to one year in prison with an option of fine of N500,000 and 40 hours of community service. The iPhone and $1,500 recovered from him were ordered forfeited to the Federal Government. Tijani must also sign an undertaking with the EFCC upon his release to never again engage in financial crimes.
