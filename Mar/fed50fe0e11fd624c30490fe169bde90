Kaduna Central Senator, Uba Sani, has described alleged moves against his 2023 ambition as a display of cowardice. The lawmaker announced his intention to succeed Governor Nasir El-Rufai last week. After his declaration, “Concerned PDP Members, Kaduna State” petitioned the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). They alleged Sani has been using public money for politics and that the mobilization of his constituents to access the CBN/NIRSAL COVID-19 funds was a ploy to influence party delegates. In a statement on Friday, Rabiu Abubakar, Sani’s Chief Constituency Officer said they were not surprised by the “desperation”. The aide noted that since his principal entry into the governorship race, “entrenched political forces” have become jittery and resorted to blackmail. Abubakar said they had been “concocting lies and unnecessary heating up of the Kaduna State political landscape”. Insisting the petition “reeks of crass ignorance”, he explained that majority of the beneficiaries were rural farmers, traders and artisans and market women. “Out of these 10,000 beneficiaries, just about 500 are party delegates. This proves that the aim was not political patronage but to mobilize people in need to access the funds. “Some elements cannot live with the fact that a first time Senator has broken new grounds and has surpassed all expectations. They are applying foul means to try to stop the momentum.” Sani told his opponents that he is interested in issues-based politicking, not character assassination and lies. The Senator declared his readiness to join issues with anybody “based on facts and sound arguments”. The statement stressed that “the use of proxies or hatchet men to fight political battles is an act of cowardice”.
