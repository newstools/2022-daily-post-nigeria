Former Aston Villa star, Gabriel Agbonlahor has insisted that age has finally caught up with Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo. Agbonlahor said that Ronaldo’s legs look tired, adding that the 37-year-old is not offering much upfront and does not need to start every Man United game. Ronaldo remains Man United’s top scorer across all competitions so far this season, having rejoined the club from Juventus in the summer of 2021. “For a lot of Man United fans, it will be painful watching Ronaldo at the moment. He’s 37; he’s outdone most footballers by five or six years, but you can’t hide from ageing. Age catches up with everyone, and it looks like it has caught up with Ronaldo,” Agbonlahor told Football Insider. “His legs look tired; he doesn’t look as quick and sharp getting round players. He’s also not a presser from the front either. With all those things, it doesn’t make sense for him to keep starting,” he said. He added: “But who else have they got? They have not got many other options there. Unless they play Rashford as a striker or a false nine. “It’s a big worry for Man United if they have Ronaldo and Cavani as the options up there for next season.”
