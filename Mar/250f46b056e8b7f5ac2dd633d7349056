Lagos Police Rapid Response Squad (RRS) has arrested 22-year-old Rilwan Sodiq for traffic robbery. Rilwan was released from the Kirikiri Correctional Centre in December 2021, the police said in a statement. This time, he was caught at Ojota after snatching a Samsung Galaxy Note 9 from a lady driving Toyota Sienna. Her screams got the attention of officers who, alongside good samaritans, chased Rilwan and nabbed him near Abiola Garden. “The phone was recovered from his pant after denying he had stolen something”, RRS noted. Rilwan, whose left arm got fractured after leaving prison, worked with an accomplice identified as Sodiq. The ex-convict disclosed that Sodiq distracted the victim while he slipped his hand through the passenger’s side of the car. Rilwan confessed he earlier dispossessed three motorists of their phones using the same method. He is in police custody.
