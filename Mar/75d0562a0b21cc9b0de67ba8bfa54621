Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, former governor of Kano State, has said his defection to the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP) from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was historic and opened a new chapter in the political life of Nigeria. He assured that it is only NNPP that has what it takes to take Nigeria to the promised land. Kwankwaso, a former presidential aspirant on the platform of PDP in the 2019 general elections, received his NNPP membership card from his ward chairman in Abuja. He enjoined other well-meaning Nigerians to join his new party to attain the change Nigeria needs in the midst of the present security challenges. According to him, both the PDP and the All Progressives Congress (APC) have failed Nigerians, saying that there should be a good alternative in 2023 which is the NNPP. He explained, “We had a situation in April last year where zonal positions were being shared among the states and all leaders in the six other states were given the opportunity to nominate. But in Kano, some people felt I wasn’t that important so they had to do what they did.” Kwankwaso stated that that is what triggered his defection, stressing that he spent almost a year expecting the PDP to open talks with him. He added that for that reason, he felt there are irreconcilable differences between his humble self and many other leaders and they are mainly based on ideology. He said that he has just received his membership card, expressing delight. DAILY POST recalls that Kwankwaso had written to his PDP ward chairman to announce his exit from the party.
