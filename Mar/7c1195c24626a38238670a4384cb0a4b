The Kogi State Command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), has threatened to arrest any petroleum marketer selling petrol above approved pump price of N162 to N165 per litre. DAILY POST had earlier reported that, a litre of fuel in Kogi State now sells between N250 to N500 at filling stations and black market respectively. Speaking during an interview with DAILY POST on Wednesday, the Kogi State Commandant of NSCDC Suleiman Mafara said the command was aware of some sharp practices of petroleum marketers who are hoarding fuel or selling above the approved pump price. He said no individual or group of persons is above the law, adding that any attempt to incapacitate the effort of the government will not be entertained. According to him, “The command has received intelligent reports that some marketers are hoarding fuel and selling it to black marketers in the night for their own selfish gains. NSCDC under my watch will not allow this to happen. “We are working tirelessly to ensure that this ill-practice such as hoarding of petroleum products, diversion and selling above pump price is controlled. “We have re-strategized and updated our plans by commencing night operations. By God’s grace, the situation will be put under control. On our part, we will continue to operate within the scope of our mandate. “NSCDC won’t fold its arms and allow some group of individuals to sabotage the effort of the government to bring back normalcy to the downstream sector. Anybody found wanting, irrespective of how they are highly placed will be treated in accordance with the law of the land.” He admonished the public to avail to command information on any sharp practices coming from petroleum marketers in Kogi State.
