Roma boss, Jose Mourinho disagreed that Tammy Abraham was fantastic during their 3-0 win over Lazio on Sunday, despite the England striker scoring two of those goals. Mourinho told his post match interviewers, “When you say Abraham is fantastic, I disagree,” adding that he expects more from the former Chelsea star. In his first season in Italy, Abraham has scored 23 goals in all competitions already, but his Portuguese manager wants to see more from him. Mourinho believes Abraham can do even more, because he has that much potential. “When you say Abraham is fantastic I disagree, he can do even more. I demand a lot from him because I know his potential, I’m not talking about goals but he must play every game with this attitude,” Mourinho told DAZN after the 3-0 win at the Stadio Olimpico. Abraham’s remarkable season is put into context by the fact that he made Roma history with his brace on Sunday. Gabriel Batistuta and Voncenzo Montella shared the club record for most goals in a debut season with 21, but now the England international has moved past them and onto 23.
