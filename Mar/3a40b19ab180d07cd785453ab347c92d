The Senator representing Ikot Ekpene Senatorial District, Akwa Ibom North West and former Deputy Governor of Akwa Ibom state, Christopher Ekpenyong, has announced that God has also revealed to him that Senator Bassey Akpan will be the governor of the state This was in contrast to Governor Udom Emmanuel’s earlier claim that God had revealed Pastor Umo Eno as his would-be successor in 2023. But Ekpenyong, who is one of the chieftains of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in the state, during a consultative visit on him over the weekend by Senator Akpan, dismissed the Governor Emmanuel’s vision, saying instead, his colleague in the Red Chamber, Senator Akpan, has been revealed to him by God, as the next Akwa Ibom governor. Addressing a crowd of supporters, who accompanied the Senator to the private consultative visit, Ekpenyong said: “I don’t know what others are saying and what they heard. All I know is that God has told me that Obong Bassey Albert Akpan, is the best governorship aspirant for Akwa Ibom at this time. OBA has the experience, he has the connection. With him, we can go to bed and sleep”. Ekpenyong, who said “nobody can intimidate me to accept what is not good for the people”, insisted that the people want a governor who knows their peculiar problems and has the wide contacts to deploy for their solutions saying that within the period they have worked together in the red chamber, “you have been a pride to Akwa Ibom and Nigeria.” “Since your heart is very clear, I know that you will change the circumstances of these men and women. As a former banker, you know that these people need welfare and banking investments. What they need is development. If you go to Ini, you can change the environment into a rice belt so we can also have a rice pyramid. From Obot Akara to Etim Ekpo to Ika, we have the best palm oil,” Ekpenyong added.
