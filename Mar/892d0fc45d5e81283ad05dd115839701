Paris Saint-Germain forward, Lionel Messi, has decided to stay at the club despite the massive scrutiny surrounding his performances for the French Ligue 1 giants, according to Le Parisien. Messi has struggled for form since joining PSG from Barcelona in the summer of 2021. The 34-year-old has scored just seven goals in 23 games across competitions for Pochettino’s side. Recall that Messi’s performances have drawn criticism from the French media in the past. The PSG number 30 faced heavy criticism after he had his penalty saved by Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois in the Champions League last month. However, the seven-time Ballon d’ Or winner is now prepared to stay with the Parisian outfit for another season. Messi had signed a two-year contract with the option of extending it by another year at the end of the 2022-23 season. The report added that Messi is unhappy with how the French media has treated him in various instances in the past.
