Former President, Olusegun Obasanjo has declared support for an Igbo Presidency in 2023. Obasanjo, while receiving a 2023 Presidential aspirant, Mao Ohuabunwa on Thursday in Abeokuta said it was time for reconciliation in Nigeria by supporting a president from the Southeast region to emerge in 2023. The former president stated that southeasterners can bring a lot to the table if elected. “Beyond bringing unity to Nigeria or being the cement that holds Nigeria together, I believe that Southeasterners can model hard work and entrepreneurship. “This will help in wealth creation and fight against poverty, which is ravaging Nigeria,” Obasanjo said. He warned Ohuabunwa that running for Presidency is a tough job.
