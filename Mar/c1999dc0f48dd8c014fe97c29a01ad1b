The Senate on Tuesday rejected two bills proposed to empower and to attach special recognition to women in Nigeria. One of the bills is seeking the creation of one special seat for a woman at the Senate, House of Representatives and the Federal Capital Territory without prejudice to eligibility to contest. The bill was rejected by senators who voted when it was considered. It said: “The bill seeks to create a special seat for women in the Senate, House of Representatives and the State Houses of Assembly and the Federal Capital Territory reserved solely for women without prejudice to their eligibility to contest in the existing Senatorial seats in each State and FCT.” Also, the proposed 35% affirmative action for women in political party administration was also voted against by Senators. It was earlier reported that the wife of the Vice President, Mrs Dolapo Osinbajo and her entourage were in the Chamber as observers of Tuesday’s legislative proceedings that saw Senators rejecting two bills that concerned the female gender.
