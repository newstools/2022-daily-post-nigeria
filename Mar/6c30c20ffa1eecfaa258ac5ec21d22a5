The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has suspended action on court orders in regards to the defection of Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State and his Deputy, Kelechi Igwe. INEC made this known in a statement issued by Festus Okoye, National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education, on Thursday, in Abuja. This was decided after the commission deliberated on a wide range of issues, including preparations for the Osun State Governorship election in July. Okoye disclosed that the commission decided to stay action on Umahi’s defection at the meeting following conflicting judgements and orders served on it from courts of coordinate jurisdiction. He said: “It will be recalled that INEC met on Thursday, March 17 on the matter, and decided to defer its deliberation on the Ebonyi State cases. “INEC stepped down the listed Memorandum to enable its Legal Services and Clearance Committee to study the new processes served on it in the light of the previously served ones and advise the Commission comprehensively. “Since then, INEC has been served more court processes on the same matter, bringing the total to twelve.” Okoye added that INEC also decided to stay action on the conflicting judgements and orders on Umahi’s defection being aware of the pendency of Appeals and Motions for Stay of Execution of some of the judgements before various divisions of the Court of Appeal.
