The Speaker, House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, has lamented that it is very worrisome to note that Nigeria has 10.5 million out-of-school children roaming the streets aimlessly. According to him, the figure is too outrageous, describing it as a time bomb that can explode any time, which he said would not blow any favourable wind on the entire country’s education sector. Speaking at the flag-off of the enrollment of 500 out- out-school children at the emir’s palace in Gusau, the state capital, under Gba professional Foundation Gbajabiamila, who spoke through his Chief of Staff, Hon. Sanusi Garba Rikiji, said that the situation has called for public concern. Hon. Rikiji, whose Foundation collaborated with that of Gbajabiamila, therefore, urged federal, state governments and stakeholders to join forces in the fight against education backwardness in the country. Hon. Rikiji, who was Speaker of Zamfara State House of Assembly, explained that the 500 out-of-school children were drawn from the 14 local government areas of the state. According to him, Gbajabiamila has designed the program to cover all the states of the federation, saying that Zamfara State got a slot of 500 beneficiaries in the program. “The intervention will enroll them into primary schools with adequate provision of uniforms, footwares and all other facilities to make learning easier until they finish their primary education,” he added.
