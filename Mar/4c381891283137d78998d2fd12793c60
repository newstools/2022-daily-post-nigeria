The Coalition of Southern and Middle Belt Youth Leaders Assembly, COSMBYLA, has called on the Nigeria Police to arrested the Chairman of Muslim Rights Concern, MURIC, Bauchi State chapter, Idrees Safiyanu Gambo, over recent comment against the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG. DAILY POST earlier reported that MURIC, in a statement by the Bauchi Chairman, warned that any political party that picks any member of the RCCG will kiss the Aso Rock goodbye. According to MURIC, RCCG plans to eliminate other religions or turn their faithful into political slaves, adding that any Muslim who queues behind a redeemer in the forthcoming 2023 presidential election is now considered a traitor to the cause of Islam. Reacting, COSMBYLA which is the umbrella body of all the youth groups in the South East, South South, South West and Middle Belt regions condemned the statement, saying it was meant to incite a religious crisis A statement issued by its President General, Goodluck Ibem, said it “is quite unfortunate that a supposed leader of a group who should know better about what obtains in a political setting is reasoning in such a manner”. According to the statement, there is no law in the country that forbids a Christian or any other group from coming together to advance the political fortunes of their members, saying the RCCG has the constitutional right to be involved in politics. The statement reads in part, “It appears that the Bauchi State Chairman of MURIC has not been truthful to himself here on why he made such inciting and divisive statements that can tear the country apart along religious lines. “His statement was born out of selfish interest to promote the political aspiration of a presidential candidate who happens to be a Muslim who he did not mention in the statement. “It is quite unfortunate that people will be so egocentric and wicked to make political statements that can lead to the killing of innocent Nigerians in a bid to enhance the size of their pockets . “We call on the police to arrest and prosecute the MURIC chairman of Bauchi state before he makes another selfish statement that will light up the country in flames”.
