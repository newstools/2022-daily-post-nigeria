France-based midfielder, Innocent Bonke, has insisted that he is not under any pressure after replacing Wilfred Ndidi in the Super Eagles’ squad ahead of Friday’s 2022 FIFA World Cup playoff against Ghana. DAILY POST reports that Super Eagles interim manager, Augustine Eguavoen, had replaced injured Ndidi with Bonke in his side’s squad to face the Black Stars in Kumasi. Ndidi will not be part of both legs against the Black Stars after suffering a knee injury in Leicester City’s 2-1 loss to Rennes in a Europa Conference League round of 16 clash a few days ago. Asked if he’s under pressure after replacing Ndidi, Bonke, who currently plays his club football at Lorient in the French Ligue 1, told reporters at the end of training on Tuesday evening: “It was a late invitation but I have to honour it. “The fact I am going to replace one of the most important players in the team, I don’t have any pressure about that. I am here to do my job. “The game is very, very important for Nigerians and for us as players, we are going to give our best so we come out victorious at the end of the day.” Bonke made his full Super Eagles debut against Cape Verde in September 2021. Meanwhile, after the first-leg tie in Kumasi, the Super Eagles will face Ghana in the second leg in Abuja four days later.
