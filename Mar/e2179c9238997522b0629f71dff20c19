Suspected kidnappers, on Friday, attacked Gonin-Gora community along Abuja-Kaduna road and kidnapped four persons after killing two people. A resident of the area, Julius Obonyilo, told DAILYPOST in Kaduna on Saturday that the bandits stormed Ado Street when residents were fast asleep. According to Obonyilo, “As the kidnappers were passing through Ado Street with their victims, who were crying for help, a 57-year-old man identified as Mr. Jonathan Abuche and his son, James Abuche, 30, quickly rushed out to see what was happening. “As soon as the bandits who were matching the women alongside some livestock to their den saw them, they opened fire on them and killed them instantly.” At the moment, the bandits are yet to establish contact with the victims’ families. Meanwhile, the Kaduna Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige, did not pick his calls when contacted by DAILY POST for comment.
