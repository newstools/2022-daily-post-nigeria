Following the recent attack on a train along the Abuja-Kaduna route, a former lawmaker, Senator Shehu Sani has advised the Federal Government to take advantage of the 37 villages along the route to tackle the security issues in the area. According to the governorship aspirant in Kaduna State, the government should arm the villagers to protect the road and the rail track. In a tweet on his official Twitter handle on Thursday, the former lawmaker opined that using the villagers to solve the security issues in the area would yield more results than the plan to disburse N71 billion for surveillance. He said, “There are 37 villages along Kaduna-Abuja road, if the Govt can recruit, arm & engage the youths of these villages to protect the road & the rail track. “It will be cheaper & more effective than blowing N71 billion in the name of surveillance or whatever ‘solution systems’ they call it”.
