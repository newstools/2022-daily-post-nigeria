Former Brazilian international, Ze Roberto, has given the reason why Manchester United forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, will retire from playing football before he clocks 40 years. Ronaldo turned 37 last month but has expressed his desire to play into his 40s. But Ze Roberto doesn’t think the Portugal captain will still be playing at 40 because the five-time Ballon d’ Or winner has always played at the highest level. According to him, the former Real Madrid and Juventus star has not been among the top three players for the Ballon d’Or in the last two years. “Cristiano is, for me, a machine,” Ze Roberto told Sky Sports over Zoom from Sao Paulo in Brazil. “But I don’t think he will still be going at 40 because he is a player who has always played at the highest level, always winning trophies and always trying to be the best player in the world. “But in the last two years, we have seen he has not been able to do that with Juventus and now with Manchester United. The best proof of that is that he hasn’t been among the top two or three players for the big individual prizes. “He is still a player who costs a lot, but as someone who is used to competing at such a high level, there will come a time when he decides it is better to stop rather than look for something that won’t be the same.”
