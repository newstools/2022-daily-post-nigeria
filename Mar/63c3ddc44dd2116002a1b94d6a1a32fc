Chelsea forward, Kai Havertz, has offered to pay for his own travel to away matches while the Premier League club struggles to operate under the UK government restrictions that have impacted their spending. The Blues’ Russian owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the government and the club is operating under a special licence. This means Chelsea cannot fly the team to Middlesbrough this weekend for their FA Cup clash, but have to do a 10-hour round trip with a bus. But Havertz has said he is ready to pay out of his pocket. “I would pay, it’s no problem. That’s not a big deal for us. “For us to come to the games, that’s the most important thing. I think there are a lot of harder things in the world at the moment if we have to take the train or the bus to an away game. I would pay, it’s no problem. “It’s not easy. I think such a situation has not happened at Chelsea before, so it’s a little bit strange, but we are professionals and sometimes situations like this can happen,” Havertz told reporters on Tuesday, with an FA Cup quarter-final clash at Middlesbrough coming up three days after their trip to Lille in the Champions League.
