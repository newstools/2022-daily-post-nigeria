Former Russian President, Dmitry Medvedev has dismissed as ‘foolishness’, sanctions by the US and its allies against Russia. Medvedev told the Russian state news agency, RIA, that it was “foolish” to expect them to have an effect on government policies. The former President said it is “foolish” to believe that Western sanctions against Russian businesses could have any effect on the government. The Russian ex-president who is the deputy head of the security council said this on Friday, according to Al Jazeera. He said the numerous sanctions on his country will only consolidate its society and not cause popular discontent with the authorities. Russia has received an array of sanctions from the West following its invasion of Ukraine, one month into the war. Russia, on the other hand, has vowed to continue its assault on Ukraine until it accomplishes its goals of “demilitarization and denazification” of Ukraine. “Let us ask ourselves: can any of these major businessmen have even the tiniest quantum of influence of the position of the country’s leadership?” Medvedev said. “I openly tell you: no, no way.” “Now, it will be more difficult to tackle those issues, but on the other hand, we cannot rely on anyone,” Medvedev said. “In this case, we will have to solve those problems ourselves.”
