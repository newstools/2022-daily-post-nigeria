Former Liverpool forward, Dirk Kuyt has predicted that his compatriot, Erik ten Hag, will be successful at Manchester United if he eventually becomes their next permanent manager. Manchester United are currently searching for a new manager that will take over from interim boss, Ralf Rangnick at the end of the season. The Red Devils had already interviewed Ten Hag for the job and the Ajax boss is among the frontrunners alongside Paris Saint-Germain’s Mauricio Pochettino to take charge at Old Trafford. But Kuyt has now endorsed Ten Hag for the Man United job, insisting that the 52-year-old is capable of doing a ‘great job’ at any top European club. Speaking about Ten Hag amid interest from Man United, Kuyt told Goal: “Ten Hag is a great, experienced coach. He has done his apprenticeship, if you like, with Bayern Munich’s second team, then Utrecht and now at Ajax. “He’s a great manager who has improved himself so much, on and off the pitch. “I know some people were doubting his level of speaking English, his performance in front of the camera, but you see him growing every week as a manager, and I think he can do a great job at any top side in Europe. “His tactics, his way of thinking about football, is very interesting, and it would be great if he was to get an opportunity at a top side.”
