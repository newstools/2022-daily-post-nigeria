Sam Amadi, ex-Chairman of the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) has spoken on the Kirikiri Correctional Facility beauty contest. Chidinma Ojukwu, alleged killer of the Super TV CEO, Micheal Ataga, was voted Miss Cell 2022. The University of Lagos (UNILAG) student won the competition which was held to commemorate the 2022 International Women’s Day. Divergent reactions are trailing her emergence. Former presidential aide, Reno Omokri called prison a place of punishment and rehabilitation. “Once it becomes a place of fun, then the whole purpose is defeated. How would the family of Usifo Ataga feel to see Chidinma prancing about as a beauty queen in prison?”, he quipped. In his reaction, Amadi insists there is nothing wrong in organizing beauty competition for prison inmates and one of them winning. He said the important was that the prison service authorized the event in line with penal guidelines and did not grant any inmate a preferential treatment. “Life in prison as convicted person or awaiting trial person should, as much as possible with custodial conditions, go with dignity and pleasure. “A community-based activity that improves knowledge and creativity and enhances joy is in line with custodial condition and penal status”, Amadi added.
