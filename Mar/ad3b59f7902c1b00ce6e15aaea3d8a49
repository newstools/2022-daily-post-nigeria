Femi Adesina, the Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, has lambasted the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, over its recent statement on the state of the nation. The main opposition party had warned that if nothing was done as quickly as possible, the event of October 2020 may repeat itself. But Adesina, in a statement on Tuesday, condemned the PDP for predicting a “nationwide agitation” worse than the October 2020 #EndSARS protests. Adesina said that the PDP would die and would not survive the pressure if they fail to win the 2023 presidential election, just as one of the party’s chieftains had predicted. Adesina pointed out that the statement from the PDP came less than 24 hours after the Department of State Services (DSS) made a claim about certain governors plotting to undermine democracy in the country. The presidential adviser wondered how a political party, which claims to be patriotic should threaten its country with anarchy, social upheaval and disorderliness. Adesina said that this could be because the main opposition party was still suffering from the hangover of being yanked from power in 2015. He advised the PDP to rather work for harmony and cohesion in the country, instead of allegedly plotting or encouraging ‘agitation worse than October 2020 EndSARS.’ “EndSARS signified murder, mayhem, mass destruction, even cannibalism. PDP now wishes Nigeria something worse,” he said. “A presidential aspirant of the PDP has warned that the party would die by 2023, unless it wins the number one position in the country. “And die it would, if the party wishes the country nothing except something worse than EndSARS,” he added.
