Lagos State Government has sealed Havilah Event Centre where petrol was shared as souvenirs during a party in a video currently making the rounds on social media. DAILY POST reports that a video emerged on social media on Saturday showing a party celebrant distributing jerrycans filled with fuel as souvenirs. The video has generated many reactions from social media users as many attributed the action to the current fuel scarcity ravaging the entire country.  Some, however, were rational, figuring out how the celebrant got the product despite the scarcity. Following the circulation of the video officials of the Lagos Safety Commission and the Rapid Response Squad sealed the centre for allegedly contravening public safety rules for allowing. Lagos State Commissioner for Information, Gbenga Omotoso, who made this known in a statement on Saturday said the state’s police commissioner has ordered the arrest of the celebrant and others involved.  He said, “There is no doubt that this action is dangerous and can lead to loss of lives and property”. “The Lagos State Government, through the Safety Commission, is investigating this matter and will ensure that all parties to this reprehensible action are made to account for it. “The safety of lives and property of Lagosians and visitors remains a top priority to the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration. We, therefore, advise that actions that can lead to loss of lives and property be avoided.”
