Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba, has claimed that teammate Cristiano Ronaldo is the best striker in football history. Pogba said the five-time Ballon d’ Or winner cannot be a problem for Manchester United, adding that the Red Devils hurt Tottenham with Ronaldo’s impact. The France World Cup winner said this while reacting to Ronaldo’s display during Man United’s Premier League 3-2 victory against Tottenham on Saturday at Old Trafford. Man United defeated Tottenham at home, thanks to Ronaldo’s hat-trick. “We hurt them [Tottenham] at the right times and Ronaldo did what he does best. He has never been a problem. You have the best striker in history in our team, he cannot be a problem. Today the performance of him and all the team was very brilliant,” Pogba told BBC Sport. He added in his post-match press conference: “Everybody knows Cristiano – there is no need to talk about him. That is what he does. He didn’t play in the last game, but he comes back and scores three goals. Everybody’s happy.” Man United’s next game is against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League round of 16 second-leg tie on Tuesday.
