Vice President Yemi Osinbajo says 20,000 graduates are to get paid internships after participating in the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) programme. The VP added that the Federal Government will continue to deepen business reforms and partner with firms to ensure wholesome national development. Osinbajo spoke on Monday at the commissioning of the Toyota Service and Research Facility in Lagos. He restated government’s commitment to partner with companies because private sector players “are better equipped and resourced to lead the development of the economy”. The Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) said the Buhari administration remains committed to the reforms being driven by the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC). Osinabo hailed the President for his directives, approvals and executive orders for the provision of infrastructure, power, roads, rail, and broadband connectivity. The VP said the National Development Plan (NDP) 2021-2025 is a government-private sector partnership with an investment commitment of N348trillion. “The private sector is expected to invest N298trillion or about 86% of the projected investments. This simply means that government must create the most conducive environment for private enterprise in Nigeria.” He also highlighted other government interventions such as the Investing in Digital and Creative Enterprises programme(i-Dice), an over $600million facility by the AfDB, and the Nigeria Jubilee Fellows Programme (NJFP). The i-Dice programme will support young tech and creative sector entrepreneurs through the provision of finance, skills development and infrastructure. “Under the NJFP, 20,000 graduates, after their youth service, will be given fully-paid internships that will last for 12 months in reputable private and public sector organizations across the country”, Osinbajo said.
