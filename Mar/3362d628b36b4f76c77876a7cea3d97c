Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen, has promised to give his all when Nigeria host Ghana in a 2022 FIFA World Cup second leg playoff in Abuja on Tuesday. Osimhen said he is looking forward to the clash against the Black Stars as well as getting the World Cup ticket for the Super Eagles. The Napoli star played full 90 minutes as Nigeria held Ghana to a 0-0 draw in the first leg on Friday in Kumasi. “I have always been a fan of the Super Eagles, having an opportunity to be here, we have more hurdles. I am looking forward to the game as well as getting the World Cup ticket,” Osimhen told CAFOnline. He added, “To be called up to represent is a dream come true. I will always seize the opportunity to represent the Super Eagles if I am fit and very much okay. “That I was not at the AFCON was a big blow to me, but I give thanks to God for whatever situation I find myself in. “Now I am back with the team and I want to give my all for the common good of the team.”
