The Lagos State Police Command has denied reports that 22-year-old Miss Oluwabamise Ayanwole was mutilated. Lagos State Commissioner of Police Abiodun Alabi made this known while briefing newsmen on Tuesday. He said an autopsy will be conducted on the deceased to ascertain if she was raped. Alabi said, ”No part of her body was mutilated and we cannot ascertain if she was raped. An autopsy will reveal that after post mortem examination.” He further said the driver of the BRT was arrested with the person presumed to be harbouring him. ”He ran to that person’s house. The person was not part of the dastardly act. We have interrogated him and he said the man was not on that bus that day.” he added.
