The Leader Of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, on Wednesday, issued a warning ahead of Saturday’s national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC). He said some APC presidential aspirants would be affected by the outcome of the national convention. In a statement signed by his media aide, Osho Oluwatosin, Primate Ayodele revealed that ‘cabals’ will still succeed in selecting the national chairman of the party even though it will lead to the extinction of some prominent politicians in the party and create crisis. He mentioned that the selection of the national chairman will be defined by aggressiveness and greed, while mentioning some aspirants who won’t see the favour of the cabals. ‘’The fact still remains that the cabal will succeed in selecting the national chairman of the APC. The game plan will change at the centre. Some people who want to contest for 2023 presidency within the party will be affected by the result of the convention. The convention will bring about issues in the party and some bigwigs will be fizzled out in the party as a result of this,” he said. ‘’The process of picking the new chairman of the party will be defined by aggressiveness and greed. Also, Mallam Saliu Mustapha and Abdulazeez Yari will not see the favour of cabals in the convention as national chairman aspirants.’’ He also stated that some people will angrily leave the convention ground due to embarrassment as he foresees the convention coming through in a surprising manner. ‘’The cabal will scale through with their plans in the national convention, let the leaders watch against violence. The convention will come through in a surprising way, there will be a lot of game changers in the convention and it will end some political characters in the APC. ‘’Some will be angry, some will angrily leave the convention ground due to the embarrassment they will witness,’’ he said.
