Former Manchester United striker, Michael Owen, has predicted the outcome of Tuesday’s Champions League round of 16 second-leg matches. Liverpool will host Inter Milan in the Champions League round of 16 second-leg tie at Anfield. Bayern Munich will face RB Salzburg in the Champions League round of 16 second-leg fixture in Germany. The kick-off time for all the games is 9 pm. Providing his predictions, Owen was quoted by BetVictor as saying: “The pressure is on Bayern here. They’ve not been at their best in recent weeks and certainly didn’t play well in Salzburg. “Salzburg are an underrated side, but Bayern are obviously one of the favourites to win the competition, a defeat here would be a disaster. I think they’ll win 2-0.” Commenting on the Liverpool vs Inter Milan game, Owen said: “I wouldn’t say that Liverpool played at their best in Milan, but they did what good sides do, and found a way to win. “Inter had a few chances in that game, and they’ll cause a few problems at Anfield. I don’t think this will be emphatic, Inter are too good a side for that, but I think Liverpool will win this 2-1.”
