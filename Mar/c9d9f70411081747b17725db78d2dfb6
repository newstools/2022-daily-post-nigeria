Rasaq Oyelami Saliu has emerged the gubernatorial candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) for the Saturday, July 16, 2022, Osun gubernatorial election. Saliu’s emergence as the Osun NNPP gubernatorial flagbearer came through affirmation on the part of party members. The affirmation, which was done by all the party delegates from the local government areas of the State, was witnessed by officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Tuesday, March 8, 2022, at the party’s State secretariat, Osogbo. In his acceptance speech, Saliu appreciated the party’s leadership in the State under its State Chairman, Tosin Odeyemi for giving him the opportunity to be the party’s candidate. While promising not to let the party down, he also assured that he will stop capital flights and encourage indigenes living abroad to come home and invest in the State so as to grow the economy when voted in as governor. Welcoming the delegates, the chairman, Primary election committee, Adekunle Abolade, explained that the party’s decision to settle on the candidacy of Saliu was due to the sensitivity of Osun polity. Abolade, who is also the Osun NNPP General Secretary, described the gubernatorial candidate as a capable, competent, enlightened and educated youth whose choice came about after a painstaking selection process. He argued that the gubernatorial candidate has all it takes to liberate the people of Osun from the shackles of backwardness in the comity of States. According to Abolade, “It is a fact that things are not normal, we need to work together to rescue the State. This is our time as youths. The youth and the women are the real electorates, we must vote and protect our votes. “Lets us go out and tell people that NNPP is the only third force people can reckon with in Osun. Let us preach love and show them that love exists among us.”
