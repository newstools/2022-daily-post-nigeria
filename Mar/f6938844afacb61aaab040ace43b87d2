Kanye West has been suspended from Instagram after attacking his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, Pete Davidson and Trevor Noah on the social media platform. The rapper was suspended after violating Instagram’s hate speech, bullying, and harassment policies. Kanye will be unable to post, comment, or send DMs for 24 hours or more. This is coming after Kanye West made a racial comment at Trevor Noah after the host of “The Daily Show” called him out for “harassing” Kim Kardashian amid their divorce. Addressing the ongoing drama between West and Kardashian and her new boyfriend Pete Davidson on his Comedy Central show, Tuesday night, Noah described Kim’s experience with Ye as one of the terrifying experiences women have to go through. He said, “What Kardashian is going through is terrifying to watch, and it shines a spotlight on what so many women go through when they choose to leave. “What we are seeing is one of the most powerful, one of the richest women in the world, unable to get her ex to stop texting her, to stop chasing after her, to stop harassing her. “As a society, we have to ask ourselves questions. Do we wish to stand by and watch a car crash when we thought we saw it coming?” Reacting to this, West shared a screenshot from a Google search result, describing Noah as a “South African comedian”. He also captioned the post “All in together now… K–n baya my lord k–n baya K–n baya my lord K–n baya Oooo’ lord K–n baya.” Shortly after, Instagram took down Kanye’s page till further notice. Recall that Kanye repeatedly harassed his ex-wife Kardashian, and her boyfriend, Davidson, in the last few weeks. He accused the reality tv star of depriving him of contact with his four children.
