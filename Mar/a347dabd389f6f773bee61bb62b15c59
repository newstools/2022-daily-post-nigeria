Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has revealed what he told his players at half-time during his side’s Premier League 4-0 win over Burnley on Saturday evening. Chelsea defeated Burnley at Turf Moor, thanks to second-half goals from Reece James, Kai Havertz (2) and Christian Pulisic. The match had ended in a 0-0 draw at half-time. Speaking during his post-match press conference after the match, Tuchel said he reminded his players where they needed to step up at half-half. Asked what he said to his players at half-time, the German told reporters: “It was very calm. We reminded everyone what we wanted to do and where we needed to step up. We had to make life more difficult for their back four.” He added, “The goal opened the game and gave us belief and confidence and then our attacks were more fluid. Then we were more decisive. “The pitch was so dry and we had a lot of ball possession, but it was difficult to accelerate the game.”
