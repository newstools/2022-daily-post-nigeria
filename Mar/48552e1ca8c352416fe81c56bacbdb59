Many shops have been destroyed in a fire outbreak at Apongbon market in Lagos Island. The fire, which broke out on Wednesday morning, has caused a gridlock on the Eko Bridge. The cause of the inferno is yet to be determined as of the time of filing this report. However, the federal and Lagos fire services are at the scene of the incident, trying to put out the fire. In a tweet via its Twitter handle, the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) announced that the fire outbreak has resulted in the slow movement of motorists and advised that they use alternative routes. It tweeted: “There’s currently fire incidence underneath Eko Bridge which has resulted to slow movement of motorists. “Motorists who are yet to connect Eko Bridge are advised to use alternative routes such as Third-Mainland Bridge and Carter Bridge. “Emergency Responding Agencies like Fire Service, LASEMA, LASTMA are all on ground.” DAILY POST reports that this is coming less than two weeks after a three-storey building in the Mushin area of Lagos State was gutted by fire following the explosion of a tanker discharging Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) at a nearby petrol station.
