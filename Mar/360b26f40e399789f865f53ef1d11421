PSG forward, Kylian Mbappe has sent a strong message to his teammates following their 3-0 loss at Monaco in Ligue 1. Mbappe said the players must learn to respect one another, their supporters, as well as their families. The 23-year-old is expected to leave the club in the summer when his contract expires, having turned down the offer to renew his deal. Mbappe admitted that his former club, Monaco deserved their win because they were determined and perfectly executed their game plan. “They deserved to win,” Mbappe told Amazon Prime Video after the match. “The goal is to go for the 10th league title. The rest doesn’t matter. “Even if we win 8-0 or 9-0, people will still be thinking about the Champions League. We must remain professional and respect each other. “We have to respect the fans who support us, the people and our families. You have to respect yourself if you have a shred of respect for what you do.”
