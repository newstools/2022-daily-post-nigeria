Russia is expected to strike at the information warfare and psychological operations centre of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the technological facilities of the country’s security service in Kyiv. However, it called on citizens living nearby to leave their homes, Russian Defence Ministry spokesman, Maj.-Gen. Igor Konashenkov told reporters on Tuesday. “In order to suppress information attacks against Russia, the technological facilities of the SBU and the 72nd main PSYOPS centre in Kyiv will be hit with high-precision weapons,” Konashenkov said. “We call on Ukrainian citizens attracted by Ukrainian nationalists to carry out provocations against Russia, as well as residents of Kyiv living near relay centres, to leave their homes.” Konashenkov noted that with the commencement of the special military operation, the number of cyberattacks on different state institutions of Russia had increased many-fold. Last Thursday, Russia invaded Ukraine after weeks of rising political tensions. The conflict escalated on Friday, with reports of fighting within the capital city of Kyiv. Shocking footage recorded nearby showed the weapon flying into the building, located near Zhuliany airport, while CCTV recorded from inside also shows the extent of the damage after the site was hit. The United Nations (UN) had last Friday said it had received reports of at least 127 civilian casualties, out of which 25 were killed and 102 injured in the Ukraine crisis caused by shelling and airstrikes from Russia.
