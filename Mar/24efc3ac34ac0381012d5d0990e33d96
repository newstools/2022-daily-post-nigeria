Manchester United legend, Gary Neville, has changed his mind over the manager he wants the club to appoint as their next permanent manager. Recall that Man United had appointed current manager, Ralf Rangnick, on an interim basis. Neville had backed Paris-Saint-German’s Mauricio Pochettino to succeed Rangnick at the end of the season. But the former defender has now changed his mind, urging Man United to appoint Chelsea’s Thomas Tuchel as their next permanent manager if the German is available at the end of the season. Asked if he would take Thomas Tuchel at Man United during an Instagram Live, Neville replied: “Well, you couldn’t say no, could you? “You couldn’t say no if you got Thomas Tuchel, but I’m not sure he’ll leave Chelsea – maybe he will.” Asked if he prefers Tuchel over Pochettino and Ajax’s Erik Ten Hag, Neville continued: “Well, he’s the most certain at the moment I would say, with the fact he’s got recent success in the Champions League and Club World Cup. “I thought they were very unlucky not to beat Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final to be honest, the chances they had were unbelievable. “So I would be happy with him. And I think he’s done brilliantly the last few weeks handling difficult questions, difficult situations at Chelsea, all the stuff that’s been going on.”
