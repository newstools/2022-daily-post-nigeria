A former member of the House of Representatives, Abdulmumin Jibrin, has said Bola Tinubu, a presidential aspirant of the All progressives Congress, APC, and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo are “inseparable”. Jibrin said the birthday messages between Osinbajo and Tinubu show mutual respect. In a tweet on his verified Twitter handle, Jibrin said nobody can love Tinubu and Osinbajo more than they love each other. “I believe Tinubu and Osinbajo are inseparable. I love the messages they sent to each other on their respective birthdays and I believe irrespective of politics and speculations, it came from their hearts. “You cannot love any of them more than the love they share for each other,” Jibrin wrote. While Tinubu has declared his intention to become the next president of Nigeria, Osinbajo has remained mum. Osinbajo served as Attorney-General and Commissioner of Justice between 1999 and 2007. At the time, Tinubu was Lagos Governor.
