Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool legends, Thierry Henry, Peter Schmeichel and Jamie Carragher have rejected the referee’s decision to send off Alexis Sanchez during Inter Milan Champions League round of sixteen clash with the Reds on Tuesday. Liverpool got lucky in the Champions League against Inter Milan as they managed a 2-1 aggregate over the Italian side. Sanchez was sent off for a second bookable offence just a minute after Lautaro Martinez scored for the Serie A giants to make the tie 2-1 to the Reds on aggregate. But the red card to the Chilean scuppered Inter Milan’s chance of a comeback. His first yellow card was straightforward, catching Thiago’s right knee with his studs but the second was a lot less clear. “I’m sorry if you’ve played football and I think sometimes the referee just goes by the book,” Henry told BT Sport. “What are you supposed to do? He gets the ball, your foot is going to go up because you’re kicking the ball away. “We see on the replay full speed you don’t have time to take the ball away by kicking the ball. If he (the referee) plays football that’s not a yellow.” Schmeichel said, “You go forward with your leg and at speed, there’s no way you can pull the leg out. Sanchez wins the ball that’s enough.” And Liverpool legend, Carragher added: “Sometimes a foul or situation like that where I probably have less sympathy was if Alexis won the ball with his studs. “He doesn’t win the ball with his studs, he wins it with his foot which has to go somewhere. “It’s not even that high it’s on the ankle or the boot. It’s probably just a foul and that’s debatable. “The fact he went into his boot it’s nowhere near a yellow card but you could argue the two fouls put together is a red card maybe.”
