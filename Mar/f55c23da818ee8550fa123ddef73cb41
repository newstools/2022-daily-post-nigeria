Immediate past Senate President, Abubakar Saraki, has given reasons he should be elected as Nigeria’s president in 2023. Saraki, speaking on Sunday Politics, a Channels TV programme, said he knows the issues affecting Nigeria and can reach out across the ethnic and religious divides. “I believe I have what it takes to lead Nigeria. I am not someone who shies away from taking up challenges. I’m not someone who does not know the issues or someone who does not have the energy and vibrancy to address those issues. “More importantly, I am someone that can reach out across the political divide, based on my antecedents. I am someone who can reach out across the ethnicity divide and across the religious divide,” Saraki said. The former Senate President disclosed that he will officially declare his intention to run for president in 2023 after the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, decides which geopolitical zone will get its presidential ticket. Saraki said, “We’ll have a NEC (PDP) meeting on Tuesday. Hopefully, the guidelines will come out which will tell us definitely where the whistle would be blown. “Short of anything that stops an individual, I will definitely be announcing sometime before the end of the month, my intention to vie for president. At the moment, we are just doing consultation. Formal declaration will come in due course.”
