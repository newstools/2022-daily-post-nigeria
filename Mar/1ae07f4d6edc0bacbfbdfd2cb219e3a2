The increasing rate of urbanization in Rivers State presents the need to review or develop new master plans local government areas of the state. This is according to the Rivers State chapter chairman of the National Institute of Town Planners, Emmanuel Ikechukwu. Ikechukwu, who spoke in an interview in Port Harcourt on Tuesday, said it may be disastrous if the state fails to plan ahead of its increasing population. According to him “Most of the local government areas have master plans but they have not been implemented and those master plan are also obsolete at this time. “That is why there is need for the review of all those master plans and even to come up with new plans. “That is what they need to do now because if you look at the rate of urbanization in Rivers state it is very high and if plans are not made it is going to be disastrous”. Ikechukwu, while acknowledging that the recent demolition of shanties in parts of the state is part of the urbanization programme of the government, however, said the government must engage adequately with the affected people.
