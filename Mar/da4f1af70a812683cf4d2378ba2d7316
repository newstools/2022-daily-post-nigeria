Anxiety has heightened among residents of Omi Adio community, Ibadan, Oyo State, over the killing of four people by some suspected armed robbers. DAILY POST gathered on Sunday that the incident occurred on Friday. It was gathered that the armed robbers stormed Alade-Owo Estate community in Omi-Adio, in Ido Local Government Area around 7 pm on Friday. Our correspondent gathered that the armed robbers killed the four persons while trying to escape from the scene of an operation. The deceased include a commercial motorcycle rider. They were killed by the gunmen who shot indiscriminately while escaping from the community. It was gathered that the armed robbers, numbering about three, were said to be fleeing after an operation and shot at the victims while trying to clear their way towards the linked tarred road to the community. Some of the residents disclosed that the robbers, who stormed the community with a motorcycle, had earlier attacked the residence of a Point of Sales (POS) operator in the area. It was gathered that the armed robbers carted away an unspecified amount of money. However, efforts made by DAILY POST to get a reaction from the Public Relations Officer of the state police command, Adewale Osifeso, proved to be abortive as an SMS text sent to him has not been replied to as at the time of filing this report on Monday.
