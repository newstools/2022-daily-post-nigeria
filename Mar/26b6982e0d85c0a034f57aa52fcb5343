As the two Manchester clubs prepare to lock horns in the Premier League this weekend, Arsenal legend, Martin Keown has advised Manchester United on the perfect formation to hit their city rivals. The Red Devils can brighten their chances of making the Premier League top four if they can overpower City at the Etihad on Sunday. A victory would land a huge blow for Pep Guardiola’s Man City’s title hopes and reduce their lead over Liverpool to just 3 points, with the Reds having a game in hand. Manchester United have enjoyed a solid record at the Etihad in recent visits, winning twice there last season. Keown wants Manchester United’s interim boss, Ralf Rangnick to switch to a back three to frustrate Pep Guardiola’s City, like other teams have done this season. Keown told talkSPORT, “Solskjaer had a good record because he would often change his system to a back three, which is probably something Rangnick should think about this week. “Although Rangnick has had a good seven days to prepare. I know he’s trying to get that message across about pressing high through a 4-3-3 system, but I think it’s ready-made to change because Maguire needs protection in the back three. “It’s not a given who the back three would be, or the wingbacks, but I do feel it’s worth considering. “Spurs beat them twice this season playing with a back five, maybe it’s a problem for Man City. They are struggling to break teams down.” Keown noted that Manchester City were bit lucky last week during their Premier League game against Everton when the referee overlooked a handball that should have been awarded Frank Lampard’s side. He believes that with the right decisions, Ralf Rangnick can win the game and cement their place in the Champions League place.
