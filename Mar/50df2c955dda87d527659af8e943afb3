The Nigerian Army has pledged to continue to provide the needed support for the Nigeria Military School (NMS) Zaria to produce high-quality manpower for the armed forces and the nation. The Chief of Administration (Army) Maj.-Gen. Usman Muhammed gave the assurance at the Maiden Edition of Ex-Boys Congress and award night on Saturday in Abuja. Muhammed, who is also the Chairman, Governing Board of NMS, said the Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Faruk Yahaya had continued to show commitment towards addressing all the needs of the school. He urged the commandant of the school to bring forward all issues affecting the progress of NMS, assuring that all the needs of the school would be addressed. “I think it is a worthwhile thing for us to see products of NMS doing well and I am always sad when I hear that products of NMS are not doing well. “So myself and the commandant have sat down and we are doing a lot to improve on the quality of those who go into and also those who graduate from NMS. “This is to ensure that at the end of the day, when they come out, they can stand up to anybody anywhere and you can beat your chest and say you are the best around. “We will do everything possible and we are open to new ideas about anything you think we can do to improve on the quality of NMS,” he said. The Commandant of NMS, Brig.-Gen. Jonathan Aun said the school had undoubtedly produced seasoned military officers of repute and highly experienced technocrats that had contributed and are still contributing to the development of Nigeria. Aun said the NMS has become a national asset that serves as a nest to hatch and nurse national unity apart from supplying the quality manpower needs of the Nigerian armed forces. He said the admission policy of NMS had ensured equity in the intake of boys across the federation, adding that it had created bridges for permanent relationships emanating from trust built over the years.
