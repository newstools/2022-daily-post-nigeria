Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has said Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s departure to Barcelona was a joint decision. According to the Spaniard, it was reached by three parties: Arsenal, Aubameyang and Barcelona. The Gabon striker saw his contract with the Gunners terminated in January, so he could sign for the LaLiga giants as a free agent. “We always make decisions in the best interests of the club and to get the best performances from the team. “We made that decision as three parties. One was the club, one was Auba, and the other was Barcelona. The three of us believed it was the right thing to do,” Arteta told Sky Sports. Aubameyang has been flourishing since he arrived in Spain, scoring five times so far for Barca.
