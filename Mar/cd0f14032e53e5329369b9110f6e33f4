Paris Saint-Germain sporting director, Leonardo, has insisted that the club have never considered replacing current manager, Mauricio Pochettino, with former Real Madrid boss, Zinedine Zidane, or any other manager. Reports had emerged that Zidane would succeed Pochettino, who has been heavily linked with a move to Manchester United. Pochettino, along with Ajax coach, Erik ten Hag, is among the top contenders to replace Ralf Rangnick at Manchester United at the end of the season. But speaking on the development, Leonardo dismissed the report that Zidane will take over from Pochettino, adding that the Argentine is ‘happy’ at the French Ligue 1 giants. He told L’Equipe: “Today he [Pochettino] has one year left on his contract (June 2023). Honestly, we never thought about changing coaches. Really. “We never got in touch with Zidane or anyone else. Before coming here, Pochettino was among the top five coaches and still is. You can see the progression, although a lot has happened. “I always see him more involved because, over time, you know the context better. Is Pochettino happy in Paris? Yes. I think he may have had moments of doubt, but he never asked to leave.” He added, “He may have had difficult periods. In February or March, he had Covid. Then, during the summer, there were rumours of his departure. “He says no club asked him and no one called us. I have no problem with Pochettino. We are very clear, we talk about everything.”
