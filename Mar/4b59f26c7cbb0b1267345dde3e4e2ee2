Senator Aishatu Dahiru, known as Binani, has declared intention to run for the office of governor in Adamawa State. Binani’s aspiration became public knowledge on Tuesday when her statement of declaration was made available to newsmen in the state capital, Yola. Binani who currently represents the Adamawa Central Senatorial Zone in the National Assembly under All Progressives Congress (APC), indicated in the statement that she will be seeking the party’s ticket in the pursuant of her dream. In her declarative statement entitled, ‘A Call to Serve, A Call to Duty: The Journey Has Just Begun’, Binani said she made her declaration after pressure became so much on her in the last couple of months. “I reflected and prayed over it and consulted widely from across all the 21 local government areas of the state and arrived at the conclusion that hundreds of calls cannot be wrong,” she stated.
She said she saw the calls of people as calls to duty, adding, “I formally declare my intention to contest for the office of Governor of Adamawa State, Insha Allah.” Binani who said Adamawa State has come of age at 31 years of creation but has a long way to go in development, assured that she is offering herself to move the state forward. Recalling that she had served her state first as a House of Representatives member and now as Senator, Binani asserted that her capacity to serve has become well known. She said her performance as a House of Representatives member made people call on her to gun for the Senate in 2019, and that since being in the Senate, she had been serving again to the best of her ability and asking what more she could do not only for her Senatorial constituency but for the whole of Adamawa State. This, according to her, has been a motivating factor to seek the Adamawa State Governorship seat.
