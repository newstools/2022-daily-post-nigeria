The Kano State Commissioner for Local Governments, Alhaji Murtala Sule Garo, has denied knowledge of alleged moves to impeach the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Engr. Hamisu Ibrahim Chidari and his Deputy, Zubairu Hamza Massu. Garo described the reports as a serious miscalculated attempt to create problems in the state. An online medium had alleged that Garo was masterminding some moves to impeach Chidari and his deputy, Massu. But in a quick reaction, Murtala queried, “Am I a member of the assembly, what is my concern with the Speaker? This report is one among many that are targeted at my political career and the Government of Kano State.” Garo insisted that he had never in any way interfered with the state assembly, adding that his role is with the local governments and stopped there. The report claimed it that the Majority leader of the House, Labaran Abdul Madari, of Warawa Constituency, Chief Whip, former Majority Leader and former Speaker, Abdulaziz Gafasa, are also involved in the alleged impeachment plot on the directives of Garo, but he asked, “how can I use these heavy politicians? When did I grow to this level of influencing these powerful politicians? The alleged impeachment plot came up after the Kano South All Progressives Congress mega rally that took place in Rano. Both Cidari and his Deputy were loyalists of Kabiru Rurum when he was Speaker. Garo is one of the most powerful and closest allies of the governor. He is seen by many as the anointed candidate for the governorship seat because of the full support he enjoys from the First Lady, Hafsat Ganduje
