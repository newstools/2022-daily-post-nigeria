The Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation (NTDC) has bemoaned the drop in tourism activities in Cross River State which used to be a hub in the country. The Director-General of NTDC, Mr Folorunsho Coker said the hospitality sector used to be second to none in Nigeria but that it has in the last few years slowed down. Speaking at Marina Resort in the state, Coker said some people have blamed COVID-19 and the EndSARS protest of 24th October 2020 for the downturn. “Cross River has always been the cradle of tourism in Nigeria but suddenly, tourism in the state has taken a slow turn. “Calabar cannot fail in tourism and the entertainment industry but it is up to the residents to galvanise themselves to support and grow it.” He cautioned that much expectation should not be on the government to revive the sector as that could take a long time in coming. He pledged to persist in organising programmes that would revitalise the sector. “I am going to commit myself further, every year, we would do something incrementally bigger in Cross River, especially in Calabar, especially at this Marina Resort and the islands to boost tourism,” he said. He encouraged residents of the state to champion the image redemption of Cross River using social media. Remarking, managing director of Cross River Tourism Bureau, Mr Utsu Atsu said, “One of the things we have tried to do since 2021 was to diversify the tourism potentials of the state while concentrating on ecotourism. “What NTDC has done here today has helped our tourism space, it has also improved the standard and efficiency of local businessmen and entrepreneurs at the Marina Resort. “This will drive disposable income, allow the people to earn more and take care of their families, generally making the state better”, he said.
