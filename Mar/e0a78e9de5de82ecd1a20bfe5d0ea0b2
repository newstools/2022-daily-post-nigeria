Former Manchester United captain, Roy Keane, has slammed players in the current squad for “giving up” during their 4-1 defeat at Manchester City on Sunday. Keane questioned their lack of desire and insisted some of them shouldn’t play for the Red Devils. “Manchester United gave up and in a derby, in any game, it’s unforgivable. “I can forgive mistakes, but not running back, not trying to tackle – there are players out there who shouldn’t play for Manchester United,” Keane told Sky Sports. Kevin Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez scored twice each, while Jadon Sancho got the only goal for United. The win leaves United in fifth place one point behind Arsenal, who have three matches in hand.
