Pastor Enoch Adeboye of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, has disclosed why he wanted to resign as the church’s General Overseer a few years ago. Adeboye said he wanted to resign because he felt his members never cared that he was labouring in prayers and fasting for them. Addressing his members, Pastor Adeboye said while deciding to resign, he took a nap, and when he woke up, a young girl who had come to see him; gave him a cake. According to Adeboye, he was so touched by the gesture that he ate the cake. “I thought you said no one cared,” That was when I realized that I had paid so much attention to appreciation from the people that I did not remember how much God cares for and loves me,” he said. “Now, when as a believer you are feeling depressed, what you need is to go deep into the presence of God because Psalm 16:11 says: “Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures forevermore.”
