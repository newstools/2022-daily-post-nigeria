British Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, has said that the west needs to ensure the Russian economy is crippled so that President Vladimir Putin will not be able to continue his invasion of Ukraine. Truss said this during a news conference in Lithuania on Thursday. “We need to … degrade the Russian economy,” Truss said. “We need to make sure … that the Russian economy is crippled, so it is unable to continue to fund Putin and the war machine.” Meanwhile, the war between Russia and Ukraine began last Thursday. The war enters its eighth day today with huge casualties already recorded. President Putin had ordered the invasion of Ukraine over disagreement on some political issues.
