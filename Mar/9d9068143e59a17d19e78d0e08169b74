Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, has termed the Senate’s rejection of bill to give women in the country the leverage they need as a major setback for Nigeria. According to Akeredolu, who was critical of the Senate’s action, it was a squandered chance for the country’s progress and development. In a statement released by his Chief Press Secretary, Richard Olatunde, the governor commended the House of Representatives for its boldness in passing the bills, saying that it has shown its willingness to align with the national sentiment. While defining women as a rare breed and a distinct species of humanity, Akeredolu asserted that their contributions to the country and many fields of endeavor are boundless. While revealing that he will always identify with the female gender, the governor encouraged women to “be hopeful. “Proudly, I stand ‘Gidigba’ with women on this course and many others to liberate women from the artificial barricades and shackles constructed by men and the society at large.”
