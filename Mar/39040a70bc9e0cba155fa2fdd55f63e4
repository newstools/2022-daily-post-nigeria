Former Paris Saint-Germain winger, Jerome Rothen has slammed Lionel Messi, following his display in his side’s Champions League 3-1 defeat to Real Madrid this week. Rothen said he is ashamed to talk about Messi, adding that the Argentine captain was a ‘mess’ during PSG’s encounter with Real Madrid. Messi was unable to save PSG, as Real Madrid eliminated the French Ligue 1 giants from the Champions League round of 16 second-leg tie in Spain, thanks to Karim Benzema’s hat-trick. Speaking on the development, Rothen pointed out how Luka Modric was able to get the better of Messi during the match. He said on Rothen’s enflamme: “I’m ashamed to talk about Messi like that, but it’s the reality! Yesterday he walked on the pitch. He made an effort from 10 meters! Modric put it in his pocket!” He added, “The other – it annoys me so much to mention his name – he lost all his balls! Since he’s been there, it’s been a mess! “He has played less than 50% of PSG matches, and when he’s here, we’re going to find excuses for him by saying that he was coming back from an injury? No, there’s no time; it was last night that you had to be there.”
