Mai Mala Buni, National Chairman, Caretaker/Extraordinarily Convention Planning Cammittee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has refuted reports making the rounds that he has suspended some of the activities inítiated and executed by the CECPC under the acting Chairman and Niger State Governor, Muhammed Sani Bello. According to him, the report which went viral during the week, wherein he was quoted to have declared some of the activities of Bello, during his absence, as invalid, is not true. In a statement he signed and made available to newsmen in Abuja on Thursday, Buni maintained that activities initiated and executed by Bello remain valid, adding that he duly transmitted power to the Niger State Governor before embarking on his journey abroad. “This is to bring to the notice of all stakeholders and members of the party that the purported suspension of some activities inítiated and executed by the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning committee under the acting Chairman and Niger State Governor, H.E. Muhammed Sani Bello, IS NOT TRUE,” he said. “Therefore, all activities that were done in my absence remain valid and binding. All party stakeholders and members are hereby advised to disregard the previous statement discarding the activities of the Committee under the leadership of the Acting Chairman. “It could be recalled that I had duly transmitted power to His Excellency, the Niger State Governor, H.E. Muhammed Sani Bello to enable me undergo medical attention. Therefore, all actions and measures taken by the Committee under his leadership as Acting Chairman, remain effective.” He said that at this point, the APC is calling for support and understanding to move the party forward to a successful Convention slated for March 26th, 2022.
