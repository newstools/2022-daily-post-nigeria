Tottenham boss, Antonio Conte has said that Arsenal have an advantage over his side in the race to finish fourth in the Premier League. Tottenham defeated London rivals, West Ham United 3-1 on Sunday to keep up the pressure on Mikel Arteta’s Gunners. Arsenal are currently occupying the fourth place in the Premier League and are three points ahead of Spurs, who have played one game more. Spurs will play Arsenal later on in the season in a game that could decide who secures the final Champions League place. But the former Chelsea boss believes Arsenal already have a ‘good advantage’ over Spurs. “The only way to put pressure on Arsenal is to get three points to win,” Conte said after Spurs beat West Ham. “For sure they [Arsenal] have a good advantage, also especially because they’ve been working with the same coach for many years and they’ve had many transfer markets with the same coach. “Maybe they are at this moment more ready than us.”
