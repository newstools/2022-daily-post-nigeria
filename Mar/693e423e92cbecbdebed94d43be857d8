Nigerian winger, Samuel Chukwueze, has told the Black Stars of Ghana that it is every Nigerian’s dream for the Super Eagles of Nigeria to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar later this year. Chukweze said the Super Eagles of Nigeria would aim to bounce back from their 2021 AFCON disappointment by beating Ghana to qualify for the World Cup. Recall that Nigeria was eliminated from the 2021 AFCON in the round of 16 against Tunisia. Nigeria and Ghana will clash in a double-leg World Cup playoffs this month. The first leg will take place on Friday in Kumasi, while Nigeria will host Ghana in the second leg in Abuja four days later. Speaking to reporters at the end of training on Tuesday evening, Chukwueze, who currently plays his club football at Villarreal, said: “To me bounce back is to win the games against Ghana and to qualify for the 2022 World Cup because it’s every Nigerian dream to see their country participate in the World Cup. “The only bounce back we need is to win and make our country proud.”
