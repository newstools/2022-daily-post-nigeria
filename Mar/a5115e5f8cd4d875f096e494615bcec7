Nigeria interim technical adviser, Augustine Eguavoen, has said the Super Eagles deserve a place at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar more than Ghana. The two West African rivals will slug it out for a place at the tournament later this month. The first leg will be played at the Cape Coast Stadium on March 25, with the reverse fixture to take place at the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja four days later. Eguavoen believes Nigeria are in a better position to qualify for the World Cup. “There is no doubt in my mind. I am a Nigerian, a full-blooded Nigerian, and if you asked me such a question, I think, without missing words, we deserve a place at the World Cup,” he told Ghanasportspagea. “It’s going to be a very tough game and a tight one as well. “We have a lot of mutual respect for one another, and when Ghana plays Nigeria and Nigeria plays Ghana, it’s always tough, it’s always tight. But you see, it’s going to boil down to us trying to go there (Ghana). “We will play everything we can to try to win the game, in fact, both games, but with no disrespect because Ghana is a very strong side, individually and collectively. We will just go and fight and try to win the game.”
