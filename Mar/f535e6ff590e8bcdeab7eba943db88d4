The Federal High Court in Ibadan has subpoenaed a Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) Deputy Superintendent, J. O. Oyaleke. The officer was summoned over his failure to produce Oluwadamilola Otuyalo in court. The defendant is being prosecuted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Otuyalo was remanded for his alleged involvement in cybercrimes to the tune of £45,000. Oyaleke, attached to Justice Uche Agomoh’s court, has the responsibility of producing defendants sent to prison. The officer failed to produce Otuyalo on December 2, 2021, which had been slated for commencement of trial. Oyaleke told the court that the defendant was among the 401 inmates who fled Abolongo correctional facility on October 22, 2021. He said the NCoS in Oyo State was working with relevant agencies to ensure the re-arrest. Justice Agomoh adjourned till June 29, 2022. Otuyalo faces a five-count charge for internet fraud and had pleaded “not guilty”. One of the counts violate Section 15 (2) (d) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011 (amended), punishable under Section 15 (3) of the same Act.
