Ali Modu Sheriff, a former Governor of Borno State, on Sunday, stepped down from the race for the national chairmanship of the All Progressives Congress, APC. Sheriff explained that his decision was due to the party’s zoning arrangement and President Muhammadu Buhari’s position. Addressing journalists in Abuja, the former National Chairman of the party, said he can’t work against Buhari. APC had zoned its National Chairmanship position to the North-Central. However, Sheriff said he would contest if APC cancels the zoning arrangement between now and Friday. According to Sheriff: “Being someone who respects the rule of law and the leaders of the party, the president has taken a position. I have always told you that I will contest if it is zoned to my zone. “I respect the president as my leader, and he must have a reason why the national chairman is zoned to the North-central. Therefore I will no longer contest unless the party leadership decides to throw it open between now and Friday.” The former governor had said he was more qualified than other contestants for APC National Chairmanship.
