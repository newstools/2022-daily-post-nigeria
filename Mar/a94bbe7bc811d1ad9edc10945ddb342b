A Dei-dei Grade I Area Court in Abuja, on Thursday, sentenced a 32-year-old fuel attendant, Ngbede Musa, to seven months imprisonment for misappropriating N435,390. The convict, who lives in Mararaba, Nasarawa State, pleaded guilty to criminal breach of trust and misappropriation and begged the court for forgiveness. “Indeed I accept that I committed the offence. I want to tell the court that I paid part of the remaining N200,000,” he said. The Judge, Mr Sulyman Ola, said, ”Having found the convict guilty of the offence, in line with his plea for mercy and a first time offender, who did not waste the time of the court, he is hereby sentenced to seven months imprisonment with an option to pay N30,000 fine.” The Judge further warned the convict to desist from committing crimes. Ola also ordered the convict to pay the complainant, Daniel Adams, of AYM filling station, Dawaki Abuja, N200,000 which the prosecutor had requested for. Earlier, the Prosecution Counsel, Mr Chinedu Ogada told the court that Daniel Adams of AYM filling station, Dawaki, Abuja, reported the case at Dawaki Police station on February 8, at about 2:30 pm. Ogada told the court that Musa, who was in charge of selling engine oil at the fuel station, fraudulently sold products worth N435,390, and converted the money for his personal use. He said the offence contravened the provisions of sections 312 and 309 of the Penal Code Law. (NAN)
