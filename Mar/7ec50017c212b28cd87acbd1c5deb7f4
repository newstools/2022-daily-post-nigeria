The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State has described as unproductive political insinuation, the statement credited to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) gubernatorial candidate, Senator Ademola Adeleke asking Osun to reject Oyetola’s normalization of poverty. In a statement by the Osun APC Director of Publicity, Research and Strategy, Barrister Kunle Oyatomi and obtained by DAILY POST, the party noted that the Osun populace was wiser, having seen what the Adegboyega Oyetola administration had done. While declaring that the PDP will meet its waterloo in the July 16 gubernatorial election in the State, the APC challenged Adeleke to engage himself in research work, in all the nooks and crannies of Osun on developmental projects and programmes being executed by the State governor. The Osun APC enjoined him to start his research from his home town, Ede, and tell the whole world how Edeland had immensely benefited from Oyetola’s projects. “For God’s sake, we don’t know who is pushing Ademola to be governor of the State of Osun. He has neither the understanding, nor the quality of a governor in a State like Osun. He could have done better as an entertainer in Nollywood, afterall, that’s what he wanted to be. “We have said it sometime ago that by the time Governor Oyetola spent 2 years in office, people of Osun, including the opposition members, would literally beg him to continue in office after his first term. So, the people would rather be glad to have Oyetola than Ademola in Abere. “What PDP has made of itself in Osun is not only a shame to democratic politics in Nigeria. Ademola is not worthy of being in charge of the government, because he has nothing to offer the people of the State. “Osun citizenry know better than Ademola thinks and they will surprise him again in the July 16 gubernatorial election with a very painful defeat which his dancing skill cannot stop,” Oyatomi concluded.
