Former Manchester United and Real Madrid striker, Michael Owen, has predicted the outcome of tonight’s Champions League fixtures. Manchester United will host Atletico Madrid in the Champions League round of 16 second-leg tie at Old Trafford. Ajax will face Benfica in the Champions League round of 16 second-leg fixture at the Amsterdam ArenA. The kick-off time for all the matches is 9 pm. Providing his predictions, Owen was quoted by BetVictor as saying: “These two played out a very entertaining first leg, and I think this will be just as open. “It’s never been easy to get a result in Amsterdam, and with the home crowd behind them, I think the Dutch side will get through here. They are absolutely flying domestically, so if they can find that sort of form, I think they’ll have too much. Ajax 3-1 Benfica.” Commenting on the Manchester United vs Atletico Madrid game, Owen said: “That was a great result for Manchester away in Madrid. We all know how patchy they’ve been domestically, but I think Europe comes as a welcome distraction. “This isn’t the Atletico of old when they had, arguably, the best defence in Europe, so I think United can get a result here. Man United 1-0 Atletico Madrid.”
