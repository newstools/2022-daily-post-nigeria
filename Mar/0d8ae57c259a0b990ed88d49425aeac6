Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) National Chairman, Malami Falalu Bello, says the party is not considering zoning the 2023 presidential ticket. Bello spoke on Saturday during a meeting of the National Working Committee (NWC) with the Board of Trustees (BOT) and other party stakeholders. “We have not zoned out the presidency to any part of Nigeria”, NAN quoted him as saying. “Anybody from anywhere in Nigeria is free to come and contest for the presidential seat in PRP.” The politician noted that what was paramount to the party “is someone who has integrity”. He said the PRP will develop a template for leadership positions including the presidency, governorship and the national assembly. Congresses have been held across states and the PDP is planning its national convention, Bello added. The leader disclosed that the platform was ready to join a strong alliance against the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
