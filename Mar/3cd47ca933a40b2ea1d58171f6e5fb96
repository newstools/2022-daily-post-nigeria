As former Governor of Kano State, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, prepares to dump the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP), the sacked Chairman of the Party, Hisham Habib, has threatened court action against the party executives. Kwankwaso had told reporters last weekend that he has concluded plans to dump the PDP for the NNPP. Recall that the outgoing National Secretary of the party, Ambassador Agbo Gilbert Major, disclosed on Tuesday that Kwankwaso will indeed make the move. However, after the announcement of Kwankwaso’s planned defection to NNPP, Habib welcomed the former senator, but said “no automatic tickets for new entrants.” The national headquarters of the NNPP had reportedly removed Hisham and appointed Umar Haruna Doguwa, Kwankwaso’s political disciple, as caretaker Chairman. This development did not go down well with Habib, who has threatened legal action against what he described as an “undemocratic siege on the party by the Kwankwaso led group Kwankwasiyya.” In a statement he signed yesterday, Habib described the appointment of Doguwa as caretaker chairman as a “siege” that baffled the party men and women. He also expressed concern that “partisan politics is endangered if politicians can wriggle parties from those who have toiled for a long time”. Hisham Habib maintained that the process has always been an all-inclusive one and that progress can only be made if negotiations encompass and reflect stakeholders. “The national leadership is aware of the challenges we faced for years while promoting the party, we deserve a better approach,” he said. On the next line of action, the ousted chairman said consultations are being made on the best way forward that may include seeking redress in court or parting ways with the party.
