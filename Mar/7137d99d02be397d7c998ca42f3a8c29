Manchester United midfielder, Nemanja Matic has admitted the atmosphere at the club is ‘not fantastic’ following a string of disappointing results. Before moving to Manchester United, Matic won two Premier League titles with Chelsea but has now crashed out of the Champions League. United have also lost ground on the top-four race with some below par performances. Matic, who has been at Old Trafford since 2017, spoke ahead of Saturday’s crunch clash with Leicester City. “The atmosphere? It depends on results. Of course, when you have good results the atmosphere is much better and everyone is happy,” he told talkSPORT. “As you know we are not in the best position in the league and the atmosphere is not fantastic, but we have to stay positive and believe until the end because we want to finish in that top-four. “The atmosphere in our dressing room will depend on that. If we finish top-four then it will be good for us, everyone will be… I cannot say happy, but satisfied. “If we don’t make that, it will be a very sad dressing room.” Speaking on claims that the United dressing room is unhappy with interim boss Rangnick, Matic insisted the squad is behind him. “He is an experienced coach,” Matic continued. “We work very hard to be honest with him.”
