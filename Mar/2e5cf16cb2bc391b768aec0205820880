No fewer than 12 persons have been burnt to death in an auto crash that occurred at Tsamawa Town, Garun Malam Local Government Area (LGA) of Kano State. This was contained in a press statement issued by the Public Relations Officer of the State Fire Service, Alhaji Saminu Abdullahi, on Tuesday. “We received a distress call from one Isah Mai-Fetur at about 3:00 pm that a commercial Hiace bus and another J5-bus had collided and instantly burst into flames. “Upon receiving the information, we quickly sent our rescue team to the scene at about 3:12 pm to rescue the victims,’’ the statement said. He said that the 11 persons in the Hiace bus were coming from Zaria road to Kano, while one person in the J5-bus was also going to Kano from Zaria. Abdullahi said that all the 12 persons were burnt beyond recognition, just as he attributed the accident to overspeeding. He also advised motorists to always drive carefully to avoid unforeseen circumstances.
