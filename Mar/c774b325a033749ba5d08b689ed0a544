Dotun Babayemi, an aspirant in Tuesday’s Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) gubernatorial primary election in Osun State has denied information making the rounds that he has withdrawn from the race. Confirming that he is very much in the race on the platform of the PDP, Babayemi stated that the reports remained in the figment of the imagination of the persons behind it. Speaking via a statement by his campaign organisation on Monday evening, Babayemi revealed that there was no way he could withdraw from the gubernatorial race a few hours after he was chosen by stakeholders in the party. According to the statement, “Our Principal has been receiving calls from his numerous admirers over a dubious report by some faceless individuals insinuating his (Babayemi) withdrawal from the gubernatorial primaries scheduled to hold a few hours away. “The said report remains in the figment of the imagination of the individuals behind such. “There is no way Omooba Dotun Babayemi will withdraw from the governorship race a few hours after he was chosen as the candidate by stakeholders in the party.” He advised party members to discountenance the report and to always cross-check facts about him from appropriate quarters. Meanwhile, another aspirant in the exercise, Sanya Omirin has withdrawn from the race. The reason for his withdrawal, DAILY POST gathered, is because Dotun Babayemi has been picked by party leaders who are members of the Wale Ojo faction to square up with Senator Ademola Adeleke who has the backing of the Sunday Bisi-led faction of the party in the State. DAILY POST had earlier reported that Akin Ogunbiyi, Dele Adeleke, Fatai Akinbade had all withdrawn from contesting in the gubernatorial election in favour of Dotun Babayemi, whose aspiration had been endorsed by party leaders in the State.
