Lagos Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has refuted reports on the purported appointment of Musiliu Akinsanya a.k.a. MC Oluomo. The National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) suspended him as the Lagos Chairman on Wednesday. On Thursday, the sanctioned leader announced that he and the state chapter were breaking away from the body. Oluomo urged Sanwo-Olu to appoint a Management Committee to oversee the operations of parks. On Friday, information emerged that Akinsanya has been named the head of Lagos Transport Parks and Garages Management Committee. Reacting, Gboyega Akosile, Sanwo-Olu’s Chief Press Secretary debunked the news. “Please disregard post(s) claiming that Gov @jidesanwoolu has appointed suspended Chairman of NURTW, MC Oluomo as GM, Lagos Transport Parks and Garages committee”, he tweeted. The spokesman noted that the statement by Information Commissioner, Gbenga Omotoso, remains the government’s position.
