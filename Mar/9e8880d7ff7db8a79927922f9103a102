Paris Saint-Germain President, Nasser Al-Khelaifi and sporting director Leonardo went in search of the referee after their 3-1 defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday night. The Ligue 1 top shots were furious with some of the decisions the referee took during the last-16 second leg clash. ESPN reports Al-Khelaifi and Leonardo had to be restrained by security officials. Karim Benzema scored a second-half hat trick, as Madrid overturned a 1-0 first leg deficit to progress to the quarterfinals 3-2 on aggregate. PSG felt that Benzema had fouled goalkeeper, Gianluigi Donnarumma before making it 1-1, after Kylian Mbappe had given the visitors the lead in the first half. Al-Khelaifi and Leonardo left the presidential box after the match shouting and describing the decision as “shameful”. They subsequently went in search of the referee’s dressing room. They were initially unable to find the officials, before locating the referee’s room and banging on their door. Security staff were required to diffuse the situation, with one source claiming they had “never seen club executives behave like that.”
