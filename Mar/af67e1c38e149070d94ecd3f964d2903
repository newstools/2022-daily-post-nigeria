Super Eagles winger, Ademola Lookman, has pinpointed three key attributes of the Black Stars of Ghana. Lookman said the Black Stars is a strong team, very competitive and physical. The Leicester City star said this ahead of Nigeria’s 2022 FIFA World Cup second-leg playoff against Ghana at the Moshood Abiola Stadium in Abuja on Tuesday. Recall that Nigeria held Ghana to a 0-0 draw in the first leg last Friday in Kumasi. “This is a special event, special moments, the expectations are high. For us, it’s about winning and giving our best in the match,” Lookman told CAFOnline. “Ghana is a strong team, very competitive and physical. We expect that but we’ll be ready.” The winner over the two legs between Nigeria and Ghana will qualify for the World Cup in Qatar later this year.
