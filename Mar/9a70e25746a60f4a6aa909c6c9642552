An object suspected to be an improvised explosives device (IED), was on Thursday discovered along the Shanono area of Rigasa community in Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna State. A source disclosed to DAILY POST in Kaduna that the device was concealed inside a bucket and dumped close to a stream by unknown persons around 6:30am on Thursday. Confirming the IED, Mustapha Alilu said the bucket which was kept in an isolated place, was sealed with sellotape which made the people nearby suspicious. He said because the bucket looked suspicious, a member of the community, immediately contacted the police and the DSS who sent the anti-bomb squad operatives to the area and disabled it. He added that as soon as it was disabled, it was discovered that wire was connected to the sealed bucket, as many residents gathered at the scene observing the object. Rigasa community had been in the news a few weeks ago, over the bomb blast near a POS operator. Kaduna Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Jalige Mohammed, confirmed the discovery.
