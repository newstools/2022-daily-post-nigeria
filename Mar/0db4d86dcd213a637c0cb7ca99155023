Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta has showered praise on Martin Odegaard following their 2-0 win over Leicester City on Sunday. Arteta described his performance as “terrific” as the Norwegian playmaker continued his rich vein of form with another influential display. Odegaard created six chances in the match, five of which came in the first half alone. That is the most chances created in the first half of a Premier League fixture by an Arsenal player since Mesut Ozil’s six against Everton in October 2017. “He was terrific again today, in every aspect of the game; what he had to do in defending, when we were high and deep; in build-up phases; in the final third, the way he understood and managed the game when he was needed. “He’s come a long way since his arrival. And he is showing great maturity and responsibility on the pitch and he makes the other players better,” Arteta said. The Gunners welcome Liverpool next to the Emirates on Wednesday.
