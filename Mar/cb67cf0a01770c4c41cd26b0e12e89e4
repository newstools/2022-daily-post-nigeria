Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, has said Arsenal are looking in “good shape” in the battle to finish in the Premier League top four. The Red Devils briefly claimed fourth position after a 3-2 win over Tottenham on Saturday evening. But less than 24 hours later, Arsenal reclaimed the spot after they beat Leicester City 2-0. The Gunners now have a one-point advantage on United and three outstanding games. Rangnick said: “In three weeks we have the next Premier League game against Leicester at home and we will still try to push and do everything to win our next games in the Premier League. “We are fully aware that we should not be dropping points anymore in any of the games. “Right now Arsenal are in good shape, they won again yesterday at home against Leicester. “So for us it’s clear we need to look after ourselves and make sure that we win all the next upcoming games in the Premier League. “But tomorrow it’s a different competition, it’s Champions League, and as I said I think everybody in the squad, everybody in the staff, are highly motivated and we cannot wait for the kick-off tomorrow.”
