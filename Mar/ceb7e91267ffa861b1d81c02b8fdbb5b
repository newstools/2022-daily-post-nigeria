Ex-Arsenal star, Paul Merson has insisted that Manchester City will still go on to win the Premier League. Merson was speaking on Sky Sports shortly after Liverpool beat the Gunners 2-0 on Wednesday night. The win moved Jurgen Klopp’s men to within one point close to the leaders, City. But Merson said: “They’re one point behind. I know they can go top if they beat Watford. This team [City] can reel off eight wins on the trot like that. “And I mean like that. And they can do it again. I’d rather be Man City at the moment, in my opinion. “They’ve [Liverpool] still got to go to the Etihad and I know Man City, they’re a proper football team. “If Liverpool turn up at the Etihad and play like they did in the first-half, that will be the end of that.”
