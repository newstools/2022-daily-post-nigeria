The Leader of Government Business in Ekiti State House of Assembly, Hon. Aribisogan Olugboyega has said that the emergence of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in the Ekiti gubernatorial contest is not a threat to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Speaking in Ikole Ekiti during a meeting with leaders and members of the APC on Saturday, the lawmaker said that the entry of the SDP into the gubernatorial contest will not affect the impending victory of the APC. According to him, the SDP is a political ambulance hired to rescue a political prostitute and his retinue of disgruntled followers. ”The Social Democratic Party (SDP) is a party of aggrieved and disgruntled former PDP members who are on a revenge mission. Its flagbearer is not a threat to the APC but a serious blow to the candidate of opposition PDP in Ekiti,” he said. Aribisogan described the SDP as “an emergency sympathetic undertaker that is coming without a clear cut manifesto or development agenda”, adding that “the party has no idea of its own but an inherited baggage of disillusioned PDP marauders who are desperately looking for ways to come back to pillage the economy of the State.” ”SDP came alive with an inherited baggage of frustrated and highly disillusioned former PDP members. “Its candidate, Chief Segun Oni is a troubled candidate who is being tossed around by political jobbers who want to use him to gain political ascendancy. “SDP has no idea of what is on ground in Ekiti. The party has no manifesto. All it has shown us is a war-wearied Engr Segun Oni and his overwhelmed coterie of jesters. “Few weeks into a major election, we are yet to hear from the SDP what it has in stock for Ekiti people . The party had just come out from its cocoon to parade a beleaguered candidate who is still living in euphoria of his past,” he claimed.
