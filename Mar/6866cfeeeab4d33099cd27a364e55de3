Miss Chidinma Ojukwu, who allegedly killed the Super TV CEO, Micheal Ataga, has been crowned “Miss Cell, 2022” at the Kirikiri correctional facility. Ojukwu, a 21-year-old student of the University of Lagos, who allegedly stabbed her victim to death in Lekki, Lagos in 2021, emerged Miss Cell 2022 in a beauty pageant organized at the correctional centre to mark the 2022 International Women’s Day. The National Spokesperson, Nigeria Correctional Service, Francis Enobore who confirmed the development to BBC Pidgin, said Ojukwu participated in the program like every other inmate.  According to her, to commemorate the 2022 International Women’s Day, there were some events held in the facility. “Some cell blocks presented drama while some organized beauty pageantry, so there were different events in each block and so many winners emerged. “Chidinma is also an inmate so we cannot stop her from participating just because of her case. Her own block did beauty pageantry. “The inmates had approached the officer in charge that they wanted to have a program to commemorate the International Women’s Day and their request was approved”.
