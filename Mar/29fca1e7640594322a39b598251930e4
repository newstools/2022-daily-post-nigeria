Popular Media personality, Toke Makinwa, has knocked those disrespecting and belittling her achievements as a celebrity. A Twitter user took to the app on Tuesday comparing Toke Makinwa to American reality TV star, Kim Kardashian. The user wrote, “Kim Kardashian is a reality TV star. And she’s a global brand, socialite, model, and businesswoman. Please tell me what Toke does?” Responding, Makinwa listing out her achievement asked Nigerians to stop disrespecting and belittling her. “I am sick of the disrespect, let me help you small. I’m a radio presenter, a television presenter, I have a pan African talk show, the biggest talk show on Tv with an African audience, Actor, Author, Vlogger, entrepreneur, and the list is endless. Nigerians should really stop disrespecting me. “I’m literally on my own lane and you lane ass sorry excuse called ‘Men’ who don’t have shit to offer but your Twitter fingers constantly belittle my achievements for conversations. If it’s easy, do it. Sometimes I gotta drop my crown and set you straight. Google is your friend.” Toke warned that she would not ignore those comments targeted at disrespecting her anymore because she built her brand from the ground. “Nobody should tell me to ignore cos ignoring these shitheads is what makes them run wild with imaginary stories. I’ve built my brand from the ground up and will not tolerate any disrespect from anyone,” she tweeted.
