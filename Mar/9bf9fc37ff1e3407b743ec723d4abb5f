A doctor working for the Confederation of African Football (CAF), Joseph Kabungo has died in Abuja. Kabungo was the doping officer for the Nigeria vs Ghana 2022 World Cup second leg play-off at the Moshood Abiola Stadium. However, the circumstances of his death has become a source of controversy. Kabungo, who is from Zambia, was said to have died shortly after the match on Tuesday. Some claim he died as a result of the stampede that occurred before the game. However, others insist it was the fans’ invasion of the pitch after the match that led to the doctor’s death. Neither officials of the Nigeria Football Federation nor CAF have confirmed the doctor’s death. But Kabungo’s family, the Zambia FA and the Government of Zambia has been informed. BBC journalist, Osasu Obayiuwana, tweeted: “Sad news: I understand that an official for the @NGSuperEagles vs @GhanaBlackstars match (not a referee or assistant referee) died in #Abuja today. “His name is Dr Joseph Kabungo from Zambia. He was on duty as Doping officer. He collapsed suddenly and died. Cause of death not confirmed yet. His family, the Zambia FA and the government of Zambia have been duly informed. “If the death of #Zambian doctor Dr Joseph Kabungo at the #Abuja stadium was caused by being attacked by the #Nigerian fans who invaded the pitch, after the @NGSuperEagles lost the @FIFAWorldCup ticket to @GhanaBlackstars, @thenff would be in terrible trouble with @FIFAcom.” The Super Eagles failed to qualify for the 2022 World Cup finals billed for Qatar after they could only draw 1-1 with the Black Stars of Ghana, losing out on away goals.
