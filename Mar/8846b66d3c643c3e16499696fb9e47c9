The Big Tent Coalition of Political Parties and the civil society want Nigeria to move from politics of ‘big men’ to politics of big ideas from 2023. NAN reports that they made the call at the Big Town Hall Meeting in Lagos on Saturday. The Convener, Prof Pat. Utomi said it was high time Nigeria is restored to its pride of place among the comity of nations. The former presidential candidate stressed that the nation must have a political class that adopts a simple life. “Our country must be healed from the damage of our recent history. We must build afresh,” he urged. “It is time we look through the windshield and not looking at the rear blue mirror. We are focusing on yesterday, we are getting away from tomorrow.” Utomi noted that Nigeria has enormous potential but is crippled by the kind of politics being played. “If Brazil can come back to life, Nigeria surely will surely up again. It is about what individuals can do to build a great new tomorrow.” The Centre for Values in Leadership (CVL) founder called for unity in order to respond to existential challenges. Senior Pastor, Trinity House Church, Pastor Ituah Ighodalo urged like-minds to converge and chart a new path for development. “We are looking for sincere people interested in Nigeria to come forward and offer themselves to play a role in whatever capacity. “Some of us will run for offices, some will support, some will fund, some will do the leg work. We will all work together.” Ighodalo said citizens must get it right in the 2023 general elections to build a country of everybody’s dream. Prof. Remi Sonaiya, the 2015 presidential candidate of the KOWA Party called for new ideas to restore Nigeria to the path of greatness. Others in attendance were Prof Bayo Olukoshi, Prof Leslye Obiorah, Prof Jibril Ibrahim, Prof Ugo Nwokeji, Prof Sam Guobadia, Dr Muiz Banire, Sir Tola Mobolurin, Charles Orbih, Dare Dairo, among others.
