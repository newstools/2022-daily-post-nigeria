Former Chelsea star, Glen Johnson has issued a warning to Antonio Rudiger that he would be making a mistake if he leaves the Blues to join Premier League rivals, Newcastle United in the summer. Johnson believes Rudiger should stay at Chelsea, adding that if he goes to Newcastle at the end of the season, it would be for the wrong reasons. Rudiger’s contract at Chelsea will expire at the end of the season and there has reportedly been no progress over an extension. The Germany international has been linked to Newcastle, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Man United, Juventus, among others, in the past. Speaking to BettingOdds, Johnson was asked about Rudiger’s contract situation and whether he thought it would be the right choice for the centre-back to join Newcastle, He said: “Yes, I do think it would be a mistake. Without being disrespectful, there would be only one reason why Antonio Rüdiger would be going to Newcastle. “I think he’s still got a lot to offer. If you are still fighting for titles and going deep in most competitions, why would you look to leave? He’s obviously earning good money now. “That will continue. No, if he goes to Newcastle right now, it would be for the wrong reasons.”
