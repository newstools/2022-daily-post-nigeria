A former Super Eagles coach, Christian Chukwu, has given his verdict on Nigeria’s 2022 FIFA World Cup playoff against the Black Stars of Ghana. Chukwu said he is optimistic about the Super Eagles qualification for the 2022 FIFA World Cup after their playoff fixture with the Black Stars of Ghana, adding that he has already started praying for the game. He told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Enugu on Wednesday that he was “highly hopeful” of victory for the Super Eagles at the end of the two-leg encounter. Nigeria and Ghana will clash on Friday at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi, while it will end on Tuesday at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium in Abuja. “I am optimistic of the national team’s victory. I am already praying and mobilizing local support for their victory,” Chukwu said. “I am of the belief that those around for the game will deliver for Nigeria. “But in a situation where some invited players do not make it, we must know that this is a sign that there is the need to groom and get home-based Super Eagles players ready to replace anybody in the squad.” Chukwu, who captained the team when it was the Green Eagles, said such a situation was an indication that the Super Eagles’ handlers should never neglect the home-based players. “There should be a development plan, as they (home-based players) may be so useful in times like these,” he said. Chukwu, however, challenged the team’s coaching crew to deploy a superior technical and tactical pattern of play as the Black Stars would definitely try to pull some surprises against the Super Eagles. He also said he was sure Nigerians would rise in full support of the team, as “they have been supporting the Super Eagles all along and they will do the same this time.”
