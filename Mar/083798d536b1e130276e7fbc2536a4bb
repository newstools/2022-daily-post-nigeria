Senator Rochas Okorocha has said he would grab the opportunity to run for the presidency if the possibility of a Tinubu and Rochas ticket emerged. Okorocha, a former Governor of Imo said this on Sunday while fielding questions from newsmen at the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Convention in Abuja, NAN reports. “Uncle Tinubu and I are most likely to be.
“I know that at the appropriate time it may be because he is the one pushing up in the south-west and I am in the south-east.
“So let us see what happens between us, and if that is it, I will ask him to relax a bit so that we can move this section forward. “The people naturally love me and I think it is because they believe I care, they believe I love and have sympathy for humanity, they believe I am detribalised. “They believe I do not know religion or tribe, Muslim Christian, Igbo or Hausa, Yoruba, all I see is a human being and that is what makes the difference on my side.’’ Okorocha urged Nigerians to use their voter cards well because it was worth much more than they thought. He added that 2023 would present an opportunity for Nigerians to make the right choices. “Whether it is for internal democracy or for general elections, you must ensure that you cast your vote right because the voter’s card contains everything. “It is the education of your children, it is your health, food on the table and security, so I always advise people that the worth of that card in your hand is more than N100 million so do not sell it for N10,000,’’ he said
