Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has said Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, is responsible for Chelsea sanctions. Klopp, addressing the media on Friday, insisted no employee at Stamford Bridge is to blame. On Thursday, the UK government froze the assets of Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich. The Blues are currently unable to sell any tickets or merchandise and cannot offer new contracts to players. Klopp has now agreed with the decision taken by the government. “I feel for him (Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel) and the players. It’s not a situation all the employees at Chelsea are responsible for,” he said. “One man is and that’s Putin. I don’t know about Roman Abramovich’s role in all this, but you can say he is close. I think what the Government did is right.”
