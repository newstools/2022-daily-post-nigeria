Former Premier League stars, Alan Shearer and Jermain Defoe have hit out at Tottenham Hotspur following their FA Cup exit at Middlesbrough. Middlesbrough eliminated Tottenham in the FA Cup fifth-round tie on Tuesday, thanks to Josh Coburn’s 107th-minute strike. Speaking on BBC after the game, Shearer said Antonio Conte’s men were flaky against Middlesbrough, while Defoe described their display against the Championship side as ‘disappointing.’ Shearer said, “This was no fluke. Spurs were so flaky, typical Tottenham. They [Middlesbrough] were the better team from start to finish. “They were first to every tackle; they created chances and had more energy. Certainly in extra-time, they made the better substitutions, and Chris Wilder can be extremely proud of what his team has achieved tonight.” On his part, Defoe added: “This is massively disappointing from a Tottenham point of view. No disrespect to Middlesbrough; you expect Tottenham to come here and dominate. Middlesbrough played with urgency and got stronger and stronger. Their younger players came on and made an impact.”
