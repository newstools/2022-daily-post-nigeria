Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara State, on Tuesday, commiserated with the labour unions and the family of the State Council of the Trade Union Congress (TUC) Chairman, Comrade Akinsola Akinwunmi, who died in the Kaduna train attack by bandits on Monday. Recall that at least eight corpses were recovered after the bloody attack on the Kaduna-bound train by bandits, while several passengers were injured and scores unaccounted for among the over 900 passengers on board. “I send our heartfelt condolences to the family of the trade union leader, as well as the labour communities in the State. It is my prayer to God to console all that mourns this fine gentleman at this very sad moment,” the condolence message by his Chief Press Secretary, Rafiu Ajakaye, stated in Ilorin on Tuesday evening. Governor Abdulrazaq also condoled with the families of all the other victims of the dastardly attack. He lamented that the tragic incident, like those before it, was an attack on all the people of Nigeria. “We are confident that the security agencies will not spare any resources to get the criminals behind it, as had been directed by the President. “Terrorism and terrorists will not defeat our collective resolve to live in peace and harmony. “We, therefore, urge the security agencies to do their best to rescue all the abductees alive, while the terrorists behind the incident are arrested and made to face the full weight of the law,” the condolence message added.
