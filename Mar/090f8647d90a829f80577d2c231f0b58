Anambra State Governor, Prof Chukwuma Soludo has said he is confident that he will not have any problems with his predecessor, Willie Obiano. Soludo’s comments followed questions on whether his government would follow the same trend as those of other governors, who usually run into trouble with their predecessors on the assumption of office. Appearing on AriseTV morning show on Tuesday, Soludo insisted that there was no room for such in his government. The former CBN governor said the reason most governors usually have problems with their successors is that some of them, even when out of government, want to determine what goes on in government. “What causes such problems is that some people, even when they are out of government, they want to be the ones to determine what happens in the government, without giving the governor the chance to run the government. “They want to determine who is where, and who gets what. And once these things begin to happen, there is bound to be a problem. “But Chief Willie Obiano is not that kind of man. I do not see him as that kind of man who will want to interfere. “He is a gentleman, an honourable man, and I give it to him. I mentioned him even in my inaugural speech, he is a man who stands by his words,” Soludo said. There have been insinuations that the governor, Prof. Soludo may have already fallen apart with his predecessor but Soludo in the programme rather praised Obiano for his forthrightness, and unwavering tenacity in standing by him, after they both accepted to work together, during Obiano’s reelection bid, while also working for his (Soludo’s) election last year.
