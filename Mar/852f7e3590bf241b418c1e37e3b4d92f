Former Chelsea star, Frank Leboeuf has snubbed the Blues while naming his three favourites clubs to win the UEFA Champions League this season. Chelsea won the Champions League last season under the guidance of Thomas Tuchel. The West London club looks set to qualify for the quarter-finals after beating Lille 2-0 in the round of 16 first-leg encounter last month. But Leboeuf believes Chelsea are not one of the favourites to lift the Champions League trophy this term, tipping Liverpool, Manchester City or Bayern Munich to be crowned the best team in Europe instead. Asked to name his favourites to win this season’s Champions League, Leboeuf told BritishGambler: “Liverpool, Man City or Bayern Munich.” He added, “Man City are dying to win the Champions League – I think if you asked every City fan if they would rather win the league or the Champions League, they would all say the Champions League. “I think that Liverpool can win the Champions League and you only have to look at their history in the competition.”
