President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on Saturday urged mothers of Russian soldiers to prevent their sons from being sent to war in Ukraine. Zelensky said Russian mothers should stop their sons from being killed or captured by preventing them from fighting Ukraine. Stressing that Ukraine never wanted the war, the President vowed that his country would defend itself. Addressing the country, Zelensky said: “I want to say this once again to Russian mothers, especially mothers of conscripts. Do not send your children to war in a foreign country. “Check where your son is. And if you have the slightest suspicion that your son could be sent to war against Ukraine, act immediately to prevent him from being killed or captured. “Ukraine never wanted this terrible war. But it will defend itself as much as necessary.”
