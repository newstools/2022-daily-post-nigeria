The Police in Isiokolo Division, Ethiope-East Local Government Area of Delta State have arrested a woman, Mercy Oba over an alleged assault on her forty-five-year-old blind step-sister, Odiri Oba and her twelve-year-old daughter. The suspect’s arrest was made possible by a Warri based human rights activist, Kelvin Ejumudo and his team. The Activist in his Facebook timeline alleged that the suspect also drove a wood into the private part of the twelve-year daughter of the blind woman and inflicted bodily injuries on her and the blind mother following severe beatings. He added that the suspect also chased the victims out of their house with their properties thrown out just as she threatened to kill them boasting that nothing would happen. Comrade Ejumudo said the matter will be charged to Court on Monday. Ejumudo, who tendered a Police medical report said, “Nobody has the monopoly of violence and to inflict bodily injuries on another individual.” He urged the Delta State Commissioner of Police, CP Ari Muhammed Ali to ensure that justice is served in the matter to serve as a deterrent to others. Blind Odiri Oba is an indigene of Emaje Village, Kokori Community in Ethiope-East Local Government Area and is a step-sister to the suspect, Mercy Oba. It was not clear at the time of this report, why the suspect who is currently in Police custody attacked her blind sister and her daughter.
