The Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Emmanuel, has sacked his honorary Special Adviser on Grassroots Mobilization, Elder Enefiok Ekefre. In a termination letter signed by the Permanent Secretary, Government House, Dr. Nathaniel Adiakpan, the reasons for his termination were not stated. According to the letter, “I am directed to inform you that with effect from 1st March, 2022, your services will no longer be required. With this letter, your offer of appointment as Honorary Special Adviser, Grassroots has been terminated”. Ekefre’s termination is coming barely two weeks after the Chief of staff to the Governor and former Commissioner of Works and Fire Service, Mr. Ephraim Inyang-yen was sacked. It has been speculated that Ekefre’s sack was due to his open support for the governorship aspiration of Senator Bassey Albert Akpan, one of the top contenders for the 2023 governorship position of the state. Reacting to his sack in an interview with newsmen in Uyo on Tuesday, Ekefre accused the governor of running a ‘vulture-like leadership’. His words, “You must have heard what I have said before that there are two sets of leadership in Akwa Ibom State and the two sets are those of the hen and the vulture. When the hen is scratching for food it will push the crumbs back and its children will pick from there, but the vulture is the one that will take away everything and go to the top of a tree and when it finishes, it comes back to pick another one. “I challenged Udom Emmanuel outside his family, let him point out anybody either Ibibio, Annang or Oron, that he has empowered.”
