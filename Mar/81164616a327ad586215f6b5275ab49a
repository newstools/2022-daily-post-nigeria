Accreditation of delegates to the All Progressives Congress (APC) 2022 National Convention has begun, as delegates from across the federation thronged Eagle Square, venue of the convention, amidst tight security. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reports that the New National Working Committee (NWC), members are expected to be elected at the convention, to manage the party’s affairs for the next four years. The party is currently being managed by a Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), headed by Gov. Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State. The Eagle Square, venue of the convention, located in the Central Business District, is already wearing a new look with different shades of decorations. Petty traders are taking advantage of the large number of party faithful, both at the party secretariat and the Eagle Square, to carry out brisk businesses as they hawk branded T-shirts, wrappers, hats, key holders, wristbands and other souvenirs. Heavy security presence has also been noticed, not just at the Eagle Square, but around the entrance to the venue. Most hotels in Abuja city centre, and even in the satellite towns, have been fully booked as early as a week before the convention.
