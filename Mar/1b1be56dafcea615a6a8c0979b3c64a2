Former Manchester United star Gary Neville believes Leeds United have taken a huge step towards escaping relegation from the Premier League after their remarkable comeback against Wolves on Friday. Neville believes the 3-2 win over Wolves will have a ‘massive impact’ on Leeds’ bid to stay in the Premier League next season. Leeds were 2-0 down at half-time at Molineux with Wolves firmly in control until Raul Jimenez was sent off after 53 minutes. Jack Harrison and Rodrigo both scored in an incredible three minute period before Luke Ayling lashed home a stoppage-time winner to seal a 3-2 win for the visitors. Neville believes Leeds have now given their survival hopes a huge boost with Watford, Burnley and Norwich occupying the bottom three. “I can’t believe what I’ve seen in that second half. The red card had a massive impact on the result, but they still had to go and score three goals. That’s a massive, massive night for Leeds United. “They know that because it takes them seven points clear. “For Watford and Burnley, oh my goodness me, that is incredible. “Football can shock us, the sending off had a huge impact but what a night that is for Leeds. “It is a big night, a massive night at the bottom of the table. It will have a big impact, that result.”
