The Chief Executive Officer, CEO, and Registrar of the National Examinations Council, NECO, Ibrahim Dantani, has revealed that the council requires over N2 billion to settle the allowances of its over 4,000 staff on examination duties. Wushishi made the disclosure while fielding questions from newsmen at the end of the opening of a workshop on Quality Assurance in Educational Assessment with the theme, “Invigorating and Repositioning the National Examinations Council, NECO, through the Instrumentality of Quality Assurance for Effective Service Delivery in Minna Niger State. He said soon, over 4,000 of its staff would be engaged on exams duties across the nation. He hinged the increase in the examination bills to the federal government’s recent upward review of Duty Traveling Allowances, DTA, of lts staff from N16, 000 to N33,500. Wushishi stated that NECO on its own does not have the money to implement such approval, while appealing to the Federal Government to come to its aid. Speaking on moves by the Federal Government to stop the collection of 25 per cent from NECO examination fees, the Registrar described it as a welcome development. He also explained that the workshop would equip participants with the required skills to compete favourably with their counterparts globally which as well will impact positively on the participants. According to him, “We need to install an e-library, sustainable training for capacity building, making available 24 hours free internet, use of softwares and computer laboratories as well as updating the knowledge of the teachers on their subject areas.” Wushishi further explained that his expectations at the end of the workshop include better handling of NECO exams, improveS knowledge capacity as well as improved efficiency and effectiveness of the staff.
