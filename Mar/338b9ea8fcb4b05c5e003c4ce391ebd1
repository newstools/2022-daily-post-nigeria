Shehu Sani, a former federal lawmaker, has suggested that former Nigeria international, Taribo West, should pray for the Super Eagles ahead of their 2022 FIFA World Cup second leg playoff against the Black Stars of Ghana. Nigeria will host Ghana on Tuesday in Abuja, having played a 0-0 draw in the first leg last Friday in Kumasi. The Super Eagles need a win against the Black Stars in order to qualify for the World Cup in Qatar later this year. Recall that West had come under heavy criticism for praying for former Lagos State governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu’s success ahead of the 2023 presidential election. West was caught on camera earlier this month praying fervently for Tinubu at his residence in Lagos State. DAILY POST had reported that Taribo is one of the former internationals invited for a novelty match to mark the All Progressives Congress, APC, national leader’s 70th birthday. Taribo participated in the match with the ex-Super Eagles players, led by Austin Jay Jay Okocha, defeating the Lagos team 2-0. However, in a tweet via his Twitter handle on Sunday, Sani wished he could nominate West to pray for Austine Eguavoen’s men ahead of the Ghana clash. He tweeted: “Nigeria plays Ghana on Tuesday; if I nominate Taribo West to pray for us, some of you will say no.”
