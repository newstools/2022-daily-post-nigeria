Italy-born defender, Calvin Ughelumba Bassey, has said that it is hard to breathe playing in Africa. Bassey said this while speaking on his debut for the Super Eagles of Nigeria. The Rangers left-back made his debut for Nigeria after coming off the bench in the Super Eagles’ goalless draw against the Black Stars of Ghana in a 2022 FIFA World Cup first leg playoff on Friday night in Kumasi. The Leicester City academy product was eligible to play for Nigeria, having been born in Italy to Nigerian parents but raised in England. However, Bassey became cap-tied to Nigeria after replacing Porto’s Zaidu Sanusi in the 74th minute during the encounter against Ghana at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi. “Obviously, we will get the win,” Bassey told Scottish Daily. “It was an honour to represent this great nation. “Playing in Africa is a lot more physical; it is just adjusting to the environment, the pitch, the weather, it is harder to breathe, so it is just adjusting to it.”
