China’s Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, has said that “time will prove that China’s position is on the right side of history” amid the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Wang Yi disclosed this on Sunday while speaking with reporters, according to a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “China will continue to make independent judgments based on the merits of the matter and in an objective and fair attitude. “We will never accept any external coercion and pressure, and we also oppose any groundless accusations and suspicions against China,” the statement added. Wang said, “The long-term solution is to abandon the Cold War mentality, refrain from engaging in group confrontation, and truly form a balanced, effective and sustainable regional security architecture. Only in this way can long-term stability on the European continent be achieved.” Recall that the war between Ukraine and Russia began in February. The war enters its twenty-third day today, with massive casualties already recorded. Russian President, Vladimir Putin had ordered the invasion of Ukraine over disagreements on some political issues. Putin had also listed some conditions to end the war.
