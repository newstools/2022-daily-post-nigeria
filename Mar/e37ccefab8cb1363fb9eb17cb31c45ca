Aisha Falode, President of the Nigeria Women Football League (NWFL), has said the Super Eagles players are willing to die on the pitch in tonight’s 2022 FIFA World Cup playoff against the Black Stars of Ghana at the Baba Yara Stadium, Kumasi. She said this in an interview with the team’s media officer at their training camp in Kumasi, where the Super Eagles will face Ghana. Falode also hailed the Minister of Sports, Sunday Dare, and the President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick, for providing Super Eagles with a five-star hotel. “We really must thank the President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick and the Honourable Minister of Sports for giving the Super Eagles and indeed all the national teams football this kind of an arrangement that is unprecedented. “They have travelled in star and accommodated in a five-star hotel and you must remember that once this place was named as the venue on Wednesday, on Thursday, Amaju Pinnick made sure he got some of us on a flight to come and pay a visit and value the facility. As a result of that visit, we can change the hotel from what was proposed before to a five-star hotel that we are in now. Of course, you can see the beautiful stadium, natural grass, good ambience and today we are going to have a packed stadium. “If you go outside the stadium, see the numbers of Nigerians, some of them tying the national flags on their waist. Some of them are waving it. It means that Nigerians will be here in Kumasi in their numbers today. The boys are willing to die on the pitch and deliver.” Meanwhile, after the match in Kumasi, the Super Eagles will host Ghana in the return leg in Abuja on Tuesday.
