The UK government will allow Roman Abramovich to sell Chelsea, only if none of the proceeds come to him. Abramovich was finally sanctioned on Thursday morning, with the government claiming that the Russian oligarch had been “involved in destabilising Ukraine and undermined and threatened the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine” via the steel manufacturing company Evraz PLC. Chelsea have been given a special license to continue operating, but cannot sell tickets and merchandise or conduct player transfers or contract negotiations. Abramovich had put the Blues up for sale last week with a asking price of £3billion, adding that the proceeds would go to “victims of the war in Ukraine”. That sale has been put on hold for the foreseeable future following the sanctions. However, the UK Telegraph reports the Russian billionaire can still proceed if he agrees to hand over the process to the government. The government would decide the value of the club, and where the funds from any deal will go.
