The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) has made a clarification on the number of persons onboard the NRC AK9 Abuja-Kaduna train. The train was attacked the night of Monday, March 28 at a location between Katari and Rijana. A statement on Thursday by Engr. Fidet Okhiria, NRC MD said inaccurate numbers of passengers were circulating. Okhiria noted that the corporation had 8 personnel and some security operatives attached to the train. He said every passenger is recognized via electronic validators linked to the central system. “398 passengers purchased tickets to travel on the NRC AK9 service, and 362 passengers actually boarded. “The entire seat capacity of the train in question is 840 passengers. Therefore, the figure of 970 being circulated cannot be correct.” Okhiria explained that the AK9 service was the last out of Abuja that Monday and is usually at less than half capacity. Passengers on board, he added, have confirmed that the train was certainly not run at full capacity. The NRC said it is continuing efforts to reach out to passengers using the comprehensive manifest in order to obtain information about their present condition The statement prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured passengers and for families of the bereaved fortitude to bear the loss.
