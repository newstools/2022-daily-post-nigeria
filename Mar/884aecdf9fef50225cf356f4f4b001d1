Japan and South Korea have issued travel bans to Russia following the ongoing war. While South Koreans are warned not to travel to areas in Russia and Belarus bordering Ukraine, Japan raised its alert level for Russia and urged nationals not to travel there at all. South Korea banned its nationals from traveling to areas in Russia and Belarus that share borders with Ukraine, the country’s Foreign Affairs Ministry said Sunday, according to CNN. The ban, according to the ministry, takes effect from today, Monday March 7, 2022 any national of South Korea, who disobeys the ban and travels to countries or regions under a Level 4 alert, can be punished under related laws, the statement added. Also Japan’s Foreign Ministry raised its travel advisory for Russia on Monday and urged its nationals to stay away from Russia completely. Those already in Russia are advised to “consider leaving the country by commercial flights, keeping in mind that ways to leave the country will be further restricted in the future.” The ministry raised its risk warning for Russia to Level 3 out of four levels.
