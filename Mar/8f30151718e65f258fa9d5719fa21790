Manchester United’s board is split over who to appoint as next manager in the summer, with Mauricio Pochettino and Erik ten Hag dividing opinions. Sky Sports reports that there is a split in Man United’s board over who to pick when Ralf Rangnick finally leaves Old Trafford at the end of the season. Recall that Man United appointed Rangnick to temporarily take charge of the first team for the remainder of the current campaign. The Red Devils are currently doing background checks on candidates and they have whittled their list down to four names; Pochettino, Ten Hag, Luis Enrique and Julen Lopetegui. Pochettino and Ten Hag are currently leading the race even though Enrique and Lopetegui are candidates. Pochettino is currently the manager of Paris Saint-Germain, while Ten Hag is the head coach of Ajax. However, Man United’s board are therefore unsure which direction to go in, with a split among officials as to who is a better fit for Old Trafford between both men.
