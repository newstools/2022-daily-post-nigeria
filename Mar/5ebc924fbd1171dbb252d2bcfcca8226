My name is Kanayo O. Kanayo, I’m an actor and a lawyer, and I hold a national honour as a member of the Order of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “Sir, on this occasion of my 60th birthday, I want to make an appeal to you as a son and a patriotic citizen whose industry contributes meaningfully to the Nation’s GDP. “I’m deeply pained by the loss of lives, wanton killings and general insecurity in the land. “You’re the father of the nation with numerous sons and daughters including Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Sir, the bulk stops at your table, I know and appreciate that Nnamdi Kanu’s case is before the court and you usually do not like to interfere with court cases but at this stage of heightened tension, you are a president with executive powers. “My appeal sir, biko (Please)release Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, it is my 60th birthday appeal. Thank you sir.”
