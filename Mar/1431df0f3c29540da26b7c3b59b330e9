Former head coach of Nigeria, Gernot Rohr, has reacted to the furore created by current handler, Augustine Eguavoen’s admission that he included certain players in his latest squad to appease some bigwigs in the Nigeria Football Federation. Rohr, speaking with ESPN, made it clear that the topshots at the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) couldn’t influence his decision. Eguavoen unveiled a 32-man squad to face Ghana in the 2022 World Cup playoffs, with seven of them on standby. Two players whose inclusion caused an uproar are Watford’s Oghenekaro Etebo and Ogenyi Onazi. Onazi was without a club after leaving Turkish second division side Denizlispor in December, before he joined Saudi Arabia’s Al Adalah. The defensive midfielder is yet to make his debut for the Knights of the Oasis. Eguavoen then admitted that he included the ex-Lazio star to “pacify everybody”. Rohr has now hinted that certain people attempted to influence his team selection while he was in charge. He said: “It is not the moment to speak about the ‘advice’ I got from them about which players we can invite for the national team because I want the players to focus and go to the World Cup. “But they couldn’t influence my decisions.”
