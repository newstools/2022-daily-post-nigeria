The United Kingdom (UK), on Thursday, announced sanctions on two more Russian oligarchs, Igor Shuvalov and Alisher Usmanov, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, BBC reports. Shuvalov was formerly Russian President Vladimir Putin’s deputy prime minister, while Usmanov previously had sponsorship ties to Everton and Arsenal football clubs. Under the UK government’s new restrictions, Shuvalov and Usmanov’s assets will be frozen and the pair will be banned from travelling to the UK. Also, British citizens and businesses will not be allowed to deal with them. Recall that the European Union (EU) had frozen the assets of Usmanov earlier this week. According to the EU, Usmanov was “a pro-Kremlin oligarch with particularly close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.” Responding to the EU’s decision, Usmanov made a statement at the time, calling the EU’s decision to impose restrictions on him “unfair,” adding that he would “use all legal means to protect his honour and reputation.”
