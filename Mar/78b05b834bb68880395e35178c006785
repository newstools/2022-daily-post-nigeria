Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola has said they are not afraid of facing another Premier League club in the Champions League quarter-finals. The champions have been knocked out by an English team in three of the last four campaigns. City sealed their spot in the last eight, with a 5-0 aggregate win over Sporting Lisbon, following a 0-0 draw at home on Wednesday night. Liverpool will also be in the hat for the draw on March 18 and could be joined by Manchester United and Chelsea. When asked if he wanted to avoid the other English teams, Guardiola said: “I would say no. “It’s difficult for us and them too and for opponents from other countries. “We are in the last eight and we’ll prepare well and next Friday we’ll see the draw. It’s an honour as important teams are out.”
