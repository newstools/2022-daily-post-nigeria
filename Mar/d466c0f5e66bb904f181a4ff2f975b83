Romelu Lukaku and Hakim Ziyech scored for Chelsea as they beat Middlesbrough 2-0 to qualify for the semi-final of the FA Cup. The win ended the Championship club’s remarkable run in the competition. Middlesbrough had eliminated Manchester United on penalties in the fourth round and scored an extra-time winner to defeat Tottenham Hotspur in the fifth round. However, Chris Wilder’s side came unstuck against Chelsea on Saturday. Romelu Lukaku tapped into an empty net on 15 minutes to help Chelsea to an early lead before Hakim Ziyech doubled their advantage with a superb finish from the edge of the 18-yard box. Thomas Tuchel’s men go into the international break on the back of a 13-game unbeaten run from January.
