Social Democratic Party, SDP, Osun State chapter on Saturday, hold its Governorship primary election. The party said the result of the primary has been submitted to the National Working Committee of the party while the party could not announce the result at the venue due to the presence of “dangerous and volatile invasion of the venue by unaccredited persons”. Election Committee Chairman, Barr. Joseph Achilles Abu, debunked purported governorship primary election results circulating in social media on Saturday. The party said the primary result was not announced after the conduct describing the purported result as fake. Election Committee Chairman in a statement noted that the party conducted its primary for Osun gubernatorial on Saturday. The chairman of the election committee further stated that the result was announced at the venue, even though the conduct was smooth but due to the dangerous and volatile invasion of the venue by unaccredited persons and non-members of the SDP. “Fortunately, the breach of security did not affect the conduct or outcome of the exercise which was conducted in line with the Approved Guidelines and the Constitution of the SDP. Abu said that a report of the primary has been submitted to the National Working Committee of the party which contains the actual results of the primary election conducted at the venue in the presence of INEC officials. “The national leadership of the party will brief the public on further details shortly. “In the meantime, the general public is advised to disregard any false reports and fake results issued in the name of the Committee. The false report in circulation did not emanate from me or any member of the Osun State Governorship Primary Committee and is, therefore, null and void,” the statement said.
