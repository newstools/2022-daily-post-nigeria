Former CNN presenter, Piers Morgan, has revealed what Manchester United forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, texted him after being asked what he thinks makes him the greatest of all time. Ronaldo netted a hat-trick in a 3-2 win over Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford on Saturday. The three goals saw him become the highest goalscorer in the history of the game as certified by FIFA. “Today, I texted him to ask him to sum up in one word why he’s the GOAT. “‘I need three words,’ he replied. ‘More than special one, I’m ‘The Only One.’ “Then he sent two laughing emojis. I could almost hear him chuckling – and winking – out of my phone. But he’s right,” Morgan wrote in his column for The Sun.
