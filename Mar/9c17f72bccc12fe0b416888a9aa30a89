The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arraigned a banker Judith Nneka Nwagwu for alleged fraud. She was docked before Justice D. A. Onyefulu of the Anambra State High Court in Onitsha, Anambra State. Nwagwu faces a seven-count charge bordering on forgery and obtaining by false pretence to the tune of N452,047,000. The defendant allegedly obtained N192,000,000 from a complainant whom she was his account officer. Nwagwu had claimed that the bank had $400,000 for sale at the rate of N480 per dollar. Her employers petitioned the EFCC alleging that she forged two fixed deposit certificates and fraudulently obtained N260,047,000 from a customer under the guise of fixing the money for him. In count 6 of the charge, Nwagwu, sometime in 2021 made a “false document titled ‘Malaexchio Global Limited’ with the value of N141,347,289”. The offence violates Section 436 of the Criminal Code Law, Cap 36, Anambra and punishable under Section 444(3)(h) of the same law. Nwagwu pleaded not guilty when the charges were read. Prosecution counsel Michal Ani requested a date for the commencement of trial. Justice Onyefulu granted bail in the sum of N10million with a surety in like sum, who must be resident within the jurisdiction of court. The judge adjourned the matter until May 11, 26 and June 8, 2022 for trial.
