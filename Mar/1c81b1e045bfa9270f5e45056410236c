The National Leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has been reminded that no one knows tomorrow. A former presidential aide, Reno Omokri wants the former Lagos State Governor to understand that no one can predict the future. Omokri, who worked with former President Goodluck Jonathan, wondered how Tinubu could be too sure and speak so boastfully and confidently of becoming the next President of Nigeria. DAILY POST reported earlier that Tinubu had boasted that he will rule Nigeria for eight years when he takes over from President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023, and then hand over to a smart politician with the largest number of followers. Tinubu, a presidential aspirant within the APC, said this in Akure, the Ondo State capital on Friday night, during his presidential consultations with traditional rulers in the State. There, the former Lagos Governor also maintained that if he becomes the president in 2023, he will turn around the country for good. Tinubu, one of those that installed the present administration, admitted that the country was yet to attain her greatness, promising not only to ensure massive job opportunities for Nigerian youths, but also establishment of industries across the country And Omokri sees this as boastful and taking the position of God. He feels it is unacceptable for a mere mortal to be too sure of what tomorrow has in place. Quoting the foremost APC chieftain, Omokri tweeted, “Tinubu said ‘When I rule for eight years, I will hand over to the smartest and someone with most followers.'” Then he wondered, “Is Tinubu God? See how he talks as if the Presidency is his for 8 years for the taking. Our votes don’t matter? Does he even know who will be alive tomorrow?”
