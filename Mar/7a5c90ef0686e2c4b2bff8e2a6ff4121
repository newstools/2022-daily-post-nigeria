Rasaq Adejumo, a former Odo-Otin local government area council chairman is the flagbearer of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in preparation for the Saturday, July 16, gubernatorial election in Osun State. He was declared the winner in the party’s primary election which was held on Saturday, March 12, 2022, in Osogbo by polling 55 votes against his close contestant, Architect Goke Omigbodun who polled 45 votes to emerge runner up. The election result was announced by the Secretary of the Committee, Oladele Ogunbameru. His emergence came after a keenly contested election which was conducted under the supervision of officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the watchful eyes of personnel of the Department of State Security (DSS) and the Nigerian police and other security agencies. Meanwhile, Busuyi Ayowole has emerged the gubernatorial candidate of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) in Osun state. Declaring him the winner of the primaries, Haruna Buhari, the Chairman of the Osun State PRP gubernatorial primaries who doubles as the National Treasurer of the party said Ayowole scored the highest number of votes as the sole aspirant of the party. Speaking after polling 71 votes to emerge as the flagbearer of the party for the July polls, Ayowole asked the state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola to start preparing his handover note. Emphasising that he has what it takes to govern the state, Ayowole said the ineptitude of the past leaders made it impossible for the state to progress. He revealed that he is coming with lofty ideas on how best to move the state forward because his party is well-positioned to take over the mantle of leadership of the state. In his words, “I want to say it emphatically that our party, The Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) is ready to rescue our dear state from the misgovernance of the ruling APC. By the special grace of God, I am winning the election.”
