Founding National Chairman of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Chekwas Okorie, has identified a major threat to the pursuit of Igbo presidency in 2023. Okorie said the presidential ambitions of Bola Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar possess threats to Igbos 2023 presidency. He expressed doubt over an Igbo man clinching the presidential ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and the All Progressives Congress, APC, with Tinubu and Atiku still in the race. Okorie explained that members of the parties from the southeast are not major stakeholders. “It is not looking good for us in the South East with Atiku and Tinubu and even someone like the Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, declaring their interests to contest for the office while the Igbo dream about having their turn. “Political parties are owned by certain individuals who in turn invite members of the public to join in order to win elections and I do not see any Igbo man in APC or PDP belonging to the core stakeholders’ forum of any of them,” he told reporters on Monday in Abuja.
