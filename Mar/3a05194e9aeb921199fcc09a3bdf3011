Super Eagles’ central defender, Leon Balogun, went into the dressing room of the Black Stars to congratulate them after Nigeria failed to qualify for the 2022 World Cup on Tuesday. Ghana qualified on away rule after Nigeria failed to score in Kumasi with the second leg ending 1-1 in Abuja. Ghanaian players had first comforted the Rangers defender after the final whistle as he laid down on the turf, burying his face in his hands. But the disappointment of missing out on the World Cup did not stop Balogun from visiting the Black Stars players in their dressing room. The Ghana Football Association, GFA, uploaded a video on their official YouTube page showing how Balogun went to their dressing room shaking the hands of the Black Stars players and officials.
