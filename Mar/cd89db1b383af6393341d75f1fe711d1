Nigerians have been charged not to take the back seat in choosing their leaders especially the president in the 2023 general election. Ide Owodiong Idemeko, the international president of 1001+voices gave the charge in a keynote address presented at a National Townhall meeting. Idemeko noted that following the situation of things in Nigeria, it has become expedient that the people should carefully identify leaders who are experienced, competent, bold and can confidently chart the course of a new Nigeria. He, however, attributed the cause of underdevelopment in Nigeria to bad leadership and governance urging the people to use the forthcoming 2023 elections to bring in a new government. While lamenting the level of hardship and difficulty the people have gone through in the past seven years in Nigeria, Idemeko said, “It is therefore imperative that we open our eyes and identify leaders who are experienced, competent, bold and can confidently chart the course of a new Nigeria by reaching out to all segments of our country to achieve an inclusive and collaborative approach to the myriad of problems facing us as a country and a people.” Calling on unity in the country, Idemeko noted that Nigeria will not make any progress if the people refuse to come together saying that upholding justice and equity will help leaders to achieve that.
