Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, says he has not asked Cristiano Ronaldo if he is happy at the club. The German was answering questions over Ronaldo’s body language at the club recently, amid speculations he could be looking to move on this summer. Rangnick said: “I don’t know, I’ve not asked him if he’s happy. “For me, it’s important he’s fit again. We will see with which formation and lineup we will play tomorrow.” Rather than travel to support his teammates against Manchester City last weekend, Ronaldo flew to his native Portugal for some mid-season rest. His actions caused an uproar among fans and observers. The 37-year-old is, however, fit for Saturday’s home fixture against Tottenham. “He resumed training yesterday, trained the whole day yesterday, he trained well like the rest of the day. I would have thought he would be available tomorrow,” Rangnick added.
