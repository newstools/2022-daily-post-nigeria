Former Nigeria’s Head of State and elder statesman, Gen. Yakubu Gowon, on Friday challenged Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State to ensure that he leaves a meaningful legacy that the incoming administration in 2023 will consolidate on. He also called on the Federal Government to refund monies used in constructing federal roads across the state, so it can be rechanneled into other sectors. Gowon made the request in Jos, the State Capital. “I want to appeal to the Federal Government to refund funds that the state used in constructing federal roads so that such funds will be used to intervene in other sectors in the state”, he maintained. In his remarks, Lalong said, “You will recall that when we were elected into office in 2015, we vowed to leave Plateau State better than we met it. “In particular, I emphasised that we will not abandon inherited projects, especially those which have a direct bearing on the lives of the people because doing the contrary will amount to waste of public funds.
