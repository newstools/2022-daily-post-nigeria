Lagos House of Assembly says there should be no contention over the steps taken by the government regarding the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) crisis. Temitope Adewale, Chairman, House Committee on Transportation made the position of the legislature known on Friday. He said the legislative arm has been proactive and already created the Lagos State Parking Authority, which would now oversee activities at all parks. Adewale noted that the House was aware of developments in the transportation union and the suspension of NURTW activities in Lagos. “It is clear to state that all parks, garages and parking activities would be under the Lagos State Parking Authority as stipulated by law.” “The Authority has a General Manager on whose shoulders the responsibility now falls to manage the parks at the moment.” The chairman advised Lagosians to be calm, adding that the government was exploiting necessary actions. The House assured that the authorities were resolute to avoid a breakdown of law and order in the state. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has denied appointing the suspended NURTW Chairman, Musiliu Akinsanya alias MC Oluomo as General Manager of Transport Parks and Garages Committee.
