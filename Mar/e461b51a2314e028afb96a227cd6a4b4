President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered security agencies to go after cultists terrorizing Ogun State. The President condemned the murders, kidnappings and sexual assault by rival gangs in recent days. Clashes between the Eiye and Aiye Confraternities have led to many deaths, including key leaders of both groups. Presidential spokesman Garba Shehu said Buhari was worried about reports of renewed cult violence, with Ogun as the new battlefront. “The police and other law enforcement agencies must confront head on, groups seeking to destroy peace and bring disorder before they gain strength”, Buhari ordered. “What should frighten us is that the deadly cult groups are increasingly attracting lonely, anxious, troubled youth who they trap in unorthodox social practices.” The presidency urged parents and religious leaders to come to grasp what is going on and halt the radicalization of youths.
