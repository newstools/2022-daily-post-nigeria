The stakeholders of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Zone one, Kaduna State, on Tuesday, pleaded with Governor Nasir El-Rufai to allow the zone produce the next governor in 2023. They lamented that despite their enormous contributions to the growth of the party in the State, their zone had been marginalized when it comes to appointments into public offices, among others. Leaders of the group, Ahmed Yahaya Lere and Usman Ahmed Danbaba, in a statement on Tuesday, in Kaduna, boasted that their zone is the backbone of the APC in Kaduna, going by their consistent performance in all previous elections of 2015 and 2019 and the recent local government elections. According to them, currently, their zone has a Senator, six members of the House of Representatives, eleven members of the State Assembly and seven council chairmen. “It is known to everyone that our zone is the strongest in the State, yet, in the history of APC, none of the Governor, Deputy Governor, the two Ministers, Party Chairman, Party Secretary, Women Leader, Youth Leader or the State representative at the national APC is from the zone. “Yet, the performance of the party, especially in zone 2 has been declining. “Some of us here were State and Zonal party executives, returning agents of the party, former government officials and contestants, but most importantly, we are genuinely concerned about the future of the party and consolidating on the gains made by the administration of Mallam Nasir Ahmed El-Rufai,” they stated. They added that, “for the future of our great party, the APC, we believe that our views and stands on the forthcoming party primary election of our great party should be listened to and respected, in particular, as it affects the choice of a predecessor to our leader, Malam Nasir El-rufai.”
