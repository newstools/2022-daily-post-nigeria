A dusk to dawn curfew has been imposed on Takum Local Government Council of Taraba State and its environs. Declaring the curfew on Saturday, the council chairman, Shiban Tikari, said the action has become necessary in order to prevent the ongoing crisis in the area from escalating. Upheaval necessitated by the kuchicheb, an annual festival of the Kuteb ethnic group in the state, was observed to have erupted in the council on Friday. The peaceful festival, which turned out to be bloody, was also confirmed to have led to the killing of no fewer than two persons , with varying degrees of injuries inflicted on several others. Determined to prevent the crisis from spreading to neighboring communities, the chairman, in a statement, said “after due consultations with the security agencies, I have decided to declare a dusk to dawn curfew on Takum and its environs with immediate effect.” Stressing that the enforcement of the curfew was necessitated by the crisis that erupted in the area Friday evening, security agencies, as stated by him have been “directed to arrest anyone found breaking the law.” Some of the eyewitnesses who spoke to DAILY POST, said the crisis would have been more bloody but for the swift intervention of security personnel. Narrating how the festival was almost hijacked by hoodlums, some persons from the council who spoke with DAILY POST, urged the government to alway make adequate security arrangements before allowing for the celebration of any festival in the state.
