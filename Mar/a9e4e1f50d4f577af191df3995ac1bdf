Real Madrid president, Florentino Perez, has reportedly ordered manager, Carlo Ancelotti, not to play winger Gareth Bale again, according to Nacional. Perez was left fuming by Bale’s unprofessionalism and has instructed Ancelotti not to play the Welsh international again. Bale was not available for selection in Sunday’s LaLiga El Clasico 4-0 defeat against Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabeu. After the game, Ancelotti confirmed that Bale’s absence was because of back pain. However, on Monday, Bale left Real Madrid to join up with Wales ahead of their 2022 FIFA World Cup playoff semi-final against Austria, infuriating Perez. The report claimed that Perez was left far from amused due to the fact that Bale did not play for the Los Blancos but was immediately available for selection for his country which made him very angry. As a result, Perez has now supposedly ordered Ancelotti to keep the former Tottenham Hotspur star on the bench till the end of the season. Bale has played just 270 minutes across all competitions for Real Madrid this season, scoring once.
