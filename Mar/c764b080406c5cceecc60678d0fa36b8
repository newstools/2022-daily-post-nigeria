Nigeria host Ghana in the second leg of their 2022 World Cup playoffs on Tuesday. The Super Eagles would need to be at their attacking best to get the ticket up for grabs, as a draw will not be enough. DAILY POST predicts the starting XI Augustine Eguavoen is likely to put out at the Moshood Abiola Stadium later this evening. Francis Uzoho will almost definitely continue in goal for Nigeria, as he was the team’s best player last Friday. He will have ‘Oyinbo Wall’ of captain William Troost-Ekong and Leon Balogun again in front of him in central defence. The fullback positions will be taken by Ola Aina and Calvin Bassey, who might edge out Zaidu Sanusi. In midfield, Eguavoen will probably go with the trio of Joe Aribo, Etebo Oghenekaro and Frank Onyeka, with Kelechi Iheanacho missing out Upfront, Osimhen and Simon Moses definitely start, while the right flank will probably go to Ahmed Musa or Emmanuel Dennis.
