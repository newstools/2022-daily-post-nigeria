Kurt Okraku, the President of the Ghana Football Association (GFA), has hit out at Super Eagles of Nigeria, describing them as “little babies” who pretend to be big boys. Nigeria and Ghana will battle in a double-leg 2022 FIFA World Cup playoffs. The first leg will take place at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi on Friday, while the second leg will take place at Moshood Abiola National Stadium Abuja on Tuesday. “It’s that time of the year where every Ghanaian will have to stand up and be counted. It’s that time of the year where our country’s pride is at stake,” Okraku told Joy Sports. “It’s that time of the year where Ghana must be at the Mundial, but before we do that, we have a common foe, the Super Eagles of Nigeria. They come across as our little babies, but they pretend to be the big boys,” he said. Meanwhile, Ghana holds a better head-to-head record over Nigeria and has not lost to the Super Eagles in over 16 years.
