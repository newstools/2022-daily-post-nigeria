Justice Adeyemi Fasanmi of the Ondo State High Court has withdrawn from a murder and arson case over allegations of bais. Five people had been charged with the murder of certain relatives of the Ajagunode of Ode Community, Akure North Local Government, Oba Sunday Adewole Boboye. Justice Fasanmi had ruled and granted bail to the five defendants, who were charged with a total of six counts, including conspiracy, intentional damage, arson and murder, pending the outcome of their trial. The five defendants from Isinigbo village were Ajayi Samson, Kole Omojowo, Oluwole Karimu, Akinsulu Mayowa, and Lucky William. The defendants were then granted bail in the sum of N5 million by the Presiding Judge, Fasanmi, along with other conditions that must be completed and met within 10 days. The king, however, who was enraged by the decision, accused the judge of being biased and indulgent with the defendants. The monarch told the court that he had petitioned the state’s Chief Judge for the case to be transferred, and that he had also petitioned the police to inform them of the continuous attack by the suspect in the community.
