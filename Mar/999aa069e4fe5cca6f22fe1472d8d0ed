Two men have been arrested in Ogun State for allegedly gang-raping a 22-year-old girl at the Eleweran area of Abeokuta, the state capital. The suspects, Seun Orokunle (38 years) and Sarumi Sodiq (28 years), were arrested following a report at the Public Complaint Bureau unit at the State police headquarters, Eleweran, Abeokuta by the victim. The victim had told the police that she had gone to visit Seun Orokunle, her boyfriend when she was gang-raped. The Ogun State Police Spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, told newsmen on Thursday that when the girl got to her boyfriend’s residence, “she went to the bathroom to take her bath, but unknown to her that the said Seun Orokunle has invited his friend, Sarumi Sodiq, who came straight to meet her in the bathroom, dragged her out and the two of them took turns to have sex with her after beating her thoroughly.” According to Oyeyemi, after the duo had satisfied themselves, Seun Orokunle dipped her clothes in a bucket of water to prevent her from leaving the house immediately. Oyeyemi quoted the victim as saying that the suspects while claiming to be cultists, threatened to kill her if she dared report the incident to anyone. Upon the report, the officer-in-charge of the Public Complaint Bureau, DSP Badmus Opeyemi, mobilised his men to go after the two suspects, who were eventually apprehended at the Aregbe area of Abeokuta. “They have both confessed to the commission of the crime,” the police spokesman stated, adding that the Commissioner of Police in Ogun, Lanre Bankole, has ordered that the two should be immediately transferred to the state CIID for further investigation and diligent prosecution.
