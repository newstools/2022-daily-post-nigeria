Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has insisted that his team face a ‘big challenge’ after drawing Real Madrid in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Chelsea was on Friday paired against Real Madrid when the quarter-finals draw was conducted. The Blues had qualified for the Champions League last-8 after eliminating Lille, while Real Madrid knocked Paris Saint-Germain out of the competition. Reacting to the draw, Tuchel, during his pre-match press conference on Friday ahead of Chelsea’s FA Cup tie with Middlesbrough on Saturday said, “Tough one. The challenge cannot be much higher than playing a second leg in the Bernabeu with spectators. “It’s a big challenge, but there is big excitement around this match and around this fixture. We know what’s coming. It will be an exciting match and a tough challenge. “It’s nice to play a European team and maybe not at this kind of stage a team you’ve played so many times in domestic competitions.” Elsewhere in the Champions League last-8 draw, Man City will face Atletico Madrid, Liverpool will take on Benfica, while Bayern Munich will clash with Unai Emery’s Villarreal.
