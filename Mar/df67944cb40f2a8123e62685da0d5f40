Manchester United football director, John Murtough, has said a “thorough process” is underway to find their next permanent manager as they look to start challenging for “top trophies” again. This season has been another challenging campaign for Man United, with a top-four finish, the best the Red Devils can hope for in the Premier League and the UEFA Champions League remaining their only route to silverware this term. Man United have been working under interim manager Ralf Rangnick since last December. The German gaffer succeeded Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after a poor start to the season. “We know that consistency is key as we strive for a top-four finish this season,” Murtough was quoted by Man United’s official website as saying on Tuesday. “I want to reiterate, however, that this isn’t the ultimate objective for Manchester United, and everyone at the club is focused on challenging for the top trophies. “We are now conducting a thorough process for the appointment of a new permanent manager who will take charge this summer, with the objective to get us back to challenging for those domestic and European titles.”
