Barcelona defender, Jordi Alba, has welcomed Paris Saint-Germain’s Lionel Messi back to the Catalan club. Alba admitted that he suffered a lot when Messi, who he described as the best player in the world, left Barcelona for PSG. DAILY POST reports that Messi left his boyhood club Barcelona last summer to join PSG on a free transfer after the Spanish LaLiga giants were unable to renew his contract. However, the seven-time Ballon d’ Or winner has not really impressed since joining PSG and was recently booed by the club’s fans following their elimination from the Champions League at the hands of Real Madrid in the last-16 stage. Speaking with El Larguero, Alba said it would be great if Messi returned back to Barcelona at the end of the season because his move to PSG cost him a lot and also the Barça fans. “Messi is the best player I have ever met. It would be great if he came back to Barça,” Alba said. “I suffered a lot when he left. Yes, I want to play with him again, but here at Barça, not at PSG.” “Leaving to PSG after a full life at Barcelona cost Messi a lot and also the Barça fans, but it’s football. It is hard to see him in another shirt, but he’s still the best in the world. He’s got a lot of football left and I am sure next year he will be much better and I am not saying this because he is my friend,” he added.
