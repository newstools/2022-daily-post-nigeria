The Director-General of the National Institute for Legislative and Democratic Studies (NILDS), Prof. Abubakar Sulaiman Monday said the Institute was set to produce a high turnover of lawmakers in the country. He stated this on the sidelines of a capacity building workshop for the Non-Academic Staff of the Institute. He noted that such a challenge is what the Institute is created to confront from time to time in terms of training. “As the 2023 general elections are approaching, there is the high possibility of high turnover of Federal lawmakers at the National Assembly as it has been the case since 2003, which NILDS is well prepared for in terms of capacity building training for newly elected lawmakers. “Such high turnovers have never been a challenge to NILDS at any time since it is a body fundamentally saddled with the responsibility of training key players in the legislative arm of government “, he said. He, however, posited that the periodic high turnovers will gradually fizzle out in subsequent elections after the 2023 one as the practice of democracy gets more rooted in the country, especially with provisions of the 2022 electoral Act. On the capacity building for non-academic staff of the Institute, Professor Sulaiman said, as trainers, they need to be well trained as well, since nobody can give what he or she doesn’t have. The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, in his remarks at the workshop, commended NILDS for living up to its mandate as far as the training of lawmakers, their aides, staff of the National Assembly and the Institute are concerned.
