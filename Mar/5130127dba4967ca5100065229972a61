A lady, Mercy Oba, has been remanded into the Correctional Centre in Sapele by the Magistrate Court sitting in Isiokolo, Ethiope-East Local Government Area of Delta State. The lady was dragged to the court on charges bordering on indecent assault, wounding and malicious damages by the police and a human right activist, Comrade Kelvin Ejumudo. The Court adjourned the case to March 30, 2022. The human right activist, Comrade Kelvin Ejumudo disclosed this on his timeline on Facebook. He said the woman wept profusely as she was driven off in his private car after being remanded by the court. Comrade Ejumudo said the position of the court would serve as a deterrent to others who go about causing trouble and inflicting pain on people. Comrade Ejumudo thanked the Divisional Police Officer, DPO of Isiokolo Division, SP Tanko Jandwa for ensuring that the matter was not swept under the carpet. “My special appreciation to the DPO Isiokolo Division SP Tanko Jandwa for standing tall and ensuring the case was not compromised and duly charged to Court.” Comrade Ejumudo said he shall continue to pursue justice for all citizens irrespective of their tribe, religion, creed and affiliations.
