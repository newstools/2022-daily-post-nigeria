The Lagos State Government has diverted traffic following the inferno that engulfed the Apongbon axis of the Eko Bridge. The government also announced the shut of the bridge to ensure the well-being of motorists. Commissioner for Transportation, Frederic Oladeinde said an integrity assessment will be carried out. This is to ascertain the level of damage caused by the fire for adequate rehabilitation of the bridge. A statement Wednesday night by Oladeinde listed alternative routes for road users. Those heading towards Apongbon from Surulere and environs can use Ijora/Apapa route or Leventis/UBA Roundabout to connect Marina and other destinations. Motorists were also advised to use Ebute Ero to link Inner Marina and Third Mainland Bridge to continue their journey. The official assured that Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) officers have been deployed to minimize inconveniences. Oladeinde sympathized with owners of shops razed during the inferno, assuring that the authorities are committed to ensuring safety of all residents.
