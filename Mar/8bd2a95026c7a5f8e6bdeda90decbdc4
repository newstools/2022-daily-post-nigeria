President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has hit out at NATO nations, saying they lack the courage to come for his country under Russian invasion. Addressing a press briefing on Saturday, Zelensky said NATO is reluctant to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. The Ukrainian leader said the West need to be more involved in discussions and even provide their own security guarantees to his country. He said NATO member nations “lack the courage to come together for Ukraine” and that there is “no agreed position,” CNN reports. The President further stated that Ukraine is working tirelessly to see that the ongoing war comes to an end, and is ready to start the process. “Our diplomats are working on the details of the agenda of the possible meeting of Ukrainian and Russian delegations,” he said. “I would like this to happen. So we can actually, not just on words, start the process of settlement, peace and the end of the war.” “This is how the end to war starts in a civilized world,” he said. The Ukrainian president said he was hoping diplomacy could bring peace, saying there was “a signal” coming from the Russian side about being ready to negotiate, although he gave no details on what this signal was.
