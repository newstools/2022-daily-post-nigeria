The Rasaq Salinsile faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State has debunked information making the round that the petition of Moshood Adeoti, its aspirant in the just concluded February 19 gubernatorial primary election has been dismissed. The faction has also accused the Osun APC gubernatorial primary election committee of complicity in frustrating the appeal of its aspirant, Adeoti. Speaking through Abiodun Agboola, its Publicity Secretary, the faction which affirmed that it does not intend to accuse the party’s National Secretariat of complicity added that the manner by which it responded to issues concerning Adeoti gave the impression that whatever steps taken on Osun matters were at the behest of the state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola. While stressing that it is always believed that the party’s national body will correct the anomaly, the faction noted that the task seemed impossible due to the fact that Oyetola’s membership of the National Caretaker and Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (NCECPC) is acting as an impediment. According to the statement, the party which held that justice would never be served in such situation, added that it also doubted if the APC headquarters would want to be burdened with a pall of injustice simply because of an individual. Revealing that it had it on good authority that the date of the primary election was shifted backward to accommodate the alleged manipulation that occurred on election Day, it noted that the change in date was officially confirmed by the NCECPC secretariat after two weeks of uncertainty. The faction also disclosed that all attempts to explore internal party resolution mechanism have not succeeded because they were all resolved fraudulently and compromisingly in favour of the governor who is the vice chairman of the NCECPC of the party. While stating that the move did not come as a surprise to it since Oyetola is a member of the NCECPC AND the All Progressives Congress, the Rasaq Salinsile faction states that it also constituted another regular occurrence of manipulation, abuse of office and suppression of truth. The faction also reiterated its call for Oyetola to be divested of his membership of the party NCECPC alleging that it has made him a referee and player in his own contest.
