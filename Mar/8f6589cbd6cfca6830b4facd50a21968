The national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) finally took place on March 26, in Abuja. The event was held at the Eagle Square after multiple postponements, including warnings by President Muhammadu Buhari. Though several aspirants vied for different positions, the ruling party eventually settled for the consensus option. DAILY POST gathered that the leaders agreed to concede the national chairmanship slot to the President, who picked ex-Nasarawa Governor, Abdullahi Adamu.
