A Magistrate’s court sitting in Ilorin, on Wednesday, remanded four herdsmen who allegedly killed a 50-year-old farmer, Samson Alade, in Lanwa village, a suburb area of Kwara State. The lifeless body of the victim was allegedly found in his farm in the pool of his blood with machete cuts on his head, neck and hands after he was declared missing. The victim’s son, Sunday Alabi, reported the case at the Divisional Police Headquarters, Bode Saadu, Moro Local Government Area of Kwara State. He alleged that his father was killed by four Fulani herdsmen, namely, Idris Yusuf, Issa Gambo, Hassan Sheu and Adamu Saleh. The Prosecutor, Inspector Sekunda Olayide, prayed the court to remand the suspects to enable the police complete their investigation into the case. Trial Magistrate Foluke Olokoyo, however, said her court lacks jurisdiction to try culpable homicide, but adjourned the matter till March 28, 2022.
