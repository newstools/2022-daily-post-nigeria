Residents of Okeho town in Kajola Local Government Area of Oyo State have sealed off the office of Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC) located in the town. DAILY POST gathered that the angry residents sealed the office over alleged erratic supply of electricity in the town by the electricity distribution company. DAILY POST learnt from residents that the decision to seal off the office was taken in the early hours of Tuesday. The youths in the community and other stakeholders amidst tight security went ahead to seal the company on Tuesday.  They alleged that the community had been in total blackout for the past 11 days. The angry residents explained that this made them seal off the office of the electricity distribution company on Tuesday. The residents explained further that the sealing of the branch office would remain until further notice. But, the head media of relations of IBEDC, Busola Tunwase, while speaking with DAILY POST, said the problem has to do with low supply of electricity. She said that the company had met the residents to appeal to them. Tunwase, who spoke with DAILY POST Tuesday evening said, “I am aware. It has to do with supply and it is not an IBEDC fault. “We just explained to them. We have appealed to them. What we don’t have, we can’t give it. It is not just Okeho. The supply is just poor. “We have begged them, we have apologised. We have had a meeting with them. We just have to explain further.”
