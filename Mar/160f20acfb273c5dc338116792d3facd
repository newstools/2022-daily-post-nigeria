A strong Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Caucus in Kano State, under the leadership of Ambassador Aminu Wali and Alhaji Sule Lamido for Jigawa State Governor, has called on the National Working Committee of the party to quickly sanction Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, for alleged anti-party activities. Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, was recently reported to have been hobnobbing with the New Nigeria People’s Party NNPP, a development that had created suspicions that he was planning to dump the PDP. However, rising from a meeting that had Ambassador Aminu Wali, Alhaji Sule Lamido, Senator Bello Hayathou, and many other strong party members in attendance at the Lamido Sharada office, Tuesday, they accused Kwankwaso of anti-party and asked NWC of the PDP to dissolve the Kano exco. Reading a communique of the meeting, a former Kwankwaso loyalist and who was his former commissioner, Yusuf Bello Dambatta, said the desperate attempt by Senator Kwankwaso to control the party while promoting NNPP ideals should be checked. “This desperation is nothing but aimed at sabotaging the PDP in 2023 elections and beyond and as well deny it the chances of fielding any candidate so that his new party will use the chance and win all positions. By maintaining the leadership of PDP in the firm grip of Kwankwaso despite his anti-party, has left millions of party followers in limbo, since selling of expiration forms closes by 1st April 2022, which means PDP will end up without any candidate.” Dambatta noted further that all of them that attended the meeting have resolved to work in unity, harmony, cohesion, solidarity and inclusiveness to ensure that everybody is carried along.
