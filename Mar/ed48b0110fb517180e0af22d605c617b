Former Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, has said Chelsea’s new owners cannot match Roman Abramovich’s spending power. Abramovich is believed to be close to selling the Premier League club, following his country’s decision to invade Ukraine last week. The Russian billionaire bought the Blues in 2003 and transformed them into perennial winners. When asked if Chelsea’s new owners will be able to match Abramovich’s spending power, Wenger said on beIN Sports: “You cannot. Today you cannot put that money in, privately, that is impossible. It is limited to, I think, £200m over three years. At that time you could put a billion in. “I always advised people who wanted to buy football clubs, instead of putting £100m in every year, put £500m in the first year and buy the right players, then you have a team. He could do that and he did very well and today I think the club is managed very well and is at a top-level.”
