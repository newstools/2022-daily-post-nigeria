Some Nigerian celebrities have reacted to the news of the abducted BRT passenger, Oluwabamise Ayanwola, who was found dead with her private parts missing. Recall that Bamise, who got missing after she boarded a BRT bus at Chevron bus stop, was found dead on Carter Bridge, Lagos State. Well-meaning Nigerians have widely condemned the circumstances leading to Bamise’s death. Korede Bello reacting to the sad incident, said the security and justice system in Nigeria needs to be better as evildoers are getting smarter. His tweet read, “I’ll never understand how people can look so normal and yet be so evil! Are we ever really safe? I pray Bamise’s family gets justice for their daughter. “This is overwhelmingly heartbreaking,” Korede Bello tweeted. “Evildoers are getting smarter and our security and justice system need to be better than what it is right now if not God help us all.” Also, Mr Marcaroni, a popular comedian, on his Twitter page, “Bamise’s story is so heartbreaking. It’s even more worrisome that we don’t know how many people have suffered the same fate as her. “For all we know, there could be more to suffer the same fate, and that is because it is hard to get justice in our society. According to him, “When there are little or no consequences for evil doing, evildoers are emboldened, and we end up building a society where evil is waiting to befall everyone.” Music producer, Samklef, tweeting asked the government to expose those responsibly. “So they killed that girl (Bamise) inside BRT bus? Government bus? I believe this is what those people have been doing, but God just wanted to expose them. “Please always tell your family the number of any BRT bus you are entering. This is sad.”
