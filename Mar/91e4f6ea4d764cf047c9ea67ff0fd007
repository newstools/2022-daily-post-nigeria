The House of Representatives has summoned the security Chiefs to an emergency meeting over the recent attacks on the Kaduna-Abuja rail line and Kaduna International Airport. The House issued the invitation after an extensive debate on the rate of insecurity in Nigeria at the plenary on Tuesday. Presiding over the session, the Deputy Speaker of the House, Ahmed Wase, said the meeting was aimed at discussing the security situation in Nigeria. Those to appear before the House include the National Security Adviser, Maj.-Gen. Babagana Monguno (retd.); Minister of Defence, Maj.-Gen. Bashir Magashi (retd.); Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Isiaka Amao; Director-General, Department of State Services, Yusuf Bichi; Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba; Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi; Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika; Director-General, NCAA, Musa Nuhu; Managing Director, FAAN, Rabiu Yadudu; Managing Director, NAMA, Mathew Pwajok; and General Manager, Nigerian Railway Corporation, Fidet Okhiria. Wase said: “We beg that the invitation be sent as soon as possible. Hopefully, we will start the meeting from tomorrow (Wednesday).” The resolution was based on a motion of urgent public importance moved by the Chairman of the House Committee on Aviation, Nnolim Nnaji, titled, ‘Urgent Need for the Federal Government to Investigate the Recent Attack at Kaduna International Airport and Reinforce Security Surveillance and Personnel in All the Nigerian Airports.’ Gunmen believed to be bandits had bombed a rail line between Katari and Rijani train stations, along the Kaduna-Abuja route.
