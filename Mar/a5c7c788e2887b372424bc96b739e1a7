Former Crystal Palace owner, Simon Jordan, has blamed former England U21 Coach, Stuart Pearce, for the former Chelsea star Victor Moses’ switch of allegiance to the Super Eagles of Nigeria. Moses, who was born in Nigeria, won the top scorer award at the 2007 U17 EURO with three goals and scored the same number of goals at the 2007 FIFA U17 World Cup won by Nigeria. The winger also earned caps for the Young Lions at Under 16, Under 19 and Under 21 levels before committing his international future to Nigeria back in 2011. Moses played a key role for the Super Eagles in their 2013 Africa Cup of Nations triumph and went on to represent the West African giants in the 2014 and 2018 World Cups. But Jordan believes Pearce did not do enough to keep Moses. “Victor Moses chose to leave the England setup after being quite pivotal in some of the achievements of the lower level age groups,” Jordan said on talkSPORT. “And when it came to the full setup, I was very cross with Stuart Pearce at the time because I felt he didn’t do enough to keep somebody in the fold and rather than develop these players to have them playing for their countries, they got ostracized to a point they feel the necessity to play for another country. “Now, of course, you can say that might have been the end product of a series of scenarios that were going to end up that way, but there’s no doubt I’m not sure Danny’s right about the abundance of talent we had at wide left in England. “Sterling wasn’t there in 2013, there was not an embarrassment of riches on that side. Victor Moses was playing there, he was overlooked by England.”
