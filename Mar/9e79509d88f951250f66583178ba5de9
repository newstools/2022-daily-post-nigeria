An indigene of Aladja Community in Udu Local Government Area of Delta State, Ighotegwolor Bezi has said the zoning arrangement in the People’s Democratic Party, PDP in Delta State should be respected. Bezi in an interview with our Correspondent in Warri stressed that it is the turn of Delta Central Senatorial District to produce the next governor in 2023. He said, “On zoning, the gentleman agreement should be respected and that means it is the turn of the Delta central.” Bezi, a Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC in Aladja Community advised Deltans to be wary of smooth-talking politicians who are out to deceive and not to better their lots. Bezi who described Delta State Governor, Arthur Ifeanyi Okowa as a very good man to an extent and a bad one to another degree, said he did something specular for Aladja Grammar School, Aladja. According to him, “The buildings in the school were so dilapidated that students and teachers were at risk of being submerged under the ceilings that had caved in and ready to fall down. “During the Uduaghan Government, I personally wrote to the government but to no avail. “When Okowa came in Jite Brown asked me to write again. I was reluctant but he pressed on and I wrote. Jite Brown also wrote and took me to meet Okowa who promised us to renovate the dilapidated buildings. “On the day the mother of Hon. Jite Brown was buried Okowa made the promise, public. And true to his words, after a month the contractor mobilised to site and the whole school wore a new look. “This alone made me see him as a good person. Not done yet he built the Ekiagbon/Ekrorhion road in Aladja and even the Aladja/Isaba road. “That road alone helped in great measure to bolster the peace process between Aladja and Isaba. These, to me, are good measures worthy of praise.” He, however, said the Governor has not really done much for the state compared to the allocation from the Federal Government.
