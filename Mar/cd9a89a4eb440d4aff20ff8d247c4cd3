An Abuja Federal High Court has ordered the transfer of former police Intelligence Response Team, IRT, boss, Abba Kyari to Kuje prison. Justice Emeka Nwike also ordered the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, to transfer the six others facing drug trafficking charges alongside Kyari to the Kuje Correctional Center. The judge gave the order after denying the former Deputy Commissioner of Police alongside the other defendants bail. Justice Nwite had held that the NDLEA placed sufficient materials before it to warrant denying Kyari and the other defendants bail. The court equally denied bail to former members of the IRT, ACP Sunday Ubia, Inspector Simon Agirgba, and Inspector John Nuhu. Other defendants in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/57/2022, are; ASP Bawa James, as well as two drug traffickers that were arrested at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport in Enugu, Chibunna Patrick Umeibe and Emeka Alphonsus Ezenwane. Meanwhile, Justice Nwite ordered an accelerated trial of the defendants, fixed for April 28 for the review of facts in respect of the case against Umeibe and Ezenwane.
