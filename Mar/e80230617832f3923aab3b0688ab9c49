The list of demands put forward by the union included the implementation of a full salary table for tertiary institutions, 65 years retirement age, promotion exercises for the 2019, 2020 and 2021 fiscal year. They also demanded the payment of 29 months half salary arrears and contributory pension scheme monthly deduction of May and June 2019, March, April and May 2020. DAILY POST gathered that the two-week warning strike had started from Monday, March 14, 2022, after which seriousness on the part of the State government would be re-evaluated. The union revealed that it had previously notified the Osun State Government of a 7-day and 21-day strike ultimatum, respectively. It added that the strike notice had also been tarried for two weeks without any concrete effort on the part of the government to resolve the issues raised.
