The former treasurer of the National Union of Road Transport Workers, NURTW, in Ekiti State, Omoleye Olajide Johnson, was on Wednesday attacked and brutalized by some commercial drivers loyal to the state chairman of the union, Osho Farotimi. Johnson had branded his vehicle in support of the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate, Hon. Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji, against the wish of the chairman known as Oshopolo. Farotimi had openly campaigned for the APC candidate while members under his union were mandated to place banners of BAO on their vehicles. According to findings, Farotimi and his former treasurer had been at loggerhead since their inauguration before the treasurer was forced out of the system. The NURTW chairman reportedly views the support of his former EXCO member for BAO as a threat to his ambition of securing a second term in office, hence the need to stop him. Narrating his ordeal, Johnson said, “I was passing through Tosin Aluko motor park with BAO branded vehicle on Wednesday, suddenly some drivers stopped me and removed all the branded paper. “They started attacking me and inflicted serious wounds on me including both eyes, they asked me to go and join Segun Oni’s SDP that I don’t have a chance in BAO government. “Among those that attacked me are Dotun Olufimo, Odunayo Afolabi, Ojo Omotosho Oluwaseun, Femi Ogunlusi, Apoewa and Sunday Boboye.” He pleaded with the government and security agents to intervene and bring all culprits to book. When contacted, Farotimi denied the allegation. ”Since my inauguration, both of us have not been relating, I don’t know where and how he got himself into such mess, I am innocent,” he said. When contacted, the Ekiti State Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Sunday Abutu, said the police have not received the report of the attack, urging the victim to report at the nearest police station after which necessary actions would be taken.
