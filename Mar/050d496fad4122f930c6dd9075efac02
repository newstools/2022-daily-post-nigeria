The South-South Vice-Chairman of the Labour Party, Prince Felix Reuben, has predicted the disintegration of the All Progressives Congress, APC, after its National Convention slated for Saturday. Reuben wondered how APC would go into the convention without resolving all the issues it had at the state chapters where there are factions. He said the party lacks ideology having been established because it just “wanted to seize power”. According to him “I see a lot of disintegration within their ranks because it is a party that was formed just because they wanted to seize power and that’s why they allow all kinds of people into the party. “That’s why they have all these issues. Today, in every state of Nigeria, APC has two or three factions and they are going to the convention without resolving those issues. “So, I’m seeing APC as a house divided against itself which the Bible said it cannot stand. “I wish them good luck but I’m sure after the convention there will be nothing called the APC.”
