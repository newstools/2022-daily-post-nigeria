Mike Dean will retire as a Premier League referee at the end of this season, bringing an end to his 22-year-old career in England’s topflight. The 53-year-old is easily one of the most recognisable officials currently working in the Premier League. Dean has taken charge of 553 fixtures since his introduction to the top division in 2000. He has officiated more games than any of his counterparts and has also dished out more red cards – a tally of 114. But according to the UK Telegraph, the 2021/22 season will be his final, with Dean ready to call time on his on-field career. It is suggested that Dean is currently in talks with the Professional Game Match Officials (PGMOL), to potentially continue as one of just two full-time VAR officials, meaning his sole responsibility would be working from Stockley Park.
