Former Kano State Governor, Rabiu Kwankwaso, has expressed displeasure with the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Kwankwaso said some PDP members feel he is not needed. He noted that the PDP would crumble if he defected to another political party. He spoke on Channels Television’s Political Paradigm where he responded to what would be PDP’s fate if he defects. Kwankwaso accused the PDP of belittling him in its operations in Kano State. He wondered why the party refused him from nominating candidates for some key positions. According to Kwankwaso: “There is no question about it. Where are the leaders? Who are the leaders? They will crumble. “I should be one of the most important individuals in a party like PDP. “Look at the scenario in the North West during the congress, from the things that were taken to Kano, the vice-chairman of the zone was supposed to be given to me to nominate somebody. Just like it was done in Katsina, (Former Governor Ibrahim) Shema nominated what was allocated to him, in Kaduna (Former Governor Ahmed) Makarfi did that, in Jigawa (Former Governor) Sule Lamido did that, in Kebbi Kabiru Turaki did that, in Sokoto (Governor Aminu) Tambuwal did that. “It is only in Kano that they thought I was too small to be given that position and that’s what triggered the whole thing, and everybody kept quiet and were so happy that maybe Kwankwaso is not needed in the party.” Recently, Kwankwaso is rumoured to have defected to the newly formed New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP. Amid the rumoured defection, NNPP had dismissed the possibility of an automatic ticket for Kwankwaso if he joined the party.
