A Joint security team of the Kwara state police command, local hunters and vigilante have neutralized three kidnappers terrorising the people of Obbo-Ile, Osi and Eruku communities in the Kwara South Senatorial District. They were neutralized while the joint security team was on the trail of kidnappers following the recent killing of some victims including the APC women leader, Mrs Olomo Sunday Abolaji at the Obbo-Ile, Eruku/Isapa axis of the Kwara South Senatorial District while on her way home after attending a political event in Ilorin. The spokesman of the state police command, SP Okasanmi Ajayi in Ilorin on Tuesday, disclosed that “while on the trail of the kidnappers abducting and in few cases killing their victims around Kwara South senatorial zone of the State, especially the recent kidnap and killing of a political party women leader and others in Obbo, Eruku and Isapa axis, Tactical teams of Kwara State Police Command working with the Vigilante and local Hunters, engaged the kidnappers in Ejiu, Obbo Ile and Osi forest at about 2100hrs of 28/3/2022 and 29/3/2022. “During exchange of fire between the kidnappers and the joint teams of vigilante and police, three of the kidnappers were neutralized, while others escaped with gunshot injuries.” According to the spokesman, exhibits recovered from them included, One cut to size locally made pistol, One locally made gun, Four cutlasses and a bunch of criminal charms. Okasanmi revealed that one of the neutralized kidnappers was identified as Dogo who had been on the wanted list of the police for the killings of one Femi Afolayan for failure to pay ransom sometime in February 2022. Efforts are ongoing to track and arrest the fleeing kidnappers to free the axis that has lately been termed a danger zone by the citizens of the area. The commissioner of police Kwara State, Tuesday Assayomo, warned criminals to pack their bags and leave Kwara State, as the command is double charged to ensure that citizens and residents of Kwara State sleep with their two eyes closed at night. He further enjoined the people of Kwara State to continue to work with the security agencies by exposing the criminal elements in their localities.
