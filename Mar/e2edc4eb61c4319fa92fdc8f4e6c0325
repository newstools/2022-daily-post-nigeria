Ahead of the 2023 Presidential election, Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State on Wednesday dismissed the issue of zoning within the All Progressives Congress, APC. Bello maintained that the much talked about zoning formula does not exist in the constitution of the APC and Nigeria. He spoke on Arise TV while reacting to the APC producing its National Chairman and a Presidential candidate from the same region of Northcentral. The governor noted that the problems confronting Nigeria have nothing to do with zoning, hence emphasis should be placed on credible Presidential candidates. According to Bello: “APC has no zoning formula as far as the party’s law is concerned, no zoning formula as far as the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is concerned. Poverty, insecurity, lack of infrastructure has no zoning. “These are the problems we are confronted with today, and they have no zoning. The party delegates would vote for me. “I would [prefer that we go by merit and vote for who can get these problems solved.”
