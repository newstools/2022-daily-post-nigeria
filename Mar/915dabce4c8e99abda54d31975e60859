The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has finally released the embalmed former governor of Anambra State, Willie Obiano. The immediate past governor, who was nabbed by the anti-graft agency a few hours after handing over to the current governor, Charles Soludo last week, was given an administrative bail on Wednesday evening. According to Daily Trust, Obiano’s passport was seized by the EFCC as part of his bail condition. Efforts by DAILY POST to reach the Commission for comment on the development, proved abortive as at press time, as the EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren could not respond to text message forwarded to him. Recall that Obiano was nabbed on Thursday at the Lagos Airport while on his way to the United States of America. The EFCC spokesman had told our correspondent that Obiano was on their watch list prior to his arrest. The former governor was subsequently transferred to the headquarters of the commission, where he was quizzed for days over alleged mismanagement of N5 billion Sure-P money, N37 billion security vote, withdrawn in cash, as well as some inflated contracts.
