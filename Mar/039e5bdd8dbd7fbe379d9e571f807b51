Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, will be without David de Gea for the visit of Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League this evening. The Spanish goalkeeper has been in fine form for the Red Devils, even as they continue to have an indifferent season. However, according to the Manchester Evening News, he will be unavailable to face Spurs due to illness. Second-choice goalie, Dean Henderson, is expected to deputise. Henderson hasn’t featured in the Premier League since last May. The 25-year-old will be handed a rare opportunity this evening, as United look to bounce back from their humiliating 4-1 defeat at Manchester City last weekend.
