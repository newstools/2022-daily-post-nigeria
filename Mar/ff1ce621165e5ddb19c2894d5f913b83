President Muhammadu Buhari, has condemned in strong terms the destruction in Imo State, of buildings and assets of the Police and the home of Professor George Obiozor, the President General of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo. Buhari, who spoke through his media aide, Garba Shehu on Sunday, described Obiozor as a leading voice of moderation in the affairs of the country who does not deserve such treatment. Beyond the condemnation of violence in the subregion, Buhari urged everyone to maintain peace, insisting that the law and order situation in the entire Southeast is being reviewed. He said while this is being done, the people of Imo State in particular and the subregion in general, should maintain peace as the police and other agencies are working to ensure that normalcy is restored at the earliest. He equally extended sympathies to the police authorities over the losses of men and materials, and to Professor Obiozor who he urged to maintain his commitment to the peace and oneness of the Federation against these odds. Recall that Imo state was at the weekend thrown into another wave of violence when some unknown gunmen unleashed attacks on the property of Chief Obiozor in Imo State. While it has been widely condemned by cross sections of Nigerians, it is not clear whether members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) were responsible for the act.
