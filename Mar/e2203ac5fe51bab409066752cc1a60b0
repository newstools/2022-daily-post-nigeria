Senator Suleiman Hunkuyi has officially dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Senator Hunkuyi was in the last Senate on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), but shortly before the 2019 general elections, he dumped the party for the PDP. In a letter to his ward chairman in Kudan Local Government Area of Kaduna State, dated 25th February, 2022, he explained that he had withdrawn his membership of the party, PDP. The letter to the Kudan chairman of PDP by Senator Hunkuyi did not signify his next line of action or which political party he is likely to join. The State PDP Secretary, Ibrahim Wosono also confirmed that the party had received Senator Hunkuyi’s letter. According to Ibrahim Wosono, “We confirmed from his ward that they have received his letter. “So, we wish him well, because it is not the first time he is leaving our party. His exit this time will not affect the party in any way.”
