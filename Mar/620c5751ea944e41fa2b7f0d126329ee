President Muhammadu Buhari has said that his absence from the country would not affect the running of government as the Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, who would be assisted by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, as well as his Chief of Staff, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, would be in charge. Buhari stated this when he fielded questions from State House correspondents shortly before departing the Presidential Wing of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, for London on Sunday, NAN reports. The president had initially planned to embark on the London trip from Nairobi, Kenya, after attending the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) at 50 in that country on Friday. On the London trip, Buhari said, ”Well, I cannot claim to be doing the work alone. “The government is fully represented – the Vice-President is there, constitutionally when I’m away, he’s in charge, and the Secretary to the government and then the chief of staff. So, no problem.” Recall that Buhari’s spokesman, Femi Adesina, had on March 1, in a statement, said that from Kenya, the President would proceed to London for ”routine medical checks that will last for a maximum of two weeks.” However, Buhari returned to Abuja on Friday at about 1 pm before embarking on the London trip on Sunday.
