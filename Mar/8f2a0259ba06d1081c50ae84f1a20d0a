The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has rejected a letter inviting it to an emergency meeting of the National Executive Committee(NEC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC). INEC’s response, dated March 9, signed by its Secretary, Rose Anthony, was titled, “Re: Invitation to the emergency meeting of the National Executive Committee”, and addressed to the National Chairman, APC Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC). The Commission drew the attention of the APC CECPC to the fact that the letter of invitation was not signed by Gov. Mai Mala Buni, National Chairman APC CECPC and its Secretary, Sen. John Akpanudoedehe. This, it said, was contrary to the provision of Article 1.1.3 of the INEC’s Regulations and Guidelines for Political Party Operations (2018). The Commission also reminded those who wrote and signed the letter of the provision in Section 82(1) of the Electoral Act 2022. It said the section required ‘at least 21 days’ notice of any convention, congress, conference, or meeting convened for the purpose of merger and electing members of its executive committees, other governing bodies or nominating candidates for any elective office. INEC urged the APC to note the key issues raised for compliance, NAN reports. INEC’s letter read in part: “Please refer to your letter Ref.APC/NHDQ/INEC/019/022/32, dated 8th March 2022. “The Commission draws your attention to the fact that the notice for the meeting was not signed by the national chairman and national secretary of the CECPC. “This is contrary to the provision of the Article 1.1.3 of the commission’s Regulations and Guidelines for Political Party Operations (2018).”
