Former Juventus manager, Maurizio Sarri has claimed that Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo did not want to play as a striker. Sarri coached Ronaldo during their time together at Juventus. Ronaldo left Juventus to rejoin Man United for £12.7 million last September. The 37-year-old has endured a disappointing campaign for the Premier League giants as their lead striker with just one goal in his last ten games for the club. Sarri, who is now the current manager of Lazio, has brought to light the issue Ronaldo had with being the main striker at Juventus, having spent the majority of his time as a free-roaming winger at Real Madrid. “Cristiano scored more Serie A goals in his season with me than any other,” Sarri told Sky Italia. “He was prepared to play centre-forward in a few games when we had an emergency situation, but he didn’t much like the idea of doing it regularly. “In those situations, you end up challenging the certainties that the player has. Ronaldo scored 35-40 goals per season by starting from that wider position, so for him, it was an almost absurd request. That’s understandable for the way he plays,” he added.
