Nigerian lawmakers in the House of Representatives has rejected a bill that sought to prohibit public servants from attending foreign schools. The bill sponsored by Sergius Ogun was rejected by members of the House on Thursday on the floor of the green chamber. It would be recalled that the same bill was sponsored by Mr Ogun in 2018 but the lawmakers rejected it. Leading the debate, Mr Ogun argued that the bill will help to address the fallen standard in Nigerian public schools. “This bill is proposed against the background of fallen standards in our educational system and the need to bring the sector up to speed with global best standards. “Unfortunately, as a result of the inability of the government to provide quality education in its public educational institutions, Nigerians have resorted to private schools and foreign schools for their education,” he said. Mr Ogun’s argument did not sway his colleagues, as they argued against his points. Nicholas Ossai from Delta State said the bill violates the individual rights of Nigerians. He argued that the bill should be withdrawn. When the bill was put into question, it was rejected.
