A moment of silence was observed at the 94th Oscars award in honour of those fighting for Ukraine and their lives. During the 30 seconds of quiet, the Oscars asked celebrities to help in providing food, medical care to Ukrainian families in need. The message on the screen read, “We would like to have a moment of silence to show our support for the people of Ukraine currently facing invasion, conflict and prejudice within their own borders. “While the film is an important avenue for us to express our humanity in times of conflict, the reality is millions of families in Ukraine need food, medical care, clean water and emergency services. “Resources are scarce, and we collectively as a global community, can do much more. “We ask you to support Ukraine in any way you are able #StandwithUkraine.” The war in Ukraine has been ongoing for more than a month as Russia continues its attack on its neighbour. About 1,000 civilians, including children, have died since President Vladimir Putin began a “special military operation” bombing major cities including Kharkiv, Mariupol and Kyiv in Ukraine. A quarter of Ukraine’s 44 million people have fled to neighbouring nations such as Poland and Romania for safety.
