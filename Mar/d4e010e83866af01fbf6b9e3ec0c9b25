The FA have confirmed that they are working with the UK Government to find a suitable way to sell Wembley tickets to Chelsea fans ahead of the Blues’ FA Cup semi-final tie with Crystal Palace next month. Chelsea are currently operating under a special license following the UK Government sanctions on Roman Abramovich. The sanctions on Abramovich mean that Chelsea cannot sell merchandise or new tickets, with only season ticket holders currently able to attend fixtures due to the sanctions imposed on Abramovich. However, in a statement, the FA said: “We hope to have sell-out crowds at both of our Emirates FA Cup Semi-Finals at Wembley Stadium. “This includes tickets for Chelsea supporters for their match against Crystal Palace, and we are working with the Government on a method to achieve this while respecting the sanctions that are currently in place on Chelsea.” Meanwhile, the Times have reported that one way that Chelsea could sell tickets is via a commercial ticketing agency, with funds raised being put into a frozen account. Member of Parliament of the United Kingdom, Julian Knight, had urged the UK government to allow Chelsea fans access to FA Cup semi-final tickets.
