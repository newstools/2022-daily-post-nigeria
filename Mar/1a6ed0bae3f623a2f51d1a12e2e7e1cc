Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti, has said there is “no euphoria” at the club after their dramatic Champions League comeback against Paris Saint-Germain this week. Karim Benzema scored a 17-minute hat-trick at the Bernabeu to give Los Blancos a 3-1 win in their last-16 fixture. Kylian Mbappe had put the Ligue 1 giants 2-0 up on aggregate before halftime. “There’s no euphoria at the club or in the team. “We won the game and we’re still in the Champions League, but tomorrow is another game in another competition. “This team is used to looking forward, even when it’s won trophies. We’re only in the Champions League quarterfinals,” Ancelotti said on Sunday in a news conference ahead of Madrid’s LaLiga game at Real Mallorca.
