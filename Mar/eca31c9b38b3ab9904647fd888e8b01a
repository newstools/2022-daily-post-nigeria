Two female Katsina teenagers, Mubaraka Naziru and Amina Rabiu, on Saturday, said they disappeared from the forest when the bandits guarding them drank to stupor and fell deeply asleep. DAILY POST recalls that the two teenagers were abducted when bandits invaded Batsari in Katsina State on Wednesday around 12 am. The two teenagers, who said the bandits promised them that they will be married off as soon as they were taken to their kingpin, said they were served with bottled juice and loaves of bread while the bandits consumed alcohol. Naziru, while speaking to journalists in Katsina, said as the bandits went into a deep sleep, and were snoring, they quietly moved from the scene and gradually walked through the bush. Though they didn’t know the direction they were going, they walked throughout the night in a bush. “Upon realizing that they were unconscious, we decided to run away. We walked kilometres to a hill and we were lost in the bush,” the teenagers said. According to them, they met some herders at the foot of a hill and they were directed to the nearby village, Muniya, in Safana Local Government Area, Katsina State. It was at Muniya that they were offered help and taken back home.
