The acting Comptroller General of Immigration (CGI) Idris Jere has ordered the removal of two operatives from the Murtala Muhammed International Airport Command (MMIA) in Lagos. The personnel were sanctioned for unprofessional conduct, Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) spokesman Amos Akpu said in a statement on Friday. A Twitter user had narrated how a 14-year-old daughter who was travelling out of the country was extorted. Akpu said the NIS, via its Twitter handle, contacted the woman and assured that the matter would be looked into. The CGI then directed an investigation, including a thorough check of the CCTV covering the section. The probe team headed by the Lagos Airport Comptroller of Immigration, CIS Kemi Nandap caught the officers. Akpu noted that they were found culpable of unprofessional action in the handling of the clearance process of the passenger. “They have been withdrawn from the airport and all privileges as operatives at the airport stripped off them. “They are currently undergoing necessary disciplinary procedures in line with the directives of the acting Comptroller General.” Jere stressed his administration’s zero tolerance for all forms of indecent conducts and urged members of the public to report such acts to the NIS.
