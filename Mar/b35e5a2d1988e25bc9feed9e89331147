Ex-Senate President Bukola Saraki, Sokoto Governor Aminu Tambuwal and Bauchi Governor Bala Mohammed have denied withdrawing from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 2023 presidential race. There are rumours that the trio had stepped down for former Vice President Atiku Abubakar. The speculations heightened after they met with the Wazirin Adamawa on Monday in Abuja. A statement on Wednesday, by Director-General, Saraki Campaign Council, Earl Osaro Onaiwu, dismissed the report as “sheer mischief”. Onaiwu noted that it was planted by “those who want to gain the PDP presidential ticket by deceit.” He said Saraki and the governors only met Atiku with the sole objective to inform him of their push towards a consensus candidate. The DG insists there was no talk of anyone stepping down “as it is yet premature”. “Our candidate is eminently qualified for the PDP presidential as a former two-term governor, Chairman of the Governors Forum, Senate President and a former presidential aspirant. “Governor Aminu Tambuwal as former Speaker of the House of Representatives and a serving two-term governor is also qualified to be considered for the ticket. “Governor Bala Mohammed, a former senator, ex-minister and a serving governor is qualified for the ticket.” Onaiwu said, ” no other aspirant should hide under the “nebulous assumption” that he is overly qualified than others to be stepped down for. The statement added that if there is a concrete agreement on a winning consensus and others step down for whoever, “it will be done openly”. “Until then, Senator Bukola Saraki, Tambuwal and Mohammed are still in the race”, Onaiwu added.
