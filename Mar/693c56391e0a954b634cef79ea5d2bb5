The woman was arrested Sunday by the police for “pouring petrol on her daughter and setting her ablaze.” DAILY POST learnt that Tijani’s arrest followed a report lodged at Mowe police division by one Moroof Ayinde. The said Ayinde had told the police that the suspect, who lives in the same house with him, poured petrol on her little daughter and set her ablaze. The man had also informed the police that the mother was angry because the victim gave a phone she seized from one of her children back to the owner. The Ogun State police image maker, Abimbola Oyeyemi, told newsmen on Tuesday that upon the report, the DPO Mowe division, CSP Folashade Tanaruno, moved to the scene with detectives and arrested the suspect.

The woman is to be investigated at the State CIID as ordered by the Ogun Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole.
