President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday dismissed the assertion that the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) lacks the capacity to conduct its national convention on March 26, saying the party will surprise its critics. Buhari stated this when he fielded questions from State House correspondents shortly before departing the Presidential Wing of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, for London today. Recall that Buhari had initially planned to embark on the London trip from Nairobi, Kenya, after attending the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) at 50 in that country on Friday. Buhari said:” Well, they (critics) should wait and see. How did we come as a party to take power from the ruling party who had been there before us for so many years? “So we’ve the capacity, everything will be alright.” Meanwhile, the division in the APC deepened a few days ago, after some key party members discovered, via leaked documents, how President Buhari single-handedly dictated the composition of the next Executive Committee of the party. APC has been bogged with its chieftains jostling for who controls the incoming leadership of the party and, by implication, who has the upper hand in deciding the party’s next presidential flagbearer. President Buhari has tactically avoided formally naming or endorsing his successor, but handpicking the APC Executive Committee will enable him single-handedly to decide who runs to succeed him on the party’s ticket.
