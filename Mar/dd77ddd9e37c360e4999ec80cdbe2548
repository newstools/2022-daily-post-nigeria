Gary Neville has slammed Manchester United as embarrassing after his former club were beaten 4-1 by city rivals, Manchester City in the Premier League on Sunday. Nevile also noted that the Red Devils “threw the towel in” during the game. Kevin de Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez scored two each of the halves to give City’s six-point lead at the top of the Premier League. Jadon Sancho scored Manchester United’s only goal in the encounter. “Manchester United’s response to going 3-1 down has been embarrassing. Ninety-two per cent possession for City? They have given up,” Sky Sports pundit Neville said on co-commentary. “They are walking around the pitch. It’s nowhere near good enough. “As a Manchester United fan, it’s embarrassing. “The effort and intensity from United in the last 20 minutes was non-existent. “The scoreline isn’t the problem. It’s the response to going 3-1 down that’s the problem. They have thrown the towel in.” With the loss, Arsenal have now displaced Manchester United from the fourth position after the Gunners defeated Watford in an earlier game played on Sunday. It also means that Pep Guardiola’s City are now six points above Liverpool in the battle for the 2021-2022 Premier League title with the Reds having a game in hand.
