Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State has sent a supplementary budget of N45Billion to the state House of Assembly. The supplementary budget, which is made up of N41Billion for Recurrent Expenditure and N4Billion for Capital Expenditure, when passed would increase the budget size of the state that was passed last year from N586Billion to N631Billion. The House Leader, Sir Udo Kierian Akpan, while receiving the Executive Bill, tagged, “A Law to make Supplementary Provision for the Service of Akwa Ibom State Government for the year ending on 31st December, 2022,” said the Bill will help in the completion and commissioning of ongoing projects before the expiration of this government. He cited the projects that are in dire need of completion to include the Airport Projects, Dualized Roads in Etinan and Oruk Anam Local Government Areas. He, however, appealed to members to give the Bill the attention it deserves for the budget to be passed as soon as possible. The bill was thereafter referred to the House Committee on Appropriation and Finance to get more contributions relevant MDAs and to report back to the House within 24 hours.
