Some People’s Democratic Party (PDP) leaders were in Benue on Monday as part of consultations ahead of the 2023 elections. They are ex-Senate President Bukola Saraki, Governors of Bauchi and Sokoto States, Bala Mohammed and Aminu Tambuwal. They conferred with Governor Samuel Ortom at the state capital, Makurdi. The three chieftains have obtained the nomination forms to contest in the PDP presidential primary. The meeting followed the one which was held in Abuja last week. The Benue parley deliberated the emergence of a consensus standard-bearer that will face the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) next year. Addressing PDP members, government officials and reporters, Saraki explained their mission in the North-Central state. “This is part of our consultation to show interest in the Presidency. We should come together and find a consensus. “We are at a defining moment in the history of this country. We are committed to finding someone to unite us and reduce rancour. “We have total belief in the unity of our party, we will put the country first. We have confidence in you (Ortom)”, the former Kwara Governor said.
