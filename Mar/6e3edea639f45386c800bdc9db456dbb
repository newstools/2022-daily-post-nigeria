Former Ghana President, John Dramani Mahama, has told the Black Stars of Ghana to be ‘resolute’ when they face the Super Eagles of Nigeria in Abuja. Nigeria will host Ghana in a 2022 FIFA World Cup second leg playoff at the MKO Abiola Stadium on Tuesday evening. Both countries drew 0-0 in the first leg at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi last Friday. However, Mahama remains confident that the Black Stars will claim a spot at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar later this year if they play strong against Nigeria. “Ghana vs Nigeria… the friendship is strong, and the history is rich,” Mahama posted on Facebook as per ModernGhana. “I urge the Black Stars to be resolute today to qualify Ghana for the FIFA 2022 World Cup tournament in Qatar. Go Black Stars Go!”
