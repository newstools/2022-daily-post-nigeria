The National Working Committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has denied releasing the timetable for the 2023 general elections being circulated on social media. PDP said the fake election timetable was the handiwork of mischievous elements who seek to create confusion in its party. The party in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Hon. Debo Ologunagba, on Sunday, confirmed that the fake schedule of activities whatsoever for the 2022/2023 electioneering year did emanate from PDP. It added that no such document was signed and released by the National Organizing Secretary, Hon. Umar M. Bature. “For the avoidance of doubt, the PDP is a Party of Due Process and will release a Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2022/2023 electioneering year after extensive consultation and approval by critical and statutory organs of the party at appropriate levels,” it added. According to the party, the said timetable being circulated on social media is the handiwork of mischievous elements who seeks to create confusion, mislead the public and distract it at this critical point in time. PDP called on all its members and the general public to discountenance the said Timetable and Schedule of Activities, stressing that it did not emanate from the party. The major opposition party hinted that at the appropriate time, the official Timetable and Schedule of Activities of the PDP, when approved will be formally announced and published through the official communication channels and not on social media. The party urged all members and Nigerians, in general, to remain focused and not allow themselves to be distracted in their determined mission to rescue and rebuild the nation from the misrule of the All Progressives Congress (APC).
