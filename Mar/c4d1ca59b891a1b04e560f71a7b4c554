Former Ukraine captain, Andriy Shevchenko, has insisted that President Volodymyr Zelensky’s position was very important amid the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Shevchenko said that Zelensky could have left Ukraine as Russia continues to attack Ukraine, but the President decided to stay to defend his country and people. Recall that the war between Russia and Ukraine began in February and many casualties have since been recorded. Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered the invasion of Ukraine over disagreements on some political issues. “The position of President Volodymyr Zelensky was very important,” Shevchenko told Sportsmail’s Jamie Redknapp. “He could have left. But he sent a clear message to say he would stay and that we had to defend our country. That united the Ukrainian people. He stayed with them, and we won’t give up. “We fight for our choice, for our freedom, for our democracy. When you see the people in the street, going with no arms to stop the tank that is so powerful. We’re going to defend until the end. Russia is not welcome.”
