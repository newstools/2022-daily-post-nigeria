FIFA could expand team squads for the 2022 World Cup from 23 to 26, Reuters reports. On Friday, national team coaches and federation officials will discuss whether to take the step at their meeting with the world football governing body ahead of the draw for the finals. The impact of Covid-19 on players and the use of five substitutes per game has led to suggestions that squads should have three extra players. UEFA allowed 26-man squads for last year’s European Championship, although only 23 players could be named for each match. South American governing body, CONMEBOL, allowed teams in last year’s Copa America to name 28-man squads. Any final decision would need to be made by the organising committee for FIFA competitions and be ratified by the governing body.
