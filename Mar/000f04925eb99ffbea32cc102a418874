Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has publicly tongue-lashed the Edo State Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu. Wike, who was visibly angry with the deputy Governor at the inauguration of the Eastern Bypass road project in Port Harcourt on Saturday, said Shaibu lacked the effrontery to threaten to dump the PDP he came kneeling and begging for ticket when they were kicked out of the All Progressives Congress, APC, prior to the last governorship election in Edo. Wike wondered how a deputy governor who even lost his local government area during the election in 2020 should have the guts to threaten to dump the PDP. “And he lost his local government when we were in Edo, he lost. And he would come out on television to threaten the party that there are alternatives, look at the deputy governor, it’s unfortunate,” Wike said. Recall that Shaibu, who had followed Governor Godwin Obaseki all the way to the PDP when the former National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole frustrated them out of the party, recently complained that they were not welcomed in the PDP. Shaibu, who appeared on a Channels Television programme recently, said himself, Obaseki and their supporters may leave the PDP if the party continues to treat them as outcasts. Meanwhile, Governor Obaseki had vowed to remain in the party, warning those who are not comfortable with his leadership of the PDP in Edo State to find solace elsewhere. Speaking further, the angry Wike said, “It’s very unfortunate for our party, a deputy governor is wearing khaki, look at it, I’ve never seen a thing like this in my life … who is his father?” The coming of Obaseki and his followers into the Edo PDP seems to have rocked the foundation of the party as internal power struggle has continued unabated.
