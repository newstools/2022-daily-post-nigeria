The Coalition of Southern and Middle Belt Youth Leaders Assembly, COSMBYLA, has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to resign with immediate effect for his alleged failure to protect the lives of Nigerians. COSMBYLA, the umbrella body of all the youth groups in the South East, South-South, South West and Middle Belt regions, stated this while reacting to the terrorists’ attacks on the Abuja-Kaduna train. DAILY POST had reported that bandits on Monday night bombed a train conveying passengers from Abuja to Kaduna. Many have been reported dead while others who sustained injuries during the attack are receiving treatment at the hospital. Reacting, in a statement issued by its President General, Goodluck Ibem, COSMBYLA, said if the president fails to resign over his alleged failure to tackle security challenges in the country, there would be mass protests. Describing the incident as coordinated terrorist attacks, the coalition wondered how such attacks were launched without any intelligence by security agencies, saying it is a sign that President Buhari “has surrendered Nigerian sovereignty to terrorists”. “We are at crossroads and only the immediate resignation of President Muhammadu Buhari will bring us out of this present quagmire. Nigerians are sick and tired of excuses, what we need now is positive results We sympathize with the families of those who lost their loved ones to these terrorists who have defeated President Buhari to take over the sovereignty of our dear nation which our founding fathers fought so hard to achieve. We demand that President Muhammadu Buhari must resign immediately for his inability to protect Nigerians. If he fails to resign immediately as demanded, we will mobilize for a protest match until he resigns his office as President of the country. A stitch in time they say saves nine.
