Super Eagles interim coach, Augustine Eguavoen has given reasons Kevin Akpoguma was not invited for the 2022 World Cup playoffs against Ghana this month. Akpoguma was handed his debut by Gernot Rohr and made two appearances in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. The 26-year-old, however, didn’t make the squad for the main competition in Cameroon. He has also been snubbed for the two-legged qualifiers against the Black Stars despite his impressive form in the German Bundesliga. “Slightly after the list was released, we still had opportunities to bring in one or two, and then Balogun was hurt- he couldn’t go because of his injury, and then we sent for Akpoguma to come. He didn’t, his club said no. “I want people to know that if you miss a call-up, that does not mean that you cannot be recalled. I think I’ve not worked with Akpoguma, but I have seen him closely. He is a very good player, no doubt, but for me, he couldn’t replace Balogun, Troost-Ekong, or Omeruo,” Eguavoen told Elegbete TV.
