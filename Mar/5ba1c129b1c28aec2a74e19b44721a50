Ahead of the forthcoming 2023 general election, a governorship aspirant in Rivers State, Prince Tonye T.J.T Princewill has commenced consultation with stakeholders of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the state. Princewill, who has been one of the contenders in previous governorship elections in the state, met with the Local Government leaders of the party on Monday, in a bid to succeed the current governor, Nyesom Wike in 2023. Shortly after the meetings, the son of the monarch of the Kalabari kingdom addressed newsmen, saying he was meeting with leaders to listen to feedback from key stakeholders. He said, “This whistle-stop tour is designed for me to consult before a declaration is made. You can’t put the cart before the horse. I needed to sit and look into the eyes of leaders and have them look into mine, so we can tell each other the truth. “A declaration that comes after this kind of a process, will stand the test of time. We have discussed all issues under the sun, from internal issues within the LGA, my father the King, how we will build a formidable front for 2023, the leader Rotimi Amaechi, our commitment to his Presidency and of course, my ambition. I’m encouraged on all fronts. They have all spoken very very well.”
