Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, has begged President Muhammadu Buhari not call the Super Eagles ahead of their match against Ghana. Omokri said Buhari should rather call the Black Stars of Ghana instead of the Super Eagles. In a tweet, the socio-political activist, wrote: “Dear General Buhari,” “The only appeal I make to you as Nigeria is set to face Ghana in a World Cup qualifier is please do NOT call the Super Eagles. “Whether video or audio call, please, please, and please, do NOT call. If you want to call, I can get you the number of the Black Stars of Ghana. “In the spirit of West African brotherhood, you may wish to call them to ‘inspire them’.” The Super Eagles of Nigeria would take on the Black Stars of Ghana in a World Cup qualifiers in a few days. Meanwhile, Nigerians believe Buhari’s calls to the Super Eagles is jinxed. The Super Eagles is believed to have lost all matches they played whenever they receive calls from Buhari.
