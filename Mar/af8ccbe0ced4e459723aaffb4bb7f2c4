The Confederation of African Football (CAF) is considering appointing non-African referees for the 2022 World Cup playoffs between Nigeria and Ghana. According to SportingLife, the idea is to ensure absolute fairness in the officiating between the West African rivals. It is understood meetings are already taking place to iron out the details. Apart from fierce rivalry, a lot is riding on these playoffs, including prize money of at least $12m for the five teams who will represent Africa in Qatar later this year. The Black Stars will host the Super Eagles on March 25 in Cape Coast. The reverse fixture will be played in Abuja four days later.
