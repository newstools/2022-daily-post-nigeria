The Imo State Police Command on Monday says it repelled an attack by gunmen suspected to be members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB)/Eastern Security Network (ESN) who threw petrol bombs and Improvised Explosive Devices(IED) that fell on a transit camp and a vehicle, shooting sporadically. In a release, Mike Abattam, Imo police spokesman, said the ESN militia wing on 28th March 2022 came in their numbers from the rear of the division, which is an ungoverned forest, threw petrol bombs but police operatives and some of the command’s tactical teams responded swiftly, engaging the hoodlums in a fierce gun duel. The command said its operatives prevented them from gaining entrance to the station and in the process forced the hoodlums into retreating and they escaped back into the forest with various degrees of bullet wounds. According to the police, “the operatives gave them a hot chase and while combing the bush the following items were recovered on the spot: three(3) undetonated explosives, four(4) expended AK-47 rifles ammunition, five(5) live cartridges, thirty-three (33) expended cartridges, two masks, one pump action gun and a motor saw machine. “Apart from the minimal damage on the transit camp and a vehicle, no life was lost. However, the police operative who sustained a minor gunshot injury has been treated.” The Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of Operation/Acting Commissioner of Police, Imo Command, who visited the station for an on-the-spot assessment of the situation commended the officers and men for their gallantry. He advised them not to relent in their efforts in combating violent crimes in the state until all criminal elements and their partners are apprehended and made to face the full wrath of the law. He further appealed to Imolites for their continuous support and collaboration by giving security agencies, especially the police, credible and timely information and to report any person seen treating bullet wounds or hiding within the community to the nearest police station for prompt action.
