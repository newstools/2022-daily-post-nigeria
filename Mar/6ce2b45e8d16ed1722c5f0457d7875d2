Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has called on the national leadership of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to call its Taraba chapter to order. The party had accused the Islamic organization of trying to cause religious conflict in the state. In its response on Friday, MURIC said the issue was not politics, but religious cleansing of Muslims in appointments. A statement by MURIC’s Director, Professor Ishaq Akintola alleged that Governor Darius Ishaku has been marginalizing Muslims in Taraba. Akintola said MURIC’s grudge against Ishaku has to do “with the way he has been trampling with impunity on Allah-given fundamental human rights” of Islam faithful. He called for good governance and responsible leadership that will ensure justice, equity and fairness to all irrespective of ethnicity or faith. “Governor Ishaku is taking his party’s state chapter to a dangerous arena by using the party to fight Muslims. It is not done. “Muslims are in the PDP in their millions. So they are in other political parties. It will not be so wise for the PDP to antagonise all Muslims in the party.” MURIC said the victimization of Islam adherents “deeply hurts Taraba Muslims”. The body added that the “denial of jobs to Muslims is aimed at impoverishing them”. The statement condemned the alleged “religious cleansing whereby Muslims are sacked and replaced by Christians”. Akintola urged the PDP headquarters to investigate its allegations, accusing Ishaku of “trying to cover up his crimes by whipping up political sentiment”.
