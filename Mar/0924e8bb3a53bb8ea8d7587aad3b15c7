Arsenal legend, Kanu Nwankwo, has urged Nigerians to support the Super Eagles of Nigeria ahead of their 2022 FIFA World Cup playoff against Ghana. The Black Stars will host the Super Eagles in the World Cup playoff first leg on Friday night in Kumasi. After the clash in Kumasi, Nigeria will then face Ghana in the second leg in Abuja. However, Kanu, a Nigerian legend, also believes that the Super Eagles are ready to beat Ghana. In a tweet via his Twitter handle on Thursday, Kanu wrote: “Good training and our boys are ready and know we need winning. “KAN U Believe it, come on is time to support our Super Eagles to victory Nigeria vs Ghana.” Meanwhile, Nigeria defeated Ghana 3-0 the last time both teams met in a World Cup qualifier at the Liberation Stadium in Port Harcourt back in 2001.
