A contender for the All Progressives Congress (APC) national chairmanship position, Malam Saliu Mustapha, has enjoined all leaders and party members to imbibe the progressive ideals and sustain the legacies of President Muhammadu Buhari after his tenure ends. Buhari had enjoined party members to exercise restraint towards having a successful national convention so the party does not lose power in 2023 as it happened to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2015. Dapo Okubanjo, media aide to Mustapha, in a statement explained that President Buhari’s message indicated his willingness to leave behind a strong party that would stand the test of time in the country’s political history. “This is exactly why we have been running a decent campaign devoid of mudslinging or any attempt to throw brickbats at anyone for exercising their right to compete for the party’s top job,” he said. He added that the race for the position of national chairman is not a contest for titles but of ideas and as such the group has always used every opportunity to reaffirm its intention to birth an idea that was mooted in the past but was never realized; The Progressives Institute (TPI). He reaffirmed that APC remains the party of choice for Nigerians and under their watch, saying that they would sustain the Buhari legacy and institutionalise the party as a haven for progressive ideals.
