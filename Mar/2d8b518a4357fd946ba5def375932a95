An Abeokuta Magistrates’ Court in Ogun State on Thursday sentenced a 38-year-old herdsman, Abdulahi Adamu, to seven years imprisonment for fraud and stealing cows worth over N43 million. Adamu, whose address was not given, was convicted on a three-count charge of conspiracy, fraud and stealing. Delivering her judgment, Magistrate Olajumoke Somefun, held that all the evidence presented by the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the convict is guilty as charged. Somefun noted that having found that the defendant is guilty as charged, she, however, sentenced him to seven years imprisonment with an option of N250,000 fine. She added that the option of fine shall be activated upon the restitution of all the 259 cows that were stolen by the convict. Earlier, the prosecutor, ASP Olakunle Shonibare, had told the court that the convict committed the offence on Sept. 12, at Alamutu Village via Rounder, in Abeokuta. Shonibare said that the convict conspired with one other person, now at large, and stole 259 cows belonging to seven persons. He said the convict is a herdsman and cattle were given to him to rear for people. The prosecutor said Adamu fraudulently agreed to help rear the cows and converted them to his own use with the intent to permanently deprive the owners of their cows, NAN reports.
