The Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC, has warned against illegal diversion and adulteration of Premium Motor Spirit popularly known as petrol. Jigawa State NSCDC Commandant, Mustapha Talba, made the warning on Tuesday to mark the 2022 World Civil Defence Day, held at the command headquarters in Dutse. The theme of this year’s day is “Civil Defence and management of displaced population in face of disasters and crises; role of volunteers and the fight against pandemics.” Talba said that the day was set aside to commemorate and appreciate the sacrifice of all actors in the civil defence on risk management. He explained that the command had recently arrested thirteen persons for diversion and adulteration of fuel. Talba said the command had taken measures to end the lingering scarcity of fuel happening across the country. He warned fuel marketers and filling stations to desist from any act capable of putting the the citizens into a difficult position. Talba said NSCDC would not relent on its effort to check diversion of petroleum products in the state and the country in general. He said the command had recorded over 2,000 criminal and civil cases out of which 110 are convicted.
