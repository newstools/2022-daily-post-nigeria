The House of Representatives Committee investigating the status of refineries in Nigeria has summoned the Finance Minister, Zainab Ahmed and the Group Managing Director of NNPC Limited, Mele Kyari. Ganiyu Johnson, the Chairman of the Committee, issued the summons after the officials sent representatives without an accompanying letter. He disclosed that Mr Kyari had sent a written submission to the committee but they were not satisfied with the response. The Chairman said the committee will not accept the appearance of the representatives and asked the officials to appear on Thursday, next week. This investigation is ongoing at a time when Nigerians are struggling to get fuel and other petroleum products. Many Nigerians believe the situation would have been different if the nations’ refineries were functioning. The committee also summoned other officials, including the Accountant General of the Federation, Auditor General of the Federation and the Director-General, Budget Office of the Federation. Others are Chief Executive, Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission and the Chief Executive, Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Authority.
