The Yoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemo, also known locally as Sunday Igboho, has warned against another world war. He spoke in a first video, which surfaced after he was released on Monday by the Government of Republic of Benin, after about 231 days in detention. In the video, the embattled Yoruba activist was sighted discussing the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia. He said, “Let’s hope that this Ukraine crisis won’t lead to a third world war. May God not let us witness war in the world”. Igboho, who was arrested in Benin’s capital, Cotonou on accusations of “criminal association”, in July 2, 2021, was released on Monday to attend to his health. According to his lawyer, the pioneer of Oduduwa republic will not be allowed back to Nigeria until the completion of his case.
