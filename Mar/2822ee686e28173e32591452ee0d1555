The Nigerian Army (NA) has warned the public of a fake online recruitment portal being circulated on social media and other online platforms fraudulently advertising recruitment of candidates into NA 83 Regular Recruit Intake. The army in a statement signed by its Director of Public Relations, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, said the recruitment portal is aimed at defrauding Nigerians. The link to the fake portal in circulation is: https://recruitment.army.mil.ng/darrr.” The statement read: “This unwholesome development, the NA wishes to clearly inform the general public that there is no ongoing recruitment, as published in the fake portal. The information is false, misleading and aimed at defrauding unsuspecting members of the public. “The general public is, therefore, enjoined to be wary of fake online recruitment vendors who are desperately hunting for victims.” The army noted that recruitment advertisements placed by the Army are usually published in national dailies.
