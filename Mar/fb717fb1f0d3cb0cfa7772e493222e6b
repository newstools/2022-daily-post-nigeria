Super Eagles interim technical adviser, Augustine Eguavoen has said that his team doesn’t need distractions ahead of their 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifier against the Black Stars of Ghana later this month. Eguavoen said this while insisting that he already knows his starting XI to face Ghana. Nigeria and Ghana will clash in a two-legged playoff later on March 25 and 29, respectively. The overall winner between the two West African giants will proceed to the World Cup in Qatar later this year. “We have the eleven that will start,” Eguavoen told Elegbete TV. “We don’t need distractions, all we need is support to cross this hurdle,” he said. Eguavoen added, “Etebo I have worked with closely, Bonke I have not and I have had no chance to go to France to watch him play. “I have watched Etebo closely, I have watched him closely when he played in the U23s and when he played for the former coach Gernot Rohr in the Super Eagles. “Etebo coming in now does not say he would be in the starting line-up.”
