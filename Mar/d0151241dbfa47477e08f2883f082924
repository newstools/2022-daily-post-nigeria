Notorious terrorist, Bello Turji has said the government cannot hinder illegal firearms in circulation nor can it prevent terrorists from buying petrol for their operations. DAILY POST recalls that in Zamfara State in September 2021, restrictions were placed to minimize the activities of bandits in the state. The notorious terrorist spoke with Trust TV in an interview as part of a documentary tagged, “Nigeria’s Banditry: The Inside Story”. The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), however, had last year mandated all telecommunication operators in the country to stop extending services to Zamfara and its environs. Many bandit leaders and their foot soldiers, during the restriction, were reported killed during several raids in the state. According to Turji, “It is not right to deny Fulani entry into Shinkafi; it’s a local government for all citizens. If you deny Fulani entry, where are they supposed to go?” He explained that if someone buys just a measure of maize, they confiscate it; or if he or she buys a loaf of bread they will say you are buying it for Turji, asking if it is only Turji who eats out of all the people here? He assured that those who failed to prevent the circulation of arms in Nigeria would not prevent them from buying petrol, which even a little kid knows where it can be obtained
