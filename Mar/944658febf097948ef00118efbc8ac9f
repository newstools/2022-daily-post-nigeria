The Ogun State Command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Kolawole Taiwo, has said the corps impounded a bus loaded with jerry cans filled with petrol. Taiwo said at exactly 4:37pm on Wednesday, the NSCDC pipeline patrol team in Ogere, along the NNPC Pipeline Right of Ways (PROWs), had impounded the unregistered Ford bus hidden in a forest close to the pipeline. The petrol, he said, was suspected to have been siphoned from a vandalised point close to the area. “Immediately, the intelligence report as of the early morning the following day revealed that vandalism operations were meant to be simultaneously carried out along Ogere right of way but our intensive monitoring activities aborted their plans. “Consequently, some kegs filled with petroleum products (PMS) were discovered through combing and searching of Igbo Olobo forest/bush for several hours. “Meanwhile, there were 106 kegs in total which had been moved to the Antenna tent for proper documentation and immediate decantation transfer and subsequent decantation to the NNPC authorities,” Taiwo told DAILY POST on Sunday. He added that all efforts to arrest the vandals were abortive.
