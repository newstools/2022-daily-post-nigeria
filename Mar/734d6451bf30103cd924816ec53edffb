No fewer than 11 lunatics and miscreants have been removed from the streets of Ado and Ikere Ekiti by the Ekiti State Government for proper rehabilitation. The state Commissioner for Women Affairs and Social Development, Alhaja Maryam Ogunlade, made this known in Ado Ekiti. She said that the exercise was aimed at providing proper care as well as psycho-social support for genuine beggars, miscreants and lunatics, adding that they would be reintegrated into the society and their respective families as soon as they are fit enough to do so. Ogunlade explained further that the move was to boost security of lives and property of the people, noting that investigations had revealed that kidnappers and miscreants sometimes disguise as beggars and lunatics to carry out their nefarious activities. Stressing that the exercise was carried out according to global best practices, the Commissioner said that it was done in collaboration with law enforcement agencies, so as to avoid undue interruption and resistance. She highlighted categories of persons targeted during the exercise to include street beggars, destitute, miscreants and lunatics, assuring that it would be carried out across the state. The Executive Secretary, Office of Disability Affairs, Mrs. Olabisi Fatoba, assured that adequate arrangements had been made for the care of those picked and that they would be allowed to join their families and the society when they are considered fully rehabilitated.
