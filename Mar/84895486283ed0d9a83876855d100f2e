Nigerians, celebrities and politicians alike have reacted to the tragic death of Dr. Chinelo Megafu. Dr. Chinelo was among the many passengers shot dead by terrorists as they travelled from Abuja to Kaduna on board the ill-fated commercial train. Gunmen suspected to be terrorists bombed the Abuja-Kaduna train between Katari and Rigina axis on Monday night leaving hundreds of passengers dead in the attack. As DAILY POST captured it, many passengers were said to have been initially kidnapped including the Zamfara State former deputy Governor, Mallam Ibrahim Wakkala Liman, during the deadly attack. Dr. Chinelo, a popular presence on Twitter, was among those who were shot dead as an unascertained number of passengers also sustained various degrees of injury as a result of gunshots.  What made Dr. Chinelo’s death more heart-shattering was that before she died, she was able to raise her voice calling for prayers on Twitter. However, instead of prayers, she received some derogatory comments from those, many Twitter users have described, as ‘Igbophobic.’ Reacting to this, a former lawmaker, Shehu Sani, said “Dr Chinelo’s last tweet is a powerful and angelic phrase that will forever remind us of all the victims and their tragic experiences. “We all need to wear a T-shirt with the quotation of Dr Chinelo Megafu’s last tweet.” Mr Macaroni tweeted, “Those same set of people that attacked the late Chinelo are the same set that attacked and trolled me when the police brutalized me. These are sycophants who are loyal only to their political gods. They care not for this country and have no conscience whatsoever left in them. Mr. P of the PSquare band tweeted, “We complain about the old people in power! But we the young people how far? All she said was “PRAYER FOR ME” And some evil people carry am for head!👎🏾
“Nigeria failed Chinelo, Nigerians mocked her. I AM SO ANGRY RIGHT NOW! “Just went through last night’s comments under Dr Chinelo’s tweet, and all I can say is Some people are the Devil them self. All Chinelo said was “Pray for me.” That is all she said. She was then targeted and subjected to abuse by some Evil people! May God comfort her Family!” Emeka The Stalion aka Blaqbonez, tweeted, “my country keeps showing us new levels of how much it has failed us, “you think we failed you enough yesterday? we’d fail you a lot more today”. Nobody’s safe except the govt people in their bulletproof trucks bought with money they stole from us. Whew
RIP Chinelo.” Samuel Otigba said, “All Dr Chinelo asked for was a prayer in her final moments. She didn’t ask for money to be treated, she didn’t ask to be rescued, she didn’t criticise the government in their failing moment to protect her citizens, all she wanted was a miracle to live and Nigeria(ns) failed her.”
