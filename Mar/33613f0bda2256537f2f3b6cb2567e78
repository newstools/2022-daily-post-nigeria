The House of Representatives has asked the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice to refrain from deleting section 84(12) of the Constitution until all legal actions are exhausted. The House reached the resolution after debating a point of order moved by Ndudi Elumelu, the minority leader, on Wednesday. Elumelu had raised the point of order on the judgment and asked the House to act by appealing the judgment of the Federal High Court. Speaking on the judgment, the Majority Leader, Ado Doguwa, described the judgment as a nullity. He stated that the House must appeal. Similarly, the Chief Whip, Mohammed Monguno slammed the court judgment. “I cannot allow the House, which I am part of and lead to be ridiculed. “The section was to deepen democracy and expand the frontier of our jurisprudence,” Gbajabiamila said while speaking on the controversy. He described those who challenged the section in court as meddlesome interlopers. Consequently, Mr Gbajabiamila said the House will write the National Judicial Council on the judgment. It would be recalled that the Nigerian Bar Association has also raised concerns about the judgment.
