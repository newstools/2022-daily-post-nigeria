A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Alhaji Ahmadu Yaro, popularly known as ‘Coca-Cola’ in Kaduna, on Sunday, said any attempt to dismiss the party’s chances because of its internal crisis will fail as the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) bloc will continue to work for the progress of the party. Yaro, also, a former state chairman of the defunct CPC, who expressed this during an interview with newsmen in Kaduna on Sunday, said that as members of the defunct party that went into the merger with other political parties which formed the APC, they will not only remain in the party but will resolve all crisis for the progress of the party. He stated that one of the founders of CPC, knew the difficulties the members went through alongside Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), a faction of All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) and the new Peoples Democratic Party (n-PDP) members including President Buhari to form the APC in the year 2013 and as such they will not allow the party to disintegrate. He cautioned the CPC members in APC not to form a new political party, or join any newly formed party ahead of the 2023 general elections. He urged them to remain in the APC despite the challenges facing the party, as all crises will soon be resolved. He expressed optimism that the party will overcome the current leadership crisis because there are still party members that believe in the party and President Muhammadu Buhari’s leadership. Alhaji Yaro pointed out that the ruling party had done its best in fulfilling most of the campaign promises made to Nigerians from year 2015 to date, just as he assured party loyalists that APC will not collapse before 2023.
