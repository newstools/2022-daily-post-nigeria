Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State has condemned the razing of the country home of the President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Prof George Obiozor, at Awo-Omanma in the Oru East Local Government Area of Imo State. DAILY POST had reported that the attack took place at about 12:30 am on Saturday morning after the gunmen chased away a security guard on duty in the compound. It was gathered that the suspects used Improvised Explosives Devices, IED and petrol bombs to raze down the building. Reacting in a statement he personally signed, Uzodinma vowed that his government is working in concert with security agencies to identify and punish the perpetrators of the act. Describing the attack as cowardly and height of desperation, he regretted that desperate politicians who believe in violence were yet to sheath their swords in spite of a repeated appeal to that effect. According to him, the time of those who unleash this kind of mayhem in the state is over as he promised to hunt them down. Uzodinma wondered why the bandits should attack the home of a man who is not a politician but a statesman working for the good of the entire Igbo race. The Governor said it was shameful that both the sponsors and perpetrators of the violence deployed their malicious attack on an innocent man. He, therefore, commiserated with Prof Obiozor and assured Imo people that the Government will continue to do all within its constitutional power to protect lives and property in the state.
