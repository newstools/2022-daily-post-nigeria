The leading opposition party in Osun State, People’s Democratic Party PDP is holding its primary election to select a candidate who will represent the party in the April 16 governorship election in Osun State. On Monday, a few hours to the primary, four aspirants contesting on the platform of the PDP withdrew from the primary, leaving Senator Ademola Adeleke and Dotun Babayemi.  Aspirants who announced their withdrawal ahead of the party’s primaries were Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi, Ademola Adeleke’s nephew, Bamidele Adeleke; a former Secretary to the Osun State Government, Fatai Akinbade and Omirin Emmanuel Olusanya respectively. However, at the Osogbo Township Stadium where the National Working Committee is holding the primary for candidates, only Senator Adeleke was present while the other candidate is holding a parallel primary at WOCDIF Centre, Ring Road, Osogbo.  Speaking with journalists at the Osogbo Township Stadium, Chairman of the Osun PDP primary election, Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, described the parallel primary organised elsewhere as illegal. He said the only primary election recognised is the one organised by a committee set up by the National Working Committee of the party. Meanwhile, Senator Adeleke has cast his vote in the ongoing process.
