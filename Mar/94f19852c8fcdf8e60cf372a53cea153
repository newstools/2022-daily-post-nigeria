National leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu and the embattled governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi met in Abuja on Friday. Special Assistant to the Governor of Ebonyi State, Francis Nwaze, made the disclosure via a post on his official Facebook page.  “Presidential hopeful and Governor of Ebonyi State, Engr. David Umahi, FNSE, FNATE meets Alh. Bola Ahmed Tinubu in Abuja on Friday, March 11, 2022,” he wrote. The post, however, failed to reveal details of the meeting but may not be unconnected to the sacking of the governor by a Federal High Court in Abuja and the current crisis rocking the party.
