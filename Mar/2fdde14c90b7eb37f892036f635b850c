Manchester United forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, has told his teammates that they can beat any team if they ‘work hard and stand together as one.’ Ronaldo said this on Saturday after scoring his first hat-trick since rejoining the club as Man United defeated Tottenham 3-2 at Old Trafford. Speaking after the match, Ronaldo, in a post via his Instagram account, sent a message to his teammates and a warning to Man United’s rivals. He said: “Tremendously happy with my first hat-trick since I came back to Old Trafford! Nothing beats the feeling of being back on the pitch and help the team with goals and effort. “We’ve proven once again that we can beat any team in any given day, as long as we work hard and stand together as one. There are no limits for Man United! No matter what! Let’s go, Devils!” Ronaldo will now hope to lead Ralf Rangnick’s side to victory when they host Atletico Madrid in the UEFA Champions League round of 16 second-leg tie on Tuesday.
