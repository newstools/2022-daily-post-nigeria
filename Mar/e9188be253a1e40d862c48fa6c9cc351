Kanunta Kanu, a brother of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has said the Nigerian government should learn from the war between Russia and Ukraine. Kanu warned that “men” would take to the streets and defend themselves if the Federal Government continues its aggression in the southeast. In a tweet, the brother to IPOB leader noted that they would begin the defence within the next 48 hours. According to Kanu: “Dear @GovNigeria: Let it be clear that 2022 is not 1967. Take a lesson from the Russian-Ukrainian war. “If you continue with your aggression in Biafra, men will be on the street of #Biafraland within 48 hours. We have to defend ourselves @FCDOGovUK @StateDept @UKParliament @UN.” His brother has been detained by the Department of State Services, DSS, over his agitation for Biafra. The Nigerian government had dragged Kanu to court over charges bordering on terrorism. The IPOB leader had been detained since June 2021, after his extraordinary rendition from Kenya.
