Dickson Yeboah, a Professor of International Trade Negotiations, says Nigeria needs more negotiators to lift the country out of poverty. The scholar was formerly the Head, Intensive Trade Negotiation Skills Unit at the World Trade Organisation (WTO). He told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday that training more trade specialists would boost the strength of Nigeria’s negotiating team. Noting that the country is big, the expert called for the preparation of 1,000 citizens to be skillful in talks. “Trade negotiation skills is a way out of poverty, recession or economic slowdown”, Yeboah said. He warned that Nigeria may lose out on big investment deals if its negotiators are not well-grounded. “They cannot attract anything because they liaise with the outside world. We need to have effective negotiators. “And it is not just going to talk, it needs preparations, it needs information and research,” he added. Yeboah urged Nigeria to emulate countries in Asia that have used training on skills to their advantage. “Because they know it is a way out of recession, it is a way to advance the economy of a country”, he said. The professor added that negotiation is not only about goods and listed intellectual property, trade in services, investments, agriculture, among others. Yeboah recalled that in 1986, the WTO negotiated the ‘positive list approach’ where a country focused on a particular sector. “If Nigeria was comfortable with tourism, Nigeria will open up only that sector. But now in the 21st century, our partners are more interested in using the ‘negative list approach’. “This is why it is important to expose Nigerians to the new ways of negotiating agreements and keep them abreast of issues,’’ he explained.
