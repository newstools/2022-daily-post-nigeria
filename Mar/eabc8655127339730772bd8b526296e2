The Charman Zamfara State Taskforce Committee Chairman, Abubakar Muhammad Dauran has warned some police officers who go round filling stations in the name of the security task force harassing people and staff to desist. The chairman who gave the warning in Gusau said the committee did not assign any police unit to do the monitoring except he is a member of the committee. He advised that such officers must display their IDs authorising them to perform such functions. “The residents of the state should also note the fact that no member of the task force is allowed to collect a Kobo from anybody. If he does, he should be reported immediately to the Task Force headquarters in Gusau, the State capital. “The Task Force on security was constituted to fight non-compliance of the executive orders by Governor Matawalle and is constituted right from the state capital up to the local government levels and the members are always alert in discharging their responsibilities” The chairman also called on the managers of various filling stations to watch the movement of such undesirable elements who move in the name of Task Force on security.
