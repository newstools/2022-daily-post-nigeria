Super Eagles assistant captain, William Troost-Ekong, has revealed the team’s major strength ahead of their 2022 FIFA World Cup second leg playoff against Ghana on Tuesday evening at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja. Troost-Ekong said that Super Eagles’ major strength is that they have only conceded one goal in their last five matches. The Watford star also explained that Nigeria have players who know how to score goals, including Odion Ighalo and Emmanuel Dennis. DAILY POST reports that the Super Eagles played a goalless draw against Ghana in the first leg last Friday in Kumasi. “I think you can look at it in two ways. We have players known to score goals, including Emmanuel Dennis and Odion Ighalo [who were on the bench] and I would back all of them,” Troost-Ekong said at his pre-match press conference ahead of Tuesday’s clash at the MKO Abiola Stadium. “I think they are going to feel even more challenged to score and show everyone that they can do that. “Secondly, we have only conceded one goal in the last five games, so maybe that’s where our strength lies as well.”
