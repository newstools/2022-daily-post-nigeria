Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that all American companies must leave the Russian market immediately because it is flooded with Ukrainian blood. Zelensky stated this while addressing U.S. Congress on Wednesday, via webinar from Ukraine amid Russian attack on Ukraine on multiple fronts. He wants the U.S. to put pressure on companies in their districts that finance the Russian military machine. Zelensky said, “All American companies must leave Russia from their market, leave their market immediately because it is flooded with our blood. Ladies and gentlemen, members of Congress, please take the lead, if you have companies in your districts who finance the Russian military machine leaving business in Russia, you should put pressure. “I am asking to make sure that the Russians do not receive a single penny that they use to destroy people in Ukraine.” Recall that the war between Ukraine and Russia started last month and many casualties have already been recorded.
