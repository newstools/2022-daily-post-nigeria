A Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Olumuyiwa Akinboro, has said all the critical sectors in the nation are in shambles and need a forthright, honest and result-oriented leader to fix. Lamenting that nobody wants to live in Nigeria anymore, Akinboro said the level of hardship and economic woes across the country was alarming. Speaking to journalists at the PDP National Secretariat on Thursday where the Presidential nomination form was purchased for the Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, Akinboro said Nigeria needed a leader who can take it out of the woods. “Nobody wants to live in the country again. There is so much hardship and suffering. Security is worsening by the day; our infrastructure is collapsing; we are going through a lot of pain as a people and we have seen in Tambuwal, the leader that can take the nation out of the woods” Akinboro said. “Tambuwal’s extraordinary performance as the Speaker of the House of Representatives, particularly in uniting members from across the country as well as his landmark achievements in developing all sectors of the economy in Sokoto State had endeared him to Nigerians in our earnest desire for national unity, stability and economic progress”, Akinboro said. Speaking on zoning, Akinboro stressed that Nigerians have moved beyond such consideration in the search for purposeful leadership which transcends ethnic and religious affiliations. He called for Nigerians from all walks of life to be sensitized to ensure that the right person is delivered to Nigeria as the next president. The Senior Advocate hinted that Tambuwal’s nomination form was purchased with individual contributions by concerned Nigerians from across the country, who are focused on ushering a development and people-oriented leadership for the country by 2023.
