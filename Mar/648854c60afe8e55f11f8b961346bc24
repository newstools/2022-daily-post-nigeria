Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has claimed it is virtually impossible for his team to win a Treble this season. The Spaniard also insisted he is not motivated by the prospect of lifting three trophies. City is top of the Premier League and is through to the last eight of both the Champions League and FA Cup. But despite winning eight trophies in his six years at the Etihad, Guardiola claims sports at a high level is difficult. “It doesn’t motivate me, absolutely zero, lower than zero. “These are fairy tales. The reality is tough. Sport at a high level is so difficult,” Guardiola said.
