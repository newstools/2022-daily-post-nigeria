Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick has criticized Slovenian referee, Slavko Vincic following his side’s Champions League defeat to Atletico Madrid on Tuesday night. Rangnick said Vincic made it ‘easy’ for Atletico Madrid to waste time in their Champions League round of 16 second-leg 1-0 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford. Renan Lodi’s first-half header ensured Atletico Madrid eliminated Man United from the Champions League. Atletico Madrid qualified for the quarter-final stage on a 2-1 aggregate win. Speaking at his post-match press conference, Rangnick said: “He (the referee) made it pretty easy for Atletico to do their time-wasting antics and it didn’t make it any easier for us. “That’s how they have played for the last 10 years, they always play like that. I was not surprised.”
