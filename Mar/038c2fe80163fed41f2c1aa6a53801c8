Chairman of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Cross River State, Venatius Ikem, has announced that they will definitely enforce the judgment delivered at the High Court Abuja on Monday. The judgement ordered the 20 members who, alongside Governor Ben Ayade, defected to the All Progressives Congress, APC, in May 2021, to vacate their seats in the state House of Assembly. Ikem said the judgement is heartwarming and that their mandate has been restored, adding that it is a victory for all that is good. He vowed that, “We will enforce the judgment in accordance with extant due processes. It’s not rocket science to enforce a judgment of the courts. That’s the least of our concerns right now.” Reacting, the APC said there was no cause for alarm over the judgement, maintaining that the state is for the ruling party. In a statement by its Publicity Secretary, Erasmus Ekpang, said that the appellate court will do justice to the matter as they will, of course, appeal it. “The Federal High Court judgment that was given against our lawmakers is nothing to worry about. “We trust that the appellate court will do justice as we file our appeal.”
