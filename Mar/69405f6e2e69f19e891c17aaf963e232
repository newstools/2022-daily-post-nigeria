Manchester United have been handed a major boost ahead of their Premier League derby with Manchester City on Sunday evening at Etihad. Man United confirmed this in a post via their website on Wednesday. Man United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, received a major boost with midfielder Scott McTominay in contention to return to the Red Devils’ clash with City this weekend. McTominay had produced a brilliant display during Man United’s Premier League 4-2 win over Leeds United last month. But the Scottish international missed Man United’s Champions League round of 16 first-leg draw against Atletico Madrid and also their 0-0 draw against Watford after illness ruled him out of those encounters. However, he was back with the squad at Carrington on Tuesday. McTominay trained with the likes of Harry Maguire and Jadon Sancho.
