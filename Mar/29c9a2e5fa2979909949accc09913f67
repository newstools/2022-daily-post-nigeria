The former Governor of Lagos State has described his competitors for the 2023 APC presidential ticket as unstable. Tinubu, while addressing members of the All Progressives Congress, APC caucus in the House of Representatives on Wednesday, said he is the most competent. The national leader of the APC, who is rumoured not to have proper education certificates, claimed that he has a first-class degree while addressing the lawmakers. Tinubu also attacked other aspirants, saying that they offer nothing other than “questions and doubt.” “Most people have nothing to offer but questions and creating doubt. I am not here to be defensive. I am here to tell you that I am one of the best products that you can sell. I am the only one in the race that is most competent, most qualified to be your president come year 2023,” he said. Ado Doguwa, the Leader of the House, assured Tinubu that they will work with him. It would be recalled that Doguwa led some Northern lawmakers to visit Tinubu in London while he was sick.
