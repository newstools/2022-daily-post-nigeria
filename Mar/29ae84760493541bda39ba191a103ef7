Former Chelsea midfielder, Michael Essien, has sent a ‘good luck’ message to the Black Stars of Ghana ahead of their 2022 FIFA World Cup playoff against Nigeria in Kumasi on Friday night. Essien, a former Black Stars captain, disclosed this in a tweet via his Twitter handle on Friday. He tweeted: “Good luck @GhanaBlackstars #ComeOnBoy.” After tonight’s clash, Nigeria will host Ghana in the return leg in Abuja on Tuesday. The winner after both legs will qualify for the World Cup in Qatar later this year. Meanwhile, another former Black Stars captain, Asamoah Gyan, has urged the national team to approach their tie against Nigeria like wounded lions.
