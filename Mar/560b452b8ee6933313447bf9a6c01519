Interim coach of the Super Eagles, Augustine Eguavoen, has hinted that he did not make the decision to recall Onazi Ogenyi to the national team squad. The Al-Adalah FC midfielder has been included in the 32-man squad for the 2020 World Cup playoffs this month. However, Onazi also made the standby list. Still, his recall has stirred up controversy, with many surprised by the invitation. Eguavoen in a chat with reporters on Monday, admitted the 2013 AFCON winner was invited to “pacify everybody”. “Onazi, good player. Whether he’s still good and can play at that level, we don’t know. “But that’s why I said to pacify everybody, to ensure there’s harmony here, put him on the standby. While he’s on the standby, I have the final say,” Eguavoen said. The former Lazio and Trabzonspor midfielder was last invited to the Super Eagles in 2018.
