Simon Ekpa, a self-acclaimed disciple of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has mocked the immediate past governor of Anambra State, Willie Obiano over his arrest by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC. Recall that Obiano was nabbed by the operatives of the anti-graft agency on Thursday at Lagos airport hours after handing over to the current governor of the state, Charles Soludo. Reacting, Ekpa, in a tweet on his official handle on Friday said it was a shame that Obiano could not spend a night in his personal home as a former governor. Ekpa alleged that the embattled former governor championed the proscription of IPOB in 2017. He said, “It is a shame that Obiano couldn’t spend one more night in his so glorified Nigeria, we expected him to run to Abuja immediately but little did we know he was already on his way to America where he will be enjoying security with his families after proscribing IPOB in 2017”
