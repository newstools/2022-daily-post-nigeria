The 14 members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the Adamawa State House of Assembly have decided to buy a re-election nomination form for the state Governor, Rt Hon Ahmadu Fintiri. Fintiri, who is a former speaker of the House, has since becoming Governor in 2019 enjoyed much goodwill of the House which is composed of 14 PDP members and 11 members of the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC). The PDP lawmakers, led in a press briefing on Tuesday by the Speaker, Aminu Iya Abbas, said Governor Fintiri had done enough in his first term to merit a vote of confidence and support with his return as governor for a second term. “In furtherance of our vote of confidence on his Excellency, Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, we the PDP members in the House have decided to get his re-election nomination and expression of interest forms for him,” Aminu Iya Abbas said. The speaker, who was flanked by most of the PDP House members during the press briefing in his office at the House of Assembly Complex in Yola, said all the 14 PDP members would contribute the N21 million to get the governorship nomination and expression of interest forms for Fintiri. “As a House, we do our duties as we should, we carry out our oversight functions dutifully, so what we are doing does not change anything,” the speaker said in response to a question on whether the lawmakers were doing the right thing to fund a possible return of Fintiri as governor. The decision to buy forms for Fintiri came against a situation by which Fintiri has not formally declared intention to go for a rerun ticket of the PDP towards the 2023 election. It is however quietly taken that the governor will make such a move, which is most probably the reason why nobody within the PDP in the state has voiced intention to run for the office of governor. The opposite is the case in opposition APC in the state where no less than five people have announced the intention to run for the APC governorship ticket.
