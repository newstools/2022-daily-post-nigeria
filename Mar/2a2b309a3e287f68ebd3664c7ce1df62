Former Manchester United striker, Ruud van Nistelrooy is set to become manager of a European club, PSV Eindhoven. Dutch publication Eindhovens Dagblad reports that Van Nistelrooy is the ‘most important candidate’ to replace Roger Schmidt at PSV, adding that the Dutch club are ready to ‘bet’ on the 45-year-old. Van Nistelrooy is set to step up from his role with the reserve team and into senior management for the first time in his coaching career. The former Real Madrid star has been around the PSV coaching set-up since 2013. He first started working with the under-17s, becoming manager of the under-19s in 2018. Van Nistelrooy stepped up to take charge of Jong PSV last year and now he is the likeliest successor to Schmidt, who is due to leave at the end of the season.
