A former federal lawmaker and activist, Shehu Sani has revealed the exact words of former President Olusegun Obasanjo when both men were sentenced to life imprisonment in 1995. Recall that Obasanjo was arrested and convicted of being part of a planned coup in 1995, having been openly critical of the government of military dictator, Sani Abacha. He was imprisoned despite protesting his innocence and there in the prison, Obasanjo was said to have become a born again Christian. Also, Sani, a human rights activist was arrested and jailed by successive past military regimes. Sani found luck and was released from life imprisonment when democracy was restored in Nigeria in 1999. He went ahead to contest the Kaduna Central Senatorial District which he won on the platform of the All Progressive Congress on 28 March 2015 Recalling his days with the former military head of state who turned 85 years last week, Sani tweeted, “When the Military Tribunal Judge in Lagos sentenced Obj to life imprisonment for treason and sentenced me and Dr Beko to life imprisonment plus 7 years for treason, Obj turned to me and asked ‘young man, which one are you going to start with, the 7 years or the life imprisonment?'” Sani recalled yesterday that when they were in Kiri Kiri prison together, no prisoner wanted to serve Obasanjo because he hardly remains food for the boys who washed their dishes.
