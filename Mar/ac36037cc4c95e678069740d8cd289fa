Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, Youth Wing, Saturday, reacted to comments by the Chairman of Muslim Rights Concern, MURIC, Bauchi State chapter, Idrees Safiyanu Gambo’s against members of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG vying for elective position in 2023. DAILY POST earlier reported that MURIC, in a statement by the Bauchi Chairman, warned that any political party that picks any member of the RCCG will kiss the Aso Rock goodbye. But the National Chairman of CAN’s Youth Wing, Belusochukwu Enwere, who spoke in Owerri, Lambasted MURUC, arguing that MURIC’s statement was an insult to Christians and an abuse of the freedom of the people. He said, MURIC’s statement shows the low level of the said group and how blind they are in the 21st century. ”For MURIC to say they are challenging RCCG for having the effrontery to launch a political and good governance wing is an insult to our fathers and the entire Christians in Nigeria, especially the young people”. “MURIC calling another faith-based group that will queue behind any candidate from RCCG a traitor is an abuse of office and their freedom of association as stipulated in the Nigerian constitution, and their warning to Islamic organizations and Muslim communities against supporting RCCG is indirectly telling them not to support a Christian candidate in 2023. “It is the turn of Christians to produce the next president of the country in 2023. We call on them to join hands with us to preach for peace, oneness and help make Nigeria a better place where both Christians and Muslims will be seen as one and have equal rights in all ramifications.”Vanguard quoted him as saying.
