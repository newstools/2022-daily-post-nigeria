Bandits operating in Kaduna State have sent over 60 communities in Birni Gwari Local Goverment Area of the State on exile. This is as properties worth millions of Naira, including animals were destroyed by the bandits. This was confirmed by the Chairman of the Birnin Gwari Emirate Progressives Union, Alhajji Salisu Haruna (BEPU) in Kaduna on Saturday. According to him, about 60 villages were sacked by bandits as at 2021, adding that, as at today, no human being was living there. He said the people from those villages, who are largely farmers, have been forcefully sent on exile by bandits. In a similar development, the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU), is worried that at least 145 communities, scattered in six local government areas, had been displaced. The President of SOKAPU, Jonathan Asake said 28 communities, including Kihoro-Libere, Bakin Kogi, Umiko, Magunguna and Idazo, had been sacked in Kajuru Local Government, while 33 communities, including Chikwale, Idum, Muruchi and Kwasau Legede were displaced in Kachia. According to him, 45 communities had been sacked in Chikun Local Government, eight were sacked in Kaura and nine in Kauru, while Zangon Kataf had 22 displaced villages. He, however, said efforts had been made by some of the displaced persons to return to their communities, and cited examples with Idazo, Unguwan Shaba and Magunguna villages in Kajuru Local Government, where some residents returned to clear their farms.
