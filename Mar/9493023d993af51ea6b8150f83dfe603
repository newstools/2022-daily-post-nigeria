Chuks Ibegbu, the immediate past spokesman of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has warned of the dangers of denying Igbo nation Nigeria’s presidential seat in the upcoming 2023 general elections in the country. Ibegbu gave the warning during an enlarged meeting with Nigerian socio-cultural and political youth groups’ leaders held in Umuahia, on Friday. The Ohanaeze chieftain noted that Igbos will feel they are not part of Nigeria if denied the opportunity, calling on the citizens and political actors to rally round the Igbo nation for the interest of justice, equity and fairness. “The youths, in particular, may be more restive and no amount of force can check their anger this time, and I advise political parties to zone respective presidential tickets to the southeast of the Igbo extraction”, he also added. On purported endorsement of ex-Nigerian Vice President, Atiku Abubakar for 2023 Presidency by Senate Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe, and other notable Igbo leaders, Mazi Ibegbu, noted that Abaribe did not endorse the Peoples Democratic Party chieftain as was rumoured. According to the Igbo chieftain, “Atiku visited the Senate caucus and there was no time they endorsed him”. Ibegbu also called on Nigerian electorates to be prepared to use their voting power to effect a positive change in their lives. He equally admonished Nigerians to be conscious of their electoral power and use it to bring in good leaders and chase away bad ones. “This is the first revolutionary move to conscientise the Nigeria electorates”, he submitted.
