Former Nigeria winger, Tijani Babangida has said Austin Eguavoen will have a headache selecting the team to face Ghana in the World Cup playoff later this month. Babangida said this while speaking on how the Super Eagles can conquer perennial rivals Ghana. Nigeria and Ghana will do battle later this month with the eventual winner assured of a place in Qatar 2022. The first leg comes up in Ghana on March 25th at the Cape Coast Stadium, after which both countries meet again in the reverse fixture scheduled for the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja four days later. And Babangida, a former Super Eagles winger predicts that Nigeria will overcome Ghana and proceed to Qatar if the technical crew selects the right strikers for the crucial qualifiers “There is no doubt that the current strikers in the Super Eagles are not doing badly in Europe,” Babangida told Ghanasoccernet. “The likes of Osimhen, Ighalo, Sadiq and others are banging the goals for their respective clubs and it’s a sign of good things to come for the team.” “Again, this will definitely give Eguavoen a serious headache in terms of who to select for the game against Ghana. “If he gets the right strikers to start, then the team will pick the ticket for Qatar.”
