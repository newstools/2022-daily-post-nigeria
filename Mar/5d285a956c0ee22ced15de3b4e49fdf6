A coalition of Northern Youths, Nigeria Movement Forum (NMF), has condemned the call for the sack of Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Leo Irabor, and Chief of Defence Intelligence, Maj.-Gen. Samuel Adebayo. The Secretary of NMF, Mr Adamu Muhktar, in a statement on Friday in Abuja, described the call as reckless and unpatriotic. Muhktar said the call by another group, Northern Advocacy for Peace (NAP), alleging the resurgence of bandits attacks on communities in the North East and North West regions was sponsored by enemies of the state. He said NMF had since dissociated itself from the call, urging NAP to do a soul searching on the performance of the Armed Forces of Nigeria in recent times. According to him, the reign of the present service chiefs, led by Gen. Irabor, has made lots of deliberate efforts to ensure peace and stability in the country. “The efforts of the armed forces under Irabor, have ensured that our brothers and sisters in the Northeast had a peaceful 2021 Christmas celebration unlike in the past. “We are also witnesses to the several numbers of insurgents and their families that have surrendered to our troops. It came as a result of intense military operations. “We also acknowledge the frequent change in leadership of the terrorist groups. Our military is pursuing and ensuring that as they refuse to lay down arms, they are subjected to the pains inflicted on innocent Nigerians,” he said.
