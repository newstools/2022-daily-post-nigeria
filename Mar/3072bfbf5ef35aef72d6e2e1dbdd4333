Shehu Sani, a former Kaduna Central Senator, on Tuesday, said bandits have become the fourth tier of government in Nigeria. Sani noted the series of attacks by bandits show that Nigerians need no additional proof that bandits have become the fourth tier of government. The socio-political activist was reacting to a comment by Governor Abubakar Sani Bello of Niger State that bandits occupied 12 of the 25 Local Government Areas in the state. Bello had disclosed this during his recent visit to the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) at the Central Primary School, Gwada. Reacting, Sani noted that Niger State is a neighbour to the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, yet bandits are occupying its local governments. In a tweet, the former lawmaker wrote: “The Governor of Niger revealed that terrorists occupy 12 of the 25 Local Governments in the state. “Niger is a state that neighbours the Federal Capital. What additional proof is needed that bandits have become the fourth tier of Government?”
