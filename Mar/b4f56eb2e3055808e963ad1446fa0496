Rangers legend, Ally McCoist, believes Manchester United should appoint former Real Madrid coach, Zinedine Zidane, as their next manager ahead of Paris Saint-Germain’s Mauricio Pochettino and Ajax’s Erik ten Hag. McCoist believes Zidane can help Man United win the Champions League in the near future if they appoint him to become their next manager. DAILY POST reports that Man United are currently searching for a new coach to take over from Ralf Rangnick at the end of the season. The likes of Pochettino and Ten Hag have been strongly linked with the Old Trafford hot seat. Speaking about the manager Man United should appoint, McCoist told TalkSPORT: “The one name I have not heard anything from is Zidane. Clearly, the one thing he can do and do on a regular basis is win the Champions League. He has proved that. He did it three times with Real Madrid.” McCoist added: “He can handle big players and big pressure and a big situation at a massive club, so I am not sure why he is not in the running at all. Unless he has ruled himself out?”
