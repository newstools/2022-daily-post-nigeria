Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti, has emerged the shock short-term option as Manchester United continue their pursuit for a new manager, ESPN reports. Ancelotti maintains a close personal relationship with Red Devils’ boss, Sir Alex Ferguson. New United CEO, Richard Arnold, is believed to have sought advice from Ferguson since taking over from Ed Woodward earlier this year. United want to make a long-term appointment ahead of next season and have drawn up a five-man shortlist which includes PSG’s Mauricio Pochettino and Erik ten Hag of Ajax. Ferguson is an admirer of Pochettino but has recommended that the Premier League club consider Ancelotti if the ex-Tottenham Hotspur manager rules himself out of the running. Ancelotti is seen as the type of coach who could be successful during a short spell, because of his vast experience in the Premier League and Champions League. He also has a track record of managing squads full of high-profile players. Ralf Rangnick, who was put in charge temporarily following Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s sack in November, has also said he could recommend to the board that he stays in the role for another year.
