The Police in Zamfara State have condemned the allegation of extortion leveled against some officers. State Task Force chairman, Abubakar Dauran, had told reporters that policemen were collecting money from people at filling stations. He further warned the security agency to desist from going to such locations because his committee has not invited them. A statement on Thursday by Mohammed Shehu, Zamfara Command spokesman, said no formal complaint has been made by residents or filling stations. The Public Relations Officer added that the Task Force boss never lodged a verbal or written complaint against officers. The Command described Dauran’s comments as “misleading and an attempt to discredit his former constituency (the Police) and Governor Bello Matawalle”, as they work to manage the fuel scarcity. Shehu dared him to “prove his allegations to enable the Commissioner of Police take decisive action against any of its personnel indicted. “Abubakar Dauran, like any other citizen, has a responsibility to observe and report any Police misconduct. “The Command assures the public that it will leave no stone unturned in taking appropriate action against any of its erring personnel”, the statement added.
