Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has revealed three key conversations with US President Joe Biden amid the ongoing war between his country and Russia. The war between Ukraine and Russia began last month. The war enters its twelfth day today, with massive casualties already recorded. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had ordered the invasion of Ukraine over disagreements on some political issues, had listed some conditions to end the war. However, Zelensky has now revealed that he had another conversation with President Biden on issues of security, financial support for Ukraine and the continuation of sanctions against Russia. “As part of the constant dialogue, I had another conversation with @POTUS,” Zelensky wrote on Twitter. “The agenda included the issues of security, financial support for Ukraine and the continuation of sanctions against Russia.” Zelensky also spoke with Israel’s Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, shortly after Bennett’s three-hour meeting with Vladimir Putin in Moscow.
