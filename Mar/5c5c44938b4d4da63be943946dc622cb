Ralf Rangnick has spoken on some managerial options to take over from him on permanent basis at Manchester United. The German says he has an opinion on who should be the next manager at Old Trafford, but maintained that those talks have not taken place with the United hierarchy yet. United are looking out for another permanent manager once more as they fight to secure a Champions League place next season. “So far, we’ve not spoken about that,” Rangnick told Sky Sports. “Not with John Murtough or anyone else, we’ve not spoken about this topic over the last weeks and months since I’ve been here. I know my opinion, but so far, we’ve not spoken about that, so it’s all I can tell you,” he said. Ajax boss, Erik ten Hag is one of the top managers that are favourites for the job at Old Trafford and his work at Ajax has won the admiration of Rangnick. “I don’t know him to start with as a person, but I’ve seen how Ajax have developed since he’s been there,” Rangnick added. “I know about the work he did while he was at Bayern Munich and it’s obvious he’s one of the top coaches in Europe but there are a few others. “We’ve not spoken about any new manager so far and, therefore, we’ve not spoken about him.”
