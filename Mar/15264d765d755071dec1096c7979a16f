Ex-Super Eagles star, Joseph Yobo has enjoined Nigerians to actively take part in the 2023 electoral process. The former captain stated that this would ensure the emergence of credible and capable leaders. Yobo, the BoT Chairman, Grassroot Mobilisation Initiative for Good Governance (GMI4GG), spoke in Abuja on Monday. He stressed the need to sensitise both young and old citizens to play their roles since voting is a right. Yobo said everyone wants a nation that works, rewards hard work, dignity, and where infrastructure works. “A nation where leaders elected are accountable to the people that elect them”, NAN quoted him saying. “Nigeria is work in progress. We have made some progress, but we want more. We are not where we should be. “It is against this background that I and some like minds have taken it upon ourselves to speak out.” Yobo added that 2023 elections are very crucial for the future of Nigeria. “We desire as a country where our God-given rights are met. This time, our votes will count, all citizens should get involved,” he urged.
