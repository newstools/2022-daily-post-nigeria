The Nigeria Police Force (NPF) has ordered the suspension of the Police Community Relations Committee (PCRC) chairperson, Edo State Command, Helen Atekha Odemwingie. A statement Wednesday night by Force Public Relations Officer (FPRO), Muyiwa Adejobi conveyed the sanction. The Force decried the illegal use of police uniforms, kits and accoutrement by non-police individuals and groups. The suspension followed a trending photo of the PCRC chairperson and other members dressed in police uniform. Adejobi noted that their outfits also had police insignias and various inscriptions. The spokesman said the act contravenes provisions of Section 214(1) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) and Section 101 of the Police Act, 2020. Quoting IGP Usman Baba, he warned that henceforth, any individual who adorns themselves illegally in police uniforms, would face the full wrath of the law. Baba further ordered the police disciplinary units – Force Provost Marshal, the IGP Xsquad and Monitoring Unit – to go to action. They were directed to clampdown on persons who engage in illegal sales of uniforms, kits and accoutrement, outside of police approved stores and the office of the Quartermaster. Additionally, the FPRO is to meet members of the Guild of Actors in Nigeria to improve partnership and ensure proper use of police uniforms, kits and accoutrement in their movies/skits.
