Manchester United star, Paul Pogba could be on his way to either Aston Villa or Newcastle in the summer, according to The Sun. The two Premier League clubs have entered the race, alongside the likes of Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus to sign the French star. Pogba is widely expected to leave the Premier League giants this summer and made it clear earlier this week that he has wasted the last five of his career at Old Trafford. Newcastle United and Aston Villa are interested to bring Pogba out of Old Trafford and have made contact with his representatives over a possible move. Newcastle are now one of the richest clubs in the world following their Saudi Arabia-backed takeover in November. They have also avoided relegation this season since Eddie Howe replaced Steve Bruce as manager. Villa, meanwhile, is another club ready to spend heavily and will be looking to have a better finish in the Premier League in the next few years.
