Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand has told the club two players to sign in the upcoming transfer window that will solve their midfield problem. Ferdinand wants Man United to sign West Ham United’s Declan Rice and Aston Villa’s John McGinn to solve the issues in their midfield. Midfield has been a problem area for Man United so far this season, with the likes of Fred and Scott McTominay often failing to impress the Old Trafford faithful. “Yeah, massively. I think you are getting two good characters. I think character is one of the main elements that we need – obviously, you look for a certain amount of class and quality in the players,” Ferdinand said on the Five YouTube channel. “I think some would say, “oh John McGinn, not a sexy enough signing”, but I think he is a very good player and by all accounts a very good lad, a great professional, not afraid to say what he wants to say to people to get the best out of them. “He would be good in that element and on the pitch, I think he would be good enough. Is he going to elevate us to being Champions League and Premier League winners? Probably not based on just ability, but I think character stands for a lot in this game,” he said. Ferdinand added, “Declan Rice, I have said enough about him. I love this player, I love this guy. If you are one of the top teams, you want to build a team around him.”
