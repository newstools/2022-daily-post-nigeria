A group, North East Business Forum has purchased the 2023 Presidential Nomination and Expression of Interest forms for former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar. Atiku is eyeing the presidential seat on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The group, which later presented the forms to Atiku at his Asokoro, Abuja residence on Thursday, said it’s in fulfillment of their December 2021 promise to purchase the forms for the former vice president as an expression of their support for his presidential bid. The PDP 2019 presidential candidate, while receiving the forms, expressed appreciation to the group for the kind gesture. Waziri Adamawa lamented that the challenges confronting the country are very enormous and require collective efforts to tackle them. He explained that “In 2018 or 2019, some young men contributed money and bought me the nomination form, the first in political history since the return of democracy to our country and truly they made me shed tears. They put together their hard-earned money and purchased me the form. I was emotional about it. “Today, like the chairman of the Northeast Business Forum said, we were invited and another gesture was extended to me. It was a promise. And today, it is a promise fulfilled. “The challenges before us as Nigerians are enormous and in fact, we have never faced these types of challenges in the history of our country.” He also observed that Nigeria’s unity is threatened, the economy is in the worst state of affairs, since the inception of this country and security is a disaster, these are very serious challenges, stating that “These are challenges that require the unity of everybody in this country.” He urged all Nigerians to unite themselves to tackle the very numerous challenges. Earlier in his remarks, media mogul, Chairman Emeritus of DAAR Communications, Raymond Dokpesi, described Atiku as the most qualified to lead Nigeria. He said the former Vice President is ready in his quest to salvage Nigeria.
