Aloy Ejimakor, Special Counsel to Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has reacted to the release of Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Igboho. Ejimakor said Igboho’s release was an indication that the Nigerian government and the court must reverse its injustice against Kanu. The Counsel said Igboho’s release had shown that self-determination was not a crime. He also noted that the release of the Yoruba Nation agitator indicated that self-determination was not an extraditable offense. In a tweet, Ejimakor wrote: “The release of Igboho by Benin Republic has validated the universal law that #SelfDetermination is neither a crime, nor an extraditable offense. “If it is, Igboho would’ve been extradited to Nigeria. “If Nigeria fails to reverse its injustice to #NnamdiKanu, its courts must.” The Beninese Government released Igboho yesterday. The Yoruba Nation agitator was arrested in Cotonou while attempting to travel to Germany in 2021. This was after he was declared wanted by the Department of State Services, DSS.
