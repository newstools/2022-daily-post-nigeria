A gubernatorial aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Oyo State, Engineer Olukayode Joshua Popoola, has urged governor Seyi Makinde of the state to explain why the state Accountant-General was arrested. Popoola made this disclosure on Thursday in Ibadan, the state capital. DAILY POST recalls that the state Accountant-General, Mr. Gafar Bello was recently arrested and detained for some days by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Popoola has, however, challenged Makinde to explain to the residents of the state why and how the accountant-general was arrested. He spoke during his official declaration to contest the next year’s gubernatorial election on the platform of the PDP. Popoola, who said the security situation in the state is worsening, described it as handmade. The PDP chieftain, while speaking further, challenged Makinde to give account of the borrowing of his government in the last two years. Popoola noted that the state deserved the best person to lead her in 2023. “Development of any nation largely depends on security of lives and property. Our party is known for peace and development but today, the reverse is the case in Oyo State. None of us is secured again. This is simply because we empowered troublemakers. “In as much as I agree that security in Nigeria is a national issue, but we all know that the magnitude of insecurity in the north is not applicable in the south but ours is handmade. “On economy, for how long can we continue to borrow money for payment of salaries? For how long can we empower strangers from Osun State to determine our fate in Oyo State? Our leaders are yet to tell us why the state accountant general was arrested and detained.”
