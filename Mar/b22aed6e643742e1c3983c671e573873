The Lagos State Police Command has commenced a probe into the comments of a female suspect, Chidinma Madukwe. The 32-year-old is a victim of ‘Crack Squad’, a gang that has been terrorizing Festac and Satellite Town in Amuwo Odofin Local Government Area. Madukwe who confessed her involvement in the sale of illicit drugs at Lumac said she had to stop following pressure from a robber leader called Hefty. Upon arrest, she recalled alerting the police of the threats on her life but that an officer went behind to inform the kingpin. “I once reported how he had been intimidating me to a policeman at Area E, Festac Town. But the policeman told Hefty that I wanted to bust his gang. “Hefty and his boys came to my house, beat me up and left me with injuries on my face. “Each time, they would beat me, my younger brother, and collect our valuables including phones”, Madukwe told Vanguard. On Monday, Police Public Relations Officer, Benjamin Hundeyin announced that CP Abiodun Alabi has ordered the “identification and arrest of the rogue police officer”. Alabi vowed that any operative “found undermining the tireless efforts of the Command to rid Lagos crime and criminality would be appropriately sanctioned”. The chief assured that the safety and security of all residents remain paramount to the security agency.
