Former Enyimba coach, Kadiri Ikhana, has said that qualifying for the 2022 World Cup is Nigeria’s birthright. Ikhana stated this during an interview with Brila FM. According to him, the Black Stars of Ghana don’t have the firepower to stop the Super Eagles. “The team is good enough to get the tickets and I don’t think the Ghanaians can stop them from qualifying for the World Cup. “We saw both teams at the Africa Cup of Nations, although that’s few months ago, but I still believe the Super Eagles will get the better of the Ghanaians. “The first leg is vital and they must give their best to ensure that they come home with good results. “The World Cup is Nigeria’s birth right and we can’t afford not to qualify,” Ikhana said. Ghana will host Nigeria on March 25 in Kumasi before the reverse fixture on March 29 at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja.
