Despite Governor Udom Emmanuel’s ban on scavenging in Akwa Ibom State, a suspected scavenger has allegedly murdered one Edikan in Eket Local Government Area of the state. It was gathered that the deceased was killed on Sunday morning at Marina Junction, Eket, after a mild disagreement with the scrap metal scavenger. The Chairman of Eket LGA, Mr Akaniyene Tommy, who had visited the family of the deceased condoled with the bereaved family, even as he reassured the people that the culprit has been arrested and would be prosecuted. He said, “The combined team of Police Force and Military Task Force (JTF) operating in Eket apprehended the culprit and he will surely surely face the full wrath of the law.” He explained that anyone seen engaging in scavenging, which the state government had earlier banned, would be duly arrested and handed over to the security agencies in the state. Speaking at the visit, the Youth Leader of the Hausa community in Eket, Alhaji Ibrahim Iliya condemned the murder of Edikan by his Hausa brothers. Iliya noted that Hausas are peace-loving people and having stayed for more than 31 years in Eket, he cannot support any form of violence in Eket Local Government by any of their subjects. He called on the law enforcement agencies to take its full course on the arrested culprit. Reacting to the incident, the Akwa Ibom Police Public Relations Officer, SP Odiko Macdon, confirmed the incident, saying that the culprit is in detention in Eket Police Station.
