The Resident Electoral Commissioner for Rivers State, Obo Effanga has clarified that only the 18 registered political parties will take part in the forthcoming 2023 general election. Speaking during a media parley in Port Harcourt, the state capital, on Thursday, Effanga said the commission only recognizes 18 registered political parties. He further explained that even if more political parties get registered now, they would not be able to field candidates in the 2023 elections as the newly signed electoral act prescribes that political parties must be registered one year before the election. He said, “We have only 18 political parties this time. Going into the election we are not going to have more political parties than 18. “Even if new political parties are to be registered today they cannot participate in the 2023 general elections because by the provisions of the new electoral act, a political party will have to be in existence for at least one year before it can participate in general elections.” He encouraged the political parties to conduct their affairs including the congresses and convention as well as their primaries on time.
