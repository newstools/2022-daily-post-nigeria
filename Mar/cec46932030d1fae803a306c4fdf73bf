Chelsea star, Mason Mount, has admitted that he is struggling to focus on his performances after the Blues owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government. The UK government had on Thursday sanctioned Abramovich and some other Russian oligarchs as part of its response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions are intended to stop Abramovich, who is said to be close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, from making money from Chelsea. Reacting to the sanctions imposed on Abramovich, Mount admitted that the situation has ‘not been easy’ for the players at Stamford Bridge. “It’s not been easy, of course,” Mount said at his post-match press conference after Chelsea’s Premier League 3-1 win over Norwich City at Carrow Road on Thursday. “We see what is happening behind the scenes and everything that is going on, it can be hard to focus. “But I think we have been brilliant, especially today. With everything that is happening off the pitch, for us to stay focused and stay on the ball to win this game, I thought we were brilliant. “We just need to focus on what we can do on the pitch, that is our only goal.”
