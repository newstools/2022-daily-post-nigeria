UEFA have said that Chelsea will not be able to sell tickets for any future Champions League matches at Stamford Bridge, as long as Roman Abramovich is still owner of the club. This follows the sanctions imposed on Abramovich by the European Union (EU). The Blues will have to play any future home European games behind closed doors. Chelsea are away to Lille in the round of 16 second leg on Wednesday night, boasting a 2-0 advantage from the first leg. If Thomas Tuchel’s men make it into the quarter-final, then whichever leg is at home will be played in front of no supporters. A UEFA statement on Tuesday read: “UEFA is fully committed to always implementing relevant EU and international sanctions. Our understanding is that the present case is assessed in the context of the licence issued in the UK which allows Chelsea FC to continue minimum football activity whilst providing a safeguard that no financial gain will result for Mr Abramovich. “We will work with the EU and relevant member states to ensure we have full clarity and remain in lockstep with all relevant and applicable measures in line with latest developments.”
