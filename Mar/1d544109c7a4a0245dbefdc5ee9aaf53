The Deputy Chief Whip of the Ogun State House of Assembly, Hon. Olusola Adams, has cried out over the invasion of villages and farmlands by elephants at Itashin, Ijebu East Local Government Area of the state. Adams lamented that the elephants have injured a farmer, who he said is currently receiving treatment at Ijebu Ode General Hospital, Ogun State. Speaking under personal explanation during plenary in Abeokuta on Thursday, the lawmaker explained that the elephants attacked villagers in his constituency, describing the situation as worrisome. He called on relevant government agencies to take necessary actions towards returning the elephants to their game reserves. Responding, the Speaker of the Assembly, Olakunle Oluomo, condemned the invasion of elephants into villages and farmlands. Oluomo advised farmers to stop further encroachment on the natural habitat of elephants, a development he said made the animals leave their habitat to attack people. According to him, the issue of elephants’ incursion into towns which occurred at Itasin in Ijebu East, required the state Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry to engage the Nigerian Conservative Foundation. ”This is towards preserving the species and the entire ecosystem,” he said.
