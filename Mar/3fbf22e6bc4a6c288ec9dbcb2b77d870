The Senate Chief Whip, Orji Uzor Kalu has urged the Federal Government to sack the management of the Nigerian Football Federation, NFF. Kalu said the current NFF management should be sacked and replaced with a more tactical and better one for failing to give Nigeria the needed result. He made the call in reacting to the Super Eagles 1-1 draw with the black Stars of Ghana. The Black Stars of Ghana qualified for the 2022 World cup in Qatar after the draw in Abuja. The first leg in Ghana had ended goalless. Reacting, Kalu in a Facebook post wrote: “What a sad night for all soccer lovers! It is high time the entire Management of the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) is overhauled. “In the past five years, we have exercised patience with incompetence that should ordinarily be the best, not just in Africa, but the world. “The reality is that football is the same with science courses like Medicine and Engineering where you can’t cut corners, otherwise, you produce quack and incompetent people. “The Federal Government and Nigerians have supported the NFF beyond measures and since they can’t give us the needed result, they should be sacked for a better and more tactical management.”
