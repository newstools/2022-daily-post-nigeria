The National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress, Sen. John Akpanudoedehe has said he won’t resign his position until Buhari says so. He said he cannot just resign because some people said the President said so. Akpanudoedehe stated this on Tuesday in Abuja while addressing journalists after the story of his resignation broke. He insisted that he remained the national secretary of the party.
