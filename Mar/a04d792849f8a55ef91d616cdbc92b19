Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick has named some of the players he considers as “engines” in the squad. According to Rangnick, they are players who must take responsibility, like Cristiano Ronaldo did against Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday. Ronaldo netted a stunning hat-trick as United saw off Antonio Conte’s men 3-2 at Old Trafford. But Rangnick insisted the 37-year-old is not the only core member of his squad. “Cristiano is an important player, of course. With his reputation and with the way he can still play, he has influence on the team, for sure. “But there are also other players in the team who have to take responsibility, who have to perform, who can be leaders of the team. “He can be a leader with a performance like today. This is what I’ve been telling him since I arrived, that with a performance like today he can be one of the engines of the team. “But we have quite a few other players who can do the same, including Fred, Harry Maguire, Raphael Varane, Victor Lindelof, whoever. “Even Edi [Edinson Cavani], when he came on the last 10 or 15 minutes, showed how important and what kind of role he can still play for the team,” Rangnick said.
