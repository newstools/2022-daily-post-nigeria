Human rights activist, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa has asked the Lagos State Government to arrest the masterminds of the murder of BRT passenger, Bamise Ayanwola. In a statement on Tuesday, the Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) also demanded that N500 million be paid as compensation to the family. Adegboruwa, however, hailed state authorities for fulfilling the promise to prosecute Andrew Ominnikoron. The driver was arraigned before the High Court of Lagos State on criminal charges of rape and murder. He has been remanded in prison. Adegboruwa commended Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and Attorney-General Moyosore Onigbanjo for the speed with which they have handled the matter. He noted that the quality of legal representation, through the Director of Public Prosecution, Babajide Martins, “is a testimony of the commitment of the government to do justice to the case”. “In the light of the evidence available that the facility (bus) and employee (driver) of the government were deployed to commit the crime, it is necessary for the Lagos State Government to reach out to the family of the deceased. “First to offer an apology and give healing to the grieving parents and siblings and then secondly, to offer adequate compensation (not less than N100,000,000) to the family. Without this, there will continue to be a missing gap.” The lawyer reminded Sanwo-Olu to fulfil his promise to equip all public transport buses with facilities that will enhance passengers’ security. Adegboruwa commended Nigerians who have kept on the pressure for justice, “especially the civil society organizations and the media”.
