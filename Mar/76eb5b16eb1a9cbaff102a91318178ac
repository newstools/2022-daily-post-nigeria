The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has warned the UK government to make sure that Chelsea is not sold off as part of a “fire sale”. Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich has been sanctioned over his links to Russian President Vladimir Putin as the UK government targeted more oligarchs after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Recall that Abramovich, who has been branded a pro-Kremlin oligarch, was hit with an asset freeze and travel ban on Thursday. Khan urged the Government to distinguish Chelsea and what is happening in Ukraine. Speaking with PA news agency, Khan said: “I think Chelsea are a great Premier League club, they are the champions of Europe, the world club champions. “They were a great club before the current owner and they will be a great club after the current owner. “It is important to distinguish Chelsea and what is happening in Ukraine because the reality is for too long Russian oligarchs close to Putin had been using homes in London, businesses in London, to launder money. “I think it is right that the Government is now taking sanctions and seizing assets of those Russian oligarchs close to Putin.” He added: “The Government will do what it can to support Chelsea in relation to future fixtures, in relation to continuing to be a viable club in the Premier League. “What is also important though is we don’t allow a situation where any asset which may be owned by a Russian oligarch close to Putin is sold off in a fire sale.”
