President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed pleasure over the increase in membership of the All Progressives Congress, APC, saying the APC has recorded 41 million members. Speaking at the party’s national convention yesterday in Abuja, Buhari said the record now puts APC as the largest political party in Nigeria. He noted that the numerical strength puts APC at a level where it can win elections fairly. According to Buhari: “I am impressed to learn that the membership registration and revalidation exercise undertaken by the Caretaker Committee has recorded over 41 million members. ”This has proved that we are indeed Nigeria’s leading and largest political party. ”It also exhibits our numerical strength and the potential to win elections at all given times fairly and squarely.”
