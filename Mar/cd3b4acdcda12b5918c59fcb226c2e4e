A socio-political activist, Reno Omokri, says former President, Goodluck Jonathan overfed Nigerians during his administration by making food items affordable. In a post on his verified Facebook page, the former presidential aide lamented how Nigerians attacked his former boss despite alleviating poverty in his tenure. Reacting to the current economic crisis bedeviling the nation, Omokri alleged that President Muhammadu Buhari’s regime has used starvation to cure Nigerians of ingratitude. Flashing back to how his critics buried Jonathan in a mock coffin prior to 2015 presidential elections, Omokri explained that such attacks would not have been possible if Nigerians were starved like the current situation. He said, “I am just laughing when Nigerians say there is hunger in the land, and that even eggs are now beyond the reach of minimum wage workers. Former President Jonathan made food available to Nigerians. “The Food and Agricultural Organisation of the UN gave Nigeria an award for reducing poverty under Jonathan. A bag of rice that now costs ₦42k only cost ₦8k under Jonathan. One egg now costs ₦80, as opposed to ₦20 under GEJ. But how did we reward him? Overfeeding gave us energy to fight Jonathan. We did #OccupyNaija. “We buried Jonathan in a mock coffin. And his mother, who had to bury all but two of her children, wept profusely in Aso Rock at the trauma of that sight. Today, General Buhari has used mass starvation to cure us off our ingratitude”!
