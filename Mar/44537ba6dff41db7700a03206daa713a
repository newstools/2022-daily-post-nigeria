The House of Representatives is investigating duplication of duties and overlapping of functions by federal government agencies. Rep. Mohammed Monguno (APC – Borno) moved the motion during plenary on Wednesday. He said though Section 153(1) of the Constitution established Federal Executive Bodies, Section 4(2) of empowered the National Assembly to repeal obsolete laws. Monguno noted that the law also empowers the legislature to enact new ones for good governance. Nigeria has been gaining on the world index of Ease of Doing Business (EDB), moving from 145th position in 2019 to 131st in 2020, he highlighted. Monguno said the improvement must be consolidated and demanded that existing 1,484 agencies be looked into. He lamented their similar functions and clash of interests, citing the concerns by the World Bank in its annual ratings. After his presentation, the House resolved to ascertain the root cause of bickering among some departments, agencies and boards. The Green Chamber also agreed to establish mergers of agencies that might have outlived their usefulness in the digital age.
