As the 2023 general elections draw nearer, the 2019 presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, will today (Tuesday) meet with the party’s caucus in the House of Representatives. DAILY POST gathered that the meeting is expected to take place somewhere in Wuse, Abuja. All members are expected to attend the crucial meeting slated for 7 pm. A credible source close to the former Vice President who does not want his name mentioned said “obviously the meeting is about 2023”. “Since the signing of the amended electoral act by President Muhammadu Buhari, those who want to succeed him, including Atiku have stepped up their consultation”, the source noted. He continued, “Atiku will formally declare soon, but before he will declare he needs to meet with as many as possible critical stakeholders and delegates. “So the Waziri Adamawa will use this meeting as an avenue to inform the PDP House of Representatives members of his 2023 ambition. He will solicit their support and discuss other party and national issues”.
