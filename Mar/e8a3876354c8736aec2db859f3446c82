Ahead of the National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC), slated for Saturday, critical stakeholders of the party in Bauchi State have cried out over their outright exclusion in the power sharing arrangement in the party. They rejected the decision of a section of the stakeholders of the party from the North-East geo-political zone to micro zone the seat of the Deputy National Chairman of the party to Borno State. The APC chieftains, who rose from an emergency meeting held in Abuja, said they were not part of the decision to cede the seat of the Deputy National Chairman to Borno State. The aggrieved APC stalwarts argued that there was no way Borno State would be placed far ahead Bauchi State renowned as the traditional base of the APC in the North- East part of the country in both the 2015 and the 2019 general election. The party chieftains argued that Borno State boasts more than enough of government patronage under President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration than Bauchi State that had carved a niche as a traditional base of the APC after Kano State since the 2015 general election. The Bauchi chieftains cited the national security adviser, Gen Ali Mohammed Mongonu, the group managing Director Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (GMD), Mele Kyari, the Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba Alkali, and the Managing-Director, North East Development Commission, Mohammed Goni Alkali Borno and Yobe State also produced the National Secretary and later APC caretaker chairman, over the past two years, among others. They thereby enjoined the APC leadership to have a rethink and treat Bauchi State in a fair and just manner. According to the stakeholders, comprising former governors of the State, former deputy Governors of the State, three serving Senators, former Speaker of the House of Representatives and eight of his colleagues in the Green Chamber and 17 House of Assembly members: “There is the need to reinforce APC’s position in Bauchi State to enable the party to reclaim the State. “Bauchi State has the highest votes in the North-east after Kano State and has consistently delivered the highest votes to the APC after Kano State, and this should not be toyed with.”
