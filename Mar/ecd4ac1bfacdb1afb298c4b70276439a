Super Eagles forward, Ahmed Musa, has urged his teammates to give all their best when they face the Black Stars of Ghana in the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifier first-leg tie on Friday in Kumasi. Musa wants the Super Eagles to get a good result against Otto Addo’s side in Ghana before the second leg in Nigeria. The former Leicester City star stated this on Tuesday ahead of the Ghana clash. “We have to give all what we have in the first game to see what we can have before we come back home,” Musa was quoted by Super Eagles’ official Instagram account as saying. “And by the grace of God, we will do all our best to see what we can do over there.” Meanwhile, Nigeria will host Ghana in the return leg four days later after Friday’s match.
