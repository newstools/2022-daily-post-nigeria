A former federal lawmaker, Shehu Sani has reacted to President Muhammadu Buhari’s claim that the membership of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has risen to 41 million members. Buhari made the claim at the party’s national convention in Abuja, saying the number now puts the ruling party as the largest political party in Nigeria. He noted that the numerical strength puts APC at a level where it can win elections fairly. Buhari said he was impressed to learn that the membership registration and revalidation exercise of the party recorded such members. In reaction, Sani, who did not doubt the President’s claim, however, noted that Nigerian citizens in the ruling party are now almost the population of Ukraine and more than Canada. “With a claim of 41 million registered members,Nigeria’s ruling party now almost matched up the population of Ukraine Or more than the population of Canada,” Shehu Sani, who represented Kaduna Central Senatorial District in the eighth assembly, tweeted.
