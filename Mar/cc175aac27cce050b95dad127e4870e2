The leadership of the Taraba State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has denied allegations making the round that the party has anointed a candidate for the number one position of the state ahead of the 2023 general elections. Debunking the rumours on Wednesday in Jalingo, during a stakeholders meeting, the state chairman, Col. Kefas Agbu (rtd), said the party has “no anointed candidate” adding that “everybody is free to contest and win the election.” Stressing the party’s readiness to provide a level playing ground for all the aspirants, the transformational agenda of the party for the state, he said is aimed at accommodating the people’s choice for leadership selection. He said the desire for a credible and transparent leader that will transform the state will be truncated if the people are overruled and a candidate imposed during the process. He added that the party will ensure the emergence of a credible candidate. “The party’s desire is not just to win but also ensure the desired quality leadership delivery for the state,” said Kefas. The party chairman who also went ahead to dispel the rumours making the round that the party is at the verge of being expunged from the state due to internal skirmishes, said “We have no crack in PDP, we have been winning and we are set again to win again.” Speaking through his deputy, Engineer Haruna Manu, the state governor, Arc. Darius Dickson Ishaku, urged party members to be committed in order to emerge victorious in the forthcoming polls. He said, “Do not allow the opposition to takeover the state. Taraba has been PDP since 1999, and is required of you to ensure that PDP clear all the positions and maintain it existence in the state.”
