The leadership of the Unified Nigerian Youth Forum (UNYF) has noted that Monday’s attack on the Kaduna-Abuja train by terrorists has further exposed the inability of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration to keep to its campaign promises with the increased spate of insecurity and other challenges bedevilling the country. The forum, therefore, condemned in strong terms the tragic attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train leading to the loss of lives, injuries and abduction of many. Comrade Abdulsalam Moh’d Kazeem, the president of the forum in a statement said, “The series of attacks has further exposed the inability of the current administration to keep to her campaign promises, the spate of insecurity in our nation is terrible and we lack appropriate words to describe it.” “It’s no news again that the current administration has failed us, but we the citizens should not allow this to consume us and the leadership, because available information at our disposal shows the nation has recently imported super Tucanos and many helicopter fighting jets, but to our greatest surprise the said Tucanos and fighter jets are nowhere to be found, rather some of them are diverted to be used against citizens during a peaceful and lawful protest against bad governance, to us indeed it’s a misplaced priority and wrong placement.” It noted that it is not surprised at the current happenings in the country, after over six years of the current administration, the government is still blaming the past government over everything, saying that this alone has further proven that nothing good can be achieved by President Mohammed Buhari and his co-travellers. According to the statement, the present administration rather would continue to feed Nigerians with their usual propaganda and conspiracy theories of blaming others for their shortcomings. It urged the Federal Government to immediately declare a state of emergency on security, stressing that the government should secure the release of all those kidnapped without asking their relatives to pay the ransom. It also urged the government to pay all the medical bills of all those that sustain injuries and are currently in the hospital and equally compensate them for loss of valuables.
