Peoples Democratic Party, PDP governorship aspirant in Benue State, Mr. Terver Akase, has urged his supporters across the state to remain calm and wait for the outcome of the review of the Konshisha guber selection process being carried out by the leadership of the party at the State level. Akase also dismissed reports alleging that he has urged his supporters to ignore the pruning process, “insisting that he is the next governor and nothing will stop him from purchasing his nomination form.” This was contained in a statement issued by his campaign Media Director, Director, Media, on Tuesday. Akase also expressed confidence in the capacity of Benue Governor, Samuel Ortom and other leaders of the PDP to dispassionately look into concerns he and others have raised regarding the process of aspirants’ selection in Konshisha. The statement read in part: “We read a report on social media which claimed that frontline PDP governorship aspirant, Terver Akase, is among aspirants who have kicked against the decision of the leadership of the party in the State led by His Excellency, Governor Samuel Ortom to prune the number of those vying for the Benue top job in 2023. “For the avoidance of doubt, Terver Akase wholeheartedly accepted and has since subjected himself to the trimming exercise of PDP in Benue State. Akase has, however, appealed to the leadership of the party to review the pruning exercise, which result was announced by G-14 on Sunday 27th March 2022, contradicting the well-known fact that he is the first choice of Konshisha stakeholders. “No amount of distractions, blackmail, or smear campaigns can drag Akase into an unnecessary media war with anyone, as he is focused on his 2023 bid.” Akase also expressed confidence that the PDP in Benue State will remain united and go on to win the 2023 elections.
