An ally of former Senate President Bukola Saraki, Musa Yeketi, has defected from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to the All Progressives Congress, APC. Yeketi dumped PDP for APC, alongside 14 political groups yesterday in Ilorin, Kwara State. Speaking at his daughter’s wedding ceremony, the former Commissioner for Education in the State, cited Saraki’s leadership style as the reason for his defection. Yeketi, a political mentee of Saraki’s father, Olusola, said: “Dr. Olusola Saraki did not only mentor us into political maturity, he also led and interacted with many of us who were either his lieutenants or foot soldiers like his children. “The approach of the scion of this dynasty is greatly different from Baba’s, and this has a great effect on the structure the late Olusola Saraki left behind. This approach eventually punched the dynasty in the face, bringing it to total collapse in 2019. “A wise visitor must take his leave when his host presents him bad yam as supper. “I am old and politically experienced enough to know when to quit a relationship or association, especially when the relationship turns one-sided.” He noted that the State governor, AbdulRaman AbdulRazaq welcomed him and his supporters into the APC. Yeketi said he and his followers would work towards moving the State forward. “We have got no other State to call ours. It’s imperative on us to support anyone willing to move the State forward in the interest of our children yet unborn, for posterity shall judge us if we do otherwise,” he said. The State’s Deputy Governor, Kayode Alabi, welcomed the defectors to the APC fold.
