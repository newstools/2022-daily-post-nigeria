Lionel Messi has no plans to leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the season, according to L’Equipe. The Argentina captain has been the target of fans’ outrage following their Champions League exit in the hands of Real Madrid. PSG supporters jeered Messi and team-mate Neymar during their league game against Bordeaux last Sunday. They further expressed their frustration by painting graffiti on the walls of the club’s Camps des Loges training ground, demanding changes and the departure of President Nasser Al-Khelaifi. However, Messi is determined to make a success of his move to France. He is determined to lift the Ligue 1 trophy and still dreams of winning the Champions League with PSG . While there are rumors of a possible return to Barcelona, there has been no contact between him or his entourage with the LaLiga club since he left them last summer. Messi intends to fulfill the two-year deal he signed with PSG last year when he joined from Barca. Personally, Messi understands the anger of the fans and shares their feelings of disappointment after a performance against Real Madrid, where PSG dominated their opponents, beating them for 75 per cent of the two-legged draw.
