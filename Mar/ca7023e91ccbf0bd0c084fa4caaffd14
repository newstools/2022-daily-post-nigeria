The Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU) youth wing, has condemned in very strong terms the killings of about 30 people in Agban, Kagoro, Kaura Local Government Area of Kaduna State by suspected Fulani militia. The youths, therefore, called on the people of Southern Kaduna to rise and defend themselves against those that come to kill and destroy their belongings. DAILY POST reported that on Sunday night, a group of suspected Fulani militia, in their large numbers, invaded Agban, Kagoro and killed about 30 people, injured others and destroyed their properties. In a statement issued by its National Youth leader, Isaac John Sirjay, the youths lamented that Maraban Agban Kagoro came under attack, with scores killed, properties and houses burnt, regretting that it was one of the uncountable number of attacks launched against the Southern Kaduna people. According to the statement, “it is worrisome the manner with which the criminals have continued to operate with no deliberate attempt by security bodies to intervene or stop the suspected Fulani terrorists from attacking our communities.” They explained that the government, both at the State and the Federal levels have failed to put an end to the mindless attacks on their people and arrest the perpetrators. The youths urged all not to sit and watch while their kinsmen were led to the slaughter like lambs, their lands taken, their children butchered and their sisters and daughters raped to death. The youths noted that every inch of land in Southern Kaduna is an inheritance from their forefathers and remains the exclusive entitlement of their offsprings. They vowed that they cannot abandon or cede an inch of Southern Kaduna to anyone at this time, not when their forefathers and fathers died protecting it. The youths said, “For the LORD our God is He that goeth with us, to fight for us against our enemies, to save us. Above all, brethren, let’s continue to look up to the heavens from where our help comes.”
