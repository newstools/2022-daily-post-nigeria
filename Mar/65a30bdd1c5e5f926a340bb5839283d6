Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State says he is hopeful of the possibility of a woman emerging as the Executive Governor of the state considering their numerical strength. Fielding questions from journalists in Kaduna on Tuesday, he said there was a ‘50 percent’ chance of a woman emerging the next governor because women accounted for half the population of the state. The governor, whose deputy is a female, Dr Hadiza Balarabe, said the state government would continue to give equal opportunity to women, noting that it had key women commissioners. He said, “You cannot ignore half of your population; it’s like clapping with one hand; 50 percent of our women and young people make up the state. “We always feel that giving women the same opportunities will make them perform well, even better than men. “We have tried to identify competent women and give them an opportunity to show they can do better, and they have not failed us; they are giving us their contributions in Kaduna State. “We think the rest of the country should take note and give more women and young people the opportunity because that is what will move the country forward. “I might have my preferences but my wish always is for the people of Kaduna to join me in praying that we get a successor who will take the state to the next level”.
