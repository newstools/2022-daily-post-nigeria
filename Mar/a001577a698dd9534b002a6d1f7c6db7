Liverpool are now only three points behind Premier League leaders Manchester City. This follows their nervy 1-0 win over West Ham at Anfield on Saturday. Sadio Mane scored the only goal of the game in the first half, tapping home Trent Alexander-Arnold’s low cross. The hosts were forced to hold on for all three points, as the Hammers squandered chances to equalize. The win takes Jurgen Klopp’s men up to 63 points, while City have 66 points. Both have played the same number of matches. However, the champions welcome Manchester United to The Etihad on Sunday.
