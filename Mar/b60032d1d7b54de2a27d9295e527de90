The Acting Commissioner of Police Kaduna State Command, DCP Maiyaki Mohammed Baba says a full-scale investigation into events that led to the suspected Fulani attack on Agban Kagoro in Kaduna has been ordered. Baba explained that the Police anti-riot units, conventional Police, as well as undercover operatives, have been deployed to the area to ensure the strict enforcement of the curfew imposed on Jema’a and Kaura LGAs by the state government. A statement issued by the Command’s Spokesman, ASP Mohammed Jalige also explained that the deployment of security personnel is to equally tame the spread of the crises to the neighbouring communities. The Acting CP said the deployment became necessary considering the volatile nature of such clashes in the past and attendant consequences. He said, “The measures taken will indeed give the authorities the ample chance to prevent any further loss of life and destruction of property of law-abiding citizens of the State.” While condoling the people of the state, particularly families of those who lost their loved ones in the unfortunate incident, Baba warned those inclined to such troublemaking to desist as the long hand of the law will always catch up with them. He called on the communities to be law-abiding and comply with the curfew imposed by the authority, warning that violators of the order will be made to face the consequences of their actions. He noted that the curfew is not in any way meant to punish anybody but a strategy to safeguard the sanctity of human life. He assured the parties that justice would be served on whosoever has a hand in the crisis, saying that the Command will not leave any stone unturned in getting to the root of the crisis.
