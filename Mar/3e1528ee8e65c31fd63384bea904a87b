The National Union of Electricity Generation and Transmission Employees (NUEGTE), has called on the federal government to deploy military and other security personnel within the Shiroro hydroelectric power station to retrain terrorists from attacking electrical facilities. The NUEGTE Zonal Organizing Secretary (North), Comrade Eyurentosanren Emmanuel Godwin, stated this while speaking with journalists in Zumba (IDP) camp, Shiroro.Local Government of Niger State. He explained that due to the increasing attacks on communities around the hydro dam, lives of its members and the facilities were in danger. According to him, “The presence of IDPs at the school that is close to the station is a security threat to both the workers and the hydro facilities. “The government should deploy more fully armed military personnel, land mine detectors and armoured vehicles to the area, because bandits have killed many people and we don’t want our staff killed,” Godwin stated. When contacted, the Director General of the state Emergency Management Agency, Ahmad Inga, explained that he was yet to officially receive information concerning the new IDPs camp in Shiroro area. The Shiroro Hydroelectric Power Dam was commissioned on June 20, 1990 by the then Military President, Ibrahim Babangida, and had a total installed capacity of 600 Megawatts. It was franchised by the federal government during the government privatization exercise on November 1, 2013 and now operated by the North South Power Company Limited (NSPCL).
