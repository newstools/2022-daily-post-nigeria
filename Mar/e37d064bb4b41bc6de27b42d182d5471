The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has cancelled celebrations for his 70th birthday on Tuesday. Tinubu took the decision following the attack on a train that was travelling on the Kaduna-Abuja rail line on Monday night. Jubril Gawat, a media aide to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, confirmed that guests were already seated at the venue of the event at Eko Hotel and Suites when the announcement was made. “FLASH: Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu announces the cancellation of his 70th Birthday Celebration on the Stage at Eko Hotel and Suites where guests and well-wishers were already seated for the event … Asiwaju says it calls for sober reflection and not celebration. “Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu announced officially that the birthday event has been officially cancelled and everyone should go home …. Asiwaju prays that May the souls of the departed Rest In Peace,” Gawat tweeted.
