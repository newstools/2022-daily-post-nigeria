Russia has said China refused to support them with the supply of aircraft parts, CNN reports Russia said China rejected requests to support them with aircraft parts as Moscow looks to source components following tough aviation sanctions from the U.S and other Western countries. Russian Head of the Aircraft Airworthiness Department, at the Federal Air Transport Agency, Valery Kudinov, said there were around 70 aircraft in the Russian register before the end of February. According to him, the situation with the maintenance of aircraft and imports of spare parts is planned to be resolved, including through the re-export of components. Kudinov added, “As far as I know … China refused,” adding that Russia would continue searching through other countries such as Turkey or India. “Each company will negotiate on its own,” Kudinov said. It is no longer news that the world’s two biggest aircraft manufacturers, Boeing and Airbus, have both suspended supply of components to Russian airlines over the invasion of Ukraine.
