The Federated Correspondents’ Chapel (FCC) of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ in Bayelsa State has urged security agencies in Bayelsa and Delta States to collaborate and ensure the release of Julius Osahon and all others abducted from a bus in the state. The call is contained in a statement signed by Christian Eze, Bassey Willie, Chairman and Secretary of the union respectively. The NUJ asked the Federal and State governments to ensure that there is adequate security on the highways especially, the Bayelsa and Delta axis of the East-West road. DAILY POST had earlier reported the abduction of the Journalists and the others including the driver of Sunny Eru Motors by gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen on Monday. Mr Julius Osahon, Bayelsa State Correspondent of the Guardian newspaper alongside others was abducted by unknown gunmen suspected to be kidnappers along Evwreni Community near Ugheli axis of Delta State while on transit to Warri. The NUJ said, “Security situation in our nation is becoming worrisome on daily basis, innocent citizens are being killed, kidnapped and their valuables carted away by criminals, that is why we call on the government to discharge its responsibility of protecting citizens’ lives and property optimally. “Journalists are not wealthy men in the society but just doing their duties to contribute to the growth and development of the nation, that is why we wonder where Mr Osahon will get N5 million demanded by the kidnappers to regain his freedom. “We pray the Almighty God to protect his young family and give them the courage to manage the trauma and free him unhurt to reunite with his family.”
