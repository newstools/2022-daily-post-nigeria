Former Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Women Leader in Kachia Local Government Area of Kaduna State, Mrs. Rhoda Musa Aliyah on Thursday has flayed the National Assembly for refusing to pass the gender bills. In a chat with DAILY POST in Kaduna, Mrs. Aliya expressed worry that the lawmakers did not even consider that women constitute 49 percent of the country’s estimated population. She said the neglect of women by the nation’s parliament is an embarrassment to the womenfolk, noting that, through women, the lawmakers were born, as such, they should have considered them as mothers. Ayila, a lecturer at the Department of Political Science, Bayero University Kano warned that the neglect by those respected as husbands and lawmakers have denied women their rightful position. She begged the leadership of the National Assembly to reconsider the bills and pass them without delay. She said, “as a woman who is passionate about the improvement of people and society, I call on the leadership of the National Assembly to rally members to ensure the total elimination of all forms of violence,” she said She condemned the action of members of the red chamber, adding, ”It is painful that 61 years after independence, Nigerian women and girls still grapple with gross violation of human rights, poverty, lack of inclusion, and varying forms of discrimination, which are clear indices of violence. ”The constitution guarantees freedom from all forms of discrimination, while the universal declaration of human rights guarantees the right to equality, freedom from torture and degrading treatment, right to recognition as a person before the law, right to equality before the law, and right to remedy by a competent tribunal, amongst others,” she said.
