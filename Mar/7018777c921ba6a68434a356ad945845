Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has hit back at his Edo State counterpart, Godwin Obaseki, describing him as a serial betrayer and an ingrate. Addressing a crowd in Rivers State on Monday, Wike said Obaseki has refused to be grateful to the PDP and the people who backed him to be re-elected when he was kicked out of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2019. For this reason, Wike went further to tender an apology to a former National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole, saying the former Edo State Governor had initially warned them about bringing Obaseki into the PDP fold. “If you check the DNA of Obaseki, what you will see in that DNA is betrayal, serial betrayal, and ungratefulness,” he said while addressing a crowd at the commissioning of a secondary school in Omuanwa community, Rivers State. “Let me stand today to apologise to Adams Oshiomhole who has been vindicated by telling us that we will see the true colour, the insincerity, the ungratefulness of Governor Obaseki. “We have voted for PDP since 1999 till now; ask Governor Obaseki if he has done anything for PDP (or) voted for PDP. The only election he voted was his own election – where we gave him an umbrella.” Recall that Obaseki had earlier lambasted Governor Wike after the Rivers State attacked his Deputy, Phillip Shaibu for demanding that they dump the PDP, where, according to him, they have not been accepted for two years now after decamping from the APC.
