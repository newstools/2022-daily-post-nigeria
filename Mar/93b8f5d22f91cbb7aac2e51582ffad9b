The Yobe State Council of Traditional Rulers has tasked the North-East Development Commission (NEDC) to complement the effort of the state government by executing life touching projects in rural areas of the state. The Council’s Chairman and the Emir of Fika, Alhaji Muhammadu Ibn Abali Muhammadu Idrissa, made the case at a high-level state engagement with stakeholders on the proposed master plan for the region organized by the commission in Damaturu. The monarch, who commended the federal government for establishing the commission to intervene in states affected by Boko Haram insurgency and other humanitarian crises, solicited for timely and adequate supply of fertilizers and other agriculture inputs to farmers to boost food security in the state. “The commission can also intervene to reduce the menace of youth unemployment through establishment of more skills acquisition centers and graduate them with starter packs. “Most of these rural areas of Yobe state, particularly the eastern parts of Fika, Gujba and Gulani areas are faced with acute water supply due to large deposits of limestone and gypsum, special rig should be deployed to drill boreholes in the areas for proper hygiene and disease prevention,” the Emir appealed. The Royal Father also urged the intervention agency to consider provision of rural roads to link with urban centres to enable farmers to easily transport their farm produce to markets.
