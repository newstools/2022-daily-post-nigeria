A stalwart of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Oyo State, Alhaji Adebisi Olopooeyan has dumped the party. Olopooeyan made the announcement on Wednesday. DAILY POST reports that Olopooeyan is from Ibadan North-East Local Government Area. In a resignation letter forwarded to the National Chairman of the party, he explained that the party had been in crisis for some time. He said that all efforts made to resolve the crisis had proved abortive. Olopooeyan added that reconciliation committees set up to resolve the crisis failed. He maintained that several committees headed by Dr. Saka Balogun, former Governor of Osun State, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola, Chief Bode George and Dr. Bukola Saraki failed to resolve the crisis. Olopooeyan added that it was God that saved his life in Osogbo during the zonal congress of the party. He alleged that thugs hijacked the zonal congress in Oyo State, adding that the thugs also disrupted the State congress of the party, during which about 200 vehicles were vandalized, while several people were injured. Olopooeyan insisted that for these reasons, he had dumped the PDP. He said, “You will recall that the Oyo State PDP has been having a crisis for a long time which couldn’t be resolved. “All the reconciliation committees failed, starting from the Dr Saka Balogun-led committee, to Osun Former Governor Oyinlola committee, Chief Bode George, and finally Dr. Bukola Saraki. It is quite unfortunate that the NWC could not restore the peace we have been enjoying in the PDP since inception. My life has always been put under a series of threats for saying the truth. “It saddens my heart that the streets of Ibadan are occupied with thugs threatening my people here and there. It is on this note, I want to announce my resignation from the Peoples Democratic Party. “I, Alh Adebisi Olopooeyan hereby withdraw my membership from the Peoples Democratic Party”.
