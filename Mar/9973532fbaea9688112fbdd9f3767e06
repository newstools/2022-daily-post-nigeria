Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Lekan Balogun has elevated nine chiefs from the Balogun line, NAN reports. The promotion is the traditional ruler’s first official function since his coronation on March 11, 2022. All Olubadan-in-Council members except Osi-Olubadan, Rashidi Ladoja (former Oyo Governor), attended the ceremony. Oba Balogun urged the chiefs to justify the confidence reposed in them by Ibadan people for whom they hold their titles in trust. The monarch charged them to use the new positions to serve the people and humanity. “The elevation calls for more commitment, loyalty and sacrifice. I pray that our ancestors will grant you the ability to meet up with the demands of your respective titles,” he noted.
