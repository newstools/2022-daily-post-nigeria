Nigeria police officers deployed to the Eagle Square in Abuja for the ongoing All Progressives Congress, APC, National Convention on Saturday, foiled attempts by some hoodlums to disrupt the election processes. The police officers and other security agencies were able to stop the hoodlums who were seen carrying sticks to the venue of the convention. DAILY POST reports that some of the hoodlums who forced themselves into the venue where the convention is currently ongoing, were arrested and taken to the Force Headquarters. The incident forced some journalists to vacate the area as police were firing teargas to disperse the hoodlums. The Federal Capital Territory Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Josephine Adeh, who confirmed the incident in a chat with DAILY POST, said normalcy was restored immediately. Reacting to the use of teargas by the officers, the PPRO said the teargas was used to arrest the situation and forestall possible attacks on delegates who came from all over the country. She said, “In such an occasion with a certain considerable level of crowd, dispersal moves are necessary otherwise even the delegates won’t have a way and a place to play their roles. “All I can say is that strict surveillance is on ground and the police have been collecting any material that could be used to cause harm to people.”
