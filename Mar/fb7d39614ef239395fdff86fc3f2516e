Two suspects have been arrested in connection to the missing 22-year-old fashion designer, Ayanwole Oluwabamise. Oluwabamise was said to have gone missing on February 26 after boarding a Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) service from Chevron Bus Stop, Lekki, to Oshodi around 7pm. Lagos State Commissioner of Police Abiodun Alabi confirmed that two suspects have been arrested and are providing useful information to detectives at the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID), Panti. Alabi appealed to residents to avoid utterances and actions that could jeopardize investigations. The CP mentioned that the BRT driver is yet to be apprehended. Reports over the weekend had it that the missing lady sent distress messages to her friend when she felt uncomfortable in the BRT bus as a result of the driver’s conduct. She sent the vehicle details to her friend and asked her to pray for her in case anything happened to her. “The case is delicate and we are being careful to avoid jeopardizing investigation. The young girl is yet to be found. The suspect too disappeared almost the same time. “So, releasing names of those in custody or giving certain details could tip him off or even put the victim in more danger. “Suspect, who hails from Moba Local Government Area in Ekiti State, is about 5 feet plus tall, dark in complexion and speaks Yoruba and English languages well,” ALabi told The Nation.
