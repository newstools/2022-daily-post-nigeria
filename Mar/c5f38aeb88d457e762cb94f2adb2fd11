A cross-section of youths from the 31 Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State has distanced themselves from Governor Udom Emmanuel’s choice of successor in 2023. They noted that the governor’s action does not represent their collective decision and the interest of the masses insisting that they would go-ahead to pursue their collective interest for the 2023 gubernatorial election. The PDP youths gave the indication over the weekend in Uyo. The Coordinator of Onofiok Luke People’s Movement, Comrade Ekemini Smart said they were not perturbed by the governor’s preferred successor as far as the governor does not interfere with their own choice of candidate. He said, “The governor’s decision was his personal decision; it does not represent our collective decision and the interest of the masses; so we will go ahead to pursue our collective interest.” Also, the Director-General of Amazing Grace Campaign Organisation, Mr. Imo Udo, while Inaugurating the chapter coordinators of the group lauded the youths for their peaceful disposition and in mobilising themselves across the state to support Barr. Luke.
