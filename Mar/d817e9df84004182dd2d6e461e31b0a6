Korra, who just had a new baby girl, took to her Instagram page thanking her fans for the support in this trying time. She noted that she’s committed to taking care of herself at the moment for the sake of her newborn baby ‘Athena’. Korra said: “So, I’m going to be 100% committed to taking care of my newborn and myself. “When mama is good, the baby is good, thank you all for reaching out and everything, I honestly don’t know what I’ll do without your support. “I hope that me finding the strength to come up here will make you happy.” The couple have two children together and have been married since 2018.
