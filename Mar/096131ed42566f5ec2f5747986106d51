Leicester City winger, Ademola Lookman, has revealed why he dumped England for Nigeria. Lookman represented England at youth levels and was even part of the U-20 side that won the FIFA World Cup in South Korea back in 2017. The 24-year-old, who received approval from the Federation Of International Football Association (FIFA) last month, said he accepted to represent Nigeria through his parents. Lookman made his debut against the Black Stars of Ghana in a 2022 FIFA World Cup playoff last Friday in Kumasi after he replaced Moses Simon in the 74th minute during the encounter. “I am very excited to be part of Nigeria’s national team and I am feeling blessed and looking forward to helping the team,” Lookman told CAFOnline.com. “Both my parents are Nigerians and I have always seen these [representing Nigeria] as a possibility. I came to Nigeria frequently when I was much younger. “I am familiar with the people and built up a family here, so the switch from England to Nigeria is not an unusual one for me. I am glad I made the switch.”
