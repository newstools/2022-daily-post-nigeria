The New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP, has said the mass turnout it witnessed during its ward congress across the country is a warning signal to the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, ahead of the 2023 general election. NNPP became a third force in the country’s politics after prominent personalities showed interest to join. It conducted its ward congress on Tuesday, in accordance with the party’s schedule to elect the new executives ahead of the 2023 general election. DAILY POST visited some of the polling units in Jigawa State and observed that the exercise was conducted through direct primaries. Speaking while addressing the party members in Ringim ward, the Organizing Secretary, Tijjani Shu’aibu said the ward Congress was conducted peacefully across all the 287 wards in the State under the supervision of security agencies, INEC officials and National officials of the party. He said the NNPP was out to bring hope for Nigerians and change the narrative of politics in Nigeria. The development comes days after the State party chairman in Jigawa State said the NNPP is expecting to receive over 300,000 new members from the PDP. Their defection may not be unconnected with the recent feud between the faction under the former Governor of the State, Dr. Sule Lamido and that of the two-term gubernatorial candidate, Malam Aminu Ibrahim Ringim.
