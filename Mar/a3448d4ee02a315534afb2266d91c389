Paris Saint-Germain forward, Neymar, has dismissed reports of a ‘fight’ between him and teammate, Gianluigi Donnarumma, following their Champions League round of 16 second-leg 3-1 defeat against Real Madrid. Real Madrid defeated PSG at Santiago Bernabeu, thanks to Karim Benzema’s hat-trick. Reports had emerged from MARCA that Neymar had an argument with Donnarumma in the dressing room after PSG’s loss to Real Madrid, adding that the Brazilian criticized the goalkeeper for his mistake that led to Benzema’s opening goal. However, Neymar has now come out to deny the report by sharing a screenshot of his last conversation with Donnarumma, insisting that their relationship is perfect. Donnarumma began the chat, sending Neymar a link to a MARCA English version of the story, which led to them talking in Spanish. “Ciao Ney. I’m sorry about yesterday. This news is unacceptable,” Donnarumma wrote. “Mate! Relax! This can happen in football. We are a team and we are with you. You’re still very young and you’re going to win loads! Keep your head up and let’s keep going. Hug,” replied Neymar. Neymar later wrote an Instagram story to criticize the report. The former Barcelona star wrote: “I hate coming here and talking about the news, but the stuff in the previous post is a lie. “There was no fight inside the dressing room. Incompetent journalists who want to promote themselves, give it a rest, okay?”
