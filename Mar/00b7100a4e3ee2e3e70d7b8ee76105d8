Nollywood actress, Mercy Aigbe has reacted to the accusation that she had an extramarital affair with her now-husband, Kazim Adeoti while she was married to ex, Lanre Gentry. Kazim Adeoti’s first wife, Oluwafunsho had accused Aigbe of sleeping with Kazim when her son was 5 months old and she was still married. But reacting to the accusations, Mercy in a new post on Instagram, said she has constantly been lied against despite explaining her situation and telling her side of the story. Her post read, “Some people say grant interviews, explain your side of the story, you say your truth to correct some false narratives out there, you owe it to people who genuinely love you. “You grant, some other people say you don’t need to explain yourself, it’s your life, Do you. “You are constantly lied on and some other people say let it slide, do not react, don’t say a word, for peace sake.” Mercy Aigbe had earlier granted an interview explaining she was never friends with the first wife and she’s happy as a second wife. Kazim, Mercy’s new husband had claimed in an interview that as a Muslim he had the right to more than one wife. He claimed he was not snatched from his first wife and is still working to straighten out issues in his first marriage.
