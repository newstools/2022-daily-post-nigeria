Some gunmen whose identities have not been revealed have reportedly killed Mrs. Fatimah, the only surviving daughter of the immediate past Iyalode of Ibadan land, Alhaja Aminat Abiodun. DAILY POST gathered that Fatimah was killed in the early hours of Wednesday in her residence located at Bashorun area of Ibadan. Sources said that the gunmen stormed her residence and shot her directly on the head. DAILY POST recalls that the deceased mother died at age of 93 in 2018. Aminat was until her death in 2018 the Iyalode of Ibadan land. Efforts made by DAILY POST to reach the Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the state police command, Adewale Osifeso, proved abortive.
