The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has expressed regrets as bandits attacked the Runway 05 axis of Kaduna airport on Saturday. Recall that bandits on Saturday stormed Kaduna State Airport, stopping an aircraft from taking off. A statement issued on FAAN’s Twitter handle said, a combined team of anti-banditry military personnel and Crime investigation unit of FAAN Aviation Security Department swiftly intervened for rescue operation. It also confirmed that one person died during the incident. FAAN said normalcy has since been restored at the airport and it recovered two motorbikes abandoned by the bandits. “Additionally, a heavy reinforcement team from the Nigerian Defence Academy is on ground to ensure safety and security of airport workers/users. “The FAAN Avsec Department has equally released operational vehicles to the team for patrol purposes. “The Authority uses this opportunity to sympathise with the family and friends of the victim of this unfortunate incident.” “We shall continue to give further update where necessary. “
