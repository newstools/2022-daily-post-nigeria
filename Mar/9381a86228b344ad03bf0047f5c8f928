The new leadership of the New Nigeria People’s Party in Nasarawa State has been inaugurated to pilot the affairs of the party for the next four years. The new party officials who emerged as consensus candidates from across the 13 Local Government Areas of the state during its congress, vowed to take over the leadership of Nasarawa State in 2023. The newly elected state chairman of the party, Sidi Bako, assured that the party was determined to ensure effective leadership in Nasarawa State to bring the dividends of democracy to residents of the state. He said, “The NNPP has a strong structure across the 13 Local Government Areas of the state and I am optimistic that our party will record a successful outing in the 2023 general election so that residents can enjoy the dividends of democracy.” He explained that they do not support godfatherism and the imposition of candidates, saying they don’t want anybody that is not loved by the people as it is a party that allows the people to choose their own leaders. He added that the party has three vice-chairmen from the three senatorial districts of the state and other officials who are fully ready to work for the progress of the party. God willing, they will take over power in 2023. Earlier, the North-Central Secretary of NNPP, Umar Auta, said the party was ready to ensure effective leadership in the state and the country in general. He noted that the party’s plan was to bring credible leaders whose vision is to change the fortune of the country from the numerous challenges confronting the nation at the moment and give Nigerians hope for the future. Some of the elected officials are Thomas Luka, secretary; Ladan Danlami, treasurer; Nasir Mariga, auditor general, among others.
