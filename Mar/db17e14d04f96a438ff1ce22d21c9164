Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, has said he cannot force Edinson Cavani to play for the club. Ragnick stated this after a 4-1 hammering in the hands of Manchester City on Sunday. Cavani was not included in United’s matchday squad and not featured for the Red Devils since February 8. Rangnick has now revealed the Uruguay striker trained for three days, but felt he was not fit enough to face the Premier League champions. “Edi trained in the last three days, he trained well, but he still felt after yesterday afternoon that he’s not fit to play. “As a manager I cannot force a player to play if he doesn’t feel fit enough and well enough to play,” Rangnick said.
