Apostle Johnson Suleman of the Omega Fire Ministries, Auchi, Edo State, has said that Arsenal are back to the UEFA Champions League. Suleman said this while reacting to Arsenal’s Premier League 1-0 victory against Aston Villa on Saturday. Recall that Bukayo Saka netted the only goal of the game in the 30th minute as Mikel Arteta’s side defeated Aston Villa at Villa Park. The win over Aston Villa means the Gunners are now in fourth position on the Premier League table with 54 points from 28 games. The North London club are behind Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea on the log. In a tweet via his Twitter handle, Sulema, a passionate Arsenal fan, wrote: “Aston Villa 0-1 Arsenal. Lovely to see the boys grind out results the way they just did Well done! “Barring Any surprise, we are back to UCL Brilliant.” Arsenal’s next Premier League fixture is against Crystal Palace on April 4.
