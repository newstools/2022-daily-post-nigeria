Manchester United have chosen Erik ten Hag as their next permanent manager because they want someone who can create a strong playing identity at Old Trafford, according to The Times. The Dutchman is now far ahead of Mauricio Pochettino of Paris Saint-Germain, Luis Enrique of Spain and Julen Lopetegui for the top job at Old Trafford. United hierarchy is said to have been impressed with Ten Hag after opening talks with him last Monday as they consider their options on who takes over from Ralf Rangnick on a permanent basis. The 52-year-old has won multiple trophies since his appointment at Ajax in 2017 and has been praised for instilling an exciting style of football at the club. The Red Devils want their next manager to create a strong playing identity and Hag has been chosen to take over in the summer. The report said Pochettino, Enrique and Lopetegui would still be interviewed by the club’s hierarchy but United is concerned the trio are more interested in rebuilding the club through transfers, rather than addressing the playing style. United will still make contact with Pochettino who now faces the task of knocking Ten Hag off the perch as the club’s number one choice.
