Simon Ekpa, self-acclaimed disciple of the leader of Indigenous People of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, has said the Biafra agitators will not forgive the Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi over his alleged activities towards the agitators. Recall that a Federal High Court in Abuja had on Tuesday, sacked the governor and his Deputy, Dr Kelechi Igwe, over their defection from Peoples Democratic Party, PDP to the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC Justice Inyang Ekwo in a judgment, stated that the votes that brought them to office belonged to the opposition party and cannot hold on to the votes having elected to jettison the party that nominated them. Umahi has, however, declared that he still remain in his position as the governor of the state, stressing that the order from court was unconstitutional. Reacting, Ekpa, who is a dual citizen of both Nigeria and Finland said in a tweet on his official Twitter handle that the governor was earlier warned against affiliating with the ruling party. He said, “The name of the new Governor of Ebonyi State is called Uduma something… Tell Umahi that Biafrans will never forgive him. We warned the little Hitler of Ebonyi State, he never believed a day like this will come. “Umahi said the only way he can vacate the office of the governor of Ebonyi State is by death, resignation or impeachment by the state house of Assembly. “The question now is, why same Umahi has been parading himself with Hope Uzodinma who became governor without these three steps”.
