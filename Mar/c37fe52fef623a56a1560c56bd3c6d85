Nollywood actor, Akah Nnani has berated his colleagues who are singing and praying for presidential aspirants. Akah, in a post on his Instagram page, urged entertainers to act with purpose, adding that any public figure or entertainer who prays or sings at any political event had endorsed that candidate. This is coming after Timi Dakolo sang for former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, at his official declaration for the 2023 presidential race. Also Taribo West prayed for Asiwaju Tinubu, which has since stirred reactions. The 35-year-old actor demanded that entertainers should turn down money to perform for any candidate. His post read: “If you pray at a political event or you sing for a politician, you have endorsed that candidate. “As public figures/entertainers, we don’t have the luxury of taking our image or work lightly. Not now. “We must act with purpose and be burdened with posterity. Let’s walk the talk. “We have to start choosing sides now. This is a public announcement to all, but especially to my fellow colleagues. It’s not by screaming about what is wrong with the country when it is convenient. “It’s hard sometimes but you have to turn down that money. We already know who our enemies are. From now, you have to decide on whose side you are on.” Concluding, Akah asked entertainers and public figures to use their platform to spread hope for a better future. “Are you for the people or are you for the old systems? It’s that simple. Are you for the money? Are you for the generation that has failed us time and time again? And dealt wickedly with us during the protests? Or are you about looking for alternatives and the new generation and using your platform and the gift of influence that you have to spread hope for a better future? “Answer these questions now and choose your side. But Whatever you choose, stay consistent,” he added.
