Petrol end users, especially motorists in Damaturu, the Yobe State capital, have continued to suffer fuel scarcity as the product is now sold for as high as N250 per litre. According to reports, the situation is even worse in major towns of like Potiskum, Gashu’a, Nguru and Geidam, where the product sometimes goes as high as N270 to N300 per litre. The resultant effects of the scarcity have resulted in the forming of long queues in the few stations the commodity is available. Some motorists, who spoke to newsmen, said that they spent more than four to five hours on the queue just to get fuel at the official pump price at the NNPC Mega Station. Checks by DAILY POST showed that the situation at the station saw combined security of Department of State Services (DSS), Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), the police and a few members of the Yobe State Petroleum Task Force controlling the crowd and ensuring the smooth sales of the product. An official of the Task Force revealed that about three Golf drivers were arrested for what he called recycle buying. A member of the task force said, “We arrested three Golf drivers who are black makers here at the station. They have constructed big tanks under their vehicles and they come to queue, buy and go out to empty the tanks and come back again”. The sales of the product at the mega station has forced drivers to abandon other marketers selling at exorbitant rates.
