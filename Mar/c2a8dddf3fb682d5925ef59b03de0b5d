A Lagos lawmaker, Mr. Jude Idimogu has called on Sen. Bola Tinubu, Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu and other leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the State to wade into the leadership crisis rocking Ndigbo in Lagos APC ahead of the 2023 general elections. Idimogu, a two-term member of the Lagos State House of Assembly representing Oshodi-Isolo Constituency II, made the appeal on Saturday in Lagos, following the clash between his loyalists and loyalists of Mr Joe Igbokwe, the Special Adviser to Gov. Sanwo-Olu on Drainage Services. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the clash occurred at the official inauguration of Executive Members of Ndigbo in APC, Lagos State, Ejigbo Local Council Development Area (LCDA) Chapter, at the party secretariat. Both Igbokwe, the apex leader of Ndigbo in Lagos APC, and Idimogu, his deputy, on Saturday disagreed over the list of executive members of Ndigbo in Lagos APC, Ejigbo LCDA Chapter. The inauguration was conducted by Igbokwe, amidst protest from the group loyal to Idimogu, who vowed that the event would not hold because they were not carried along. Speaking with newsmen after the rancorous inauguration, Idimogu said that the inauguration was not supposed to hold until all interest groups were harmonised so as not to deepen trouble among Ndigbo in Lagos APC. The lawmaker added: “Election is coming and the party knows that in this particular zone we have a lot of non-indigenes and they are watching. “I am appealing to my leaders, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Mr Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Rt- Hon. Mudashiru Obasa, Lagos APC Chairman, Hon. Cornelius Ojelabi and other leaders to call Igbokwe to order. “The party should intervene. We don’t want our party to fail in the 2023 elections. Igbos must be carried along.”
