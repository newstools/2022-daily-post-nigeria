A Bill to regulate the placement of outdoor advertising structures in Akwa Ibom State, on Monday, March 21, passed Second Reading at the State House of Assembly. Sir Udo Kierian Akpan (Oruk Anam), who sponsored the Bill, noted during plenary that the bill, when passed, will mandate every outdoor advertising agent to register with a relevant government ministry or agency with unique registration numbers. Akpan, who is the Leader of the House, also expressed displeasure over indiscriminate placement of advertising structures in the state without the vendors being members of a recognised advertising body or obtaining permission from a relevant government ministry. Some of the lawmakers, who spoke in favour of the Bill including Barr Aniefiok Denis (Etinan), Elder Mark Esset (Nsit Atai), Dr Usoro Akpanusoh (Ibeno/Esit Eket), Rt. Hon. David Lawrence (Eket) and Elder Aniekan Uko (Ibesikpo Asutan), noted that the Bill was apt and timely as it will ensure decency in the state, especially during the electioneering period. They also noted that the Bill will prevent disorderliness and double taxation by providing a clear-cut law for the advertising industry in the state. The Bill was later referred to the House Committee on Environment who is expected to report back within one month. Also, the House received a list of six nominees from Governor Udom Emmanuel for appointment into the State Executive Council. The nominees are Barr. Bassey Okon (Itu), Offiong Ofor (Ini), Aniefiok Nkom (Ikot Ekpene), Iniobong Ekong (Nsit Ubium), Bob Emem (ONNA) and Engr. Camillus Umoh (Essien Udim). In his remarks, the Speaker of the House, Rt. Hon.Aniekan Bassey, referred the list to the House Committee on Judiciary, Justice, Human Rights and Public Petitions for further legislative action.
