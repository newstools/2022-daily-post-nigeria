Super Eagles coach, Augustine Eguavoen has lamented the absence of two key players in the two-legged World Cup playoff between Nigeria and Ghana. Eguavoen will not be able to select Alex Iwobi (suspension) for the game while Ghana will also miss the services of Andre Ayew Eguavoen believes that suspended Ayew, who is the captain of the Black Stars, would have loved to face the Super Eagles. The Swansea City player will not be at the disposal of Ghana manager, Otto Addo as he serves a suspension from a red card in a 2021 Africa Cup of Nations clash against Comoros. Speaking on the absence of Ayew, Eguavoen also reminded Ghanaian journalist Juliet Bawuah, that Iwobi is not in the picture. “It’s quite unfortunate the young man will be missing both games and I’m very sure it’s the kind of game he wants to play as well being the captain. “But it is what it is, Iwobi is also not coming, he’s a player we are also going to miss a lot but that is not the focus right now. “The focus is on playing with people that we have and just work out and try to win the game because Iwobi remains part of us, he’s going to be there with us in spirit not physically.”
