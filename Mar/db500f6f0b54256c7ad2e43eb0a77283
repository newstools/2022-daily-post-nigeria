Veteran Nollywood actor, Kanayo. O. Kanayo has reacted to reports that he is dead. Kanayo’s reported death had on Wednesday surfaced on social media with some Nigerians writing RIP on his pictures. But the actor in a video posted on his Instagam page, denied the report. He also cursed the person that started the rumour. He said, ”I don’t know what people gain by carrying out rumors, printing out their own obituary. I don’t know what will make someone wake up in the morning and start tagging someone. Do you think Nollywood actors and entertainer don’t have families? ”Somebody wakes up compiles three to five pictures and write RIP? You will not live past the next seven days. My life has never been in anyone’s hand. ”I want to thank friends who have been calling since morning. I am hale and hearty, I don’t even have fever. Whoever has published his own obituary will exit this world in seven days.”
