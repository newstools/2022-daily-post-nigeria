Argentina head coach, Lionel Scaloni, has hinted that Lionel Messi could play his last game in front of the home crowd on Friday against Venezuela in a 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifier playoff. Scaloni said the Paris Saint-Germain forward could say goodbye to Argentina in the best way after the match against Venezuela. The 43-year-old said at his pre-match press conference on Thursday. “Tomorrow, he [Lionel Messi] has the opportunity to play in his country, with his people,” Scaloni said at his pre-match press conference on Thursday. “Surely the last match we could play here and he can say goodbye to Argentina in the best way and hope that the future is even better.” He added, “Leo is good, he trained normally and is available to play. Leo is very comfortable in the Argentina national team.” Meanwhile, Messi was expected to miss the Venezuela tie after failing to make it to PSG’s matchday squad against Monaco due to illness. However, the former Barcelona captain trained normally with his Argentina teammates this week and will be one of the first names on the team sheet to face Venezuela. Argentina has already qualified for this year’s World Cup in Qatar. Scaloni’s men will face Venezuela and Ecuador in their final two qualifiers.
