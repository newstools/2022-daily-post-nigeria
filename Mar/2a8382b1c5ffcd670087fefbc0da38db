Many passengers were feared dead in a fatal road crash along Potiskum-Bauchi highway, about 20 kilometers from Potiskum town, Yobe State. The accident, which occurred on Sunday evening, involved a Borno Express Toyota Bus, which collided with a Vectra Saloon Car conveying passengers from Jos to Maiduguri. All the occupants of the Vectra were said to have lost their lives. Four out of the eighteen passengers on board the Borno Express, including the driver of the bus, were among those confirmed dead, DAILY POST learnt. The dead bodies have been deposited at the mortuary of the Specialists’ Hospital Potiskum, while those injured are receiving treatment at the medical facility. Governor Mai Mala Buni had last month ordered full enforcement of road traffic laws in the State to curb the menace of road accidents. Buni gave the order following an increase in the number of accidents on highways in the State, with a charge on motorists to be more careful on the road. “We must enforce the laws to curb these avoidable accidents,” he added.
