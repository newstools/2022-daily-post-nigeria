Lionel and Neymar were booed by Paris Saint-Germain fans on Sunday in their first game since their dramatic Champions League collapse to Real Madrid on Wednesday. The Ligue 1 leaders took on Bordeaux and both players were roundly booed by the home supporters and their every touch jeered. However, there was no such treatment for Kylian Mbappe, who is likely to move to Real Madrid on a free transfer in the summer. At one point during the first half, the fans booed as Messi and Neymar stood over a free-kick and then sarcastically cheered when Neymar hit his effort over the bar. PSG eventually won 3-0, with Mbappe, Neymar and Paredes scoring the goals. The victory moves them 15 points clear at the top and continues their march toward the title.
