Manchester United legend, Paul Scholes, has named Manchester City’s Kevin De Bruyne as the best midfielder on the planet. This was after the Belgian shone in Manchester City’s 4-1 win, scoring two of the goals over Manchester United on Sunday. The Belgium international netted twice for City in the opening half in their derby win and helped his side completely control the second half before going off in the 80th minute. The 30-year-old City midfielder controlled the midfield and outclassed their opponents, scoring his 51st Premier League goal. Scholes, who was one of the best midfielders for his club and country during his playing days, was not just impressed by De Bruyne’s goal-scoring, but everything in his game. “He’s the best Premier League midfielder there is and probably the best in the world. I can’t think of anyone else who touches him,” Scholes told Premier League Productions. “He does everything. It’s alright having these footballers who are great passes, keep possession well. “But this lad scores goals, makes goals, he defends, his passes are brilliant. “He’s got absolutely everything that you’d want in a top class midfielder. ‘It’s difficult to stop him…every time he gets the ball he’s thinking about a goal. He’s thinking about assisting a goal or scoring a goal and it’s a great attitude to have.”
