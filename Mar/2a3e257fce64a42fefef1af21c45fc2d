The Publicity Secretary of the Young Progressives Party (YPP), Nnaemeka Isaa has called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to be serious with the registration of the masses for the upcoming 2023 general elections. Isaac made the call while featuring in a radio programme in Umuahia and monitored by DAILY POST on Saturday. The YPP spokesman lamented the time electorates in Abia State wait to be registered and revalidated by INEC officials, calling on the Abia Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) to sit up to his responsibility and not disenfranchise eligible voters. He also called on the State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu to probe all road contracts being handled by the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). On growth and preparation of the party ahead of the 2023 general election in Abia, Isaac restated the YPP has come to stay, just as he disclosed that the state leadership had inaugurated one hundred and eighty-four ward party chairmen by the state chairman, Chimex Nelson Uluocha, declaring that the YPP is poised and repositioned to take over the governance of Abia State come 2023. The party’s mouthpiece said, “YPP has come to stay in Abia, southeast and Nigeria as a whole. Recently, we inaugurated 184 party ward Chairmen across the seventeen local government areas of Abia state. This is part of the repositioning process of the party to actively participate in the electoral process at the state and national level, especially as the 2023 general election is fast approaching. Asked to react to the recent outcry by women in the country during the 2022 Internation Women Day, over alleged exclusion in governance, the Abia Publicity Secretary, described Young Progressive Party as gender-sensitive. Isaac said, “YPP has over 65 women as Ward chairmen and over 5 women in the State Working Committee (SWC) of the party.
