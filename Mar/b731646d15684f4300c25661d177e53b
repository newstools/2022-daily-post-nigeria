Simon Ekpa, a self-acclaimed disciple of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has alleged that Nigeria’s Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, is the leader of the Fulani drug cartel. He claimed that Malami is under pressure to exonerate suspended police officer, Abba Kyari from extradition to the United States. His tweet read: “Malami, the AGF of Nigeria is leading the Fulani Drug cartel. “He is under pressure to use his power to exonerate Abba Kyari and make sure he is not extradited to the US, but unfortunately it is too late.” Simon Ekpa on his official Twitter page also promised to expose Malami’s involvement in the government drug cartel. “We will soon expose Malami involvement in the government drug cartel,” he tweeted. Meanwhile, Malami has denied exonerating Kyari, explaining that the case was in progress and that his office only requested “further probe in relation to some aspects of the investigation”. Malami stressed that “no conclusion has been reached in the direction of the absence of evidence relating to the First Report”.
