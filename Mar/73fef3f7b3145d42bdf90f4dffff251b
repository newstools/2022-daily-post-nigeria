The member representing the people of Burutu Federal Constituency, Rt.Hon. Julius Pondi, Friday, said candidates from the three Senatorial Districts in Delta State should be allowed to contest the governorship election in 2023, irrespective of the much-talked-about zoning formula in the state. The federal lawmaker made the assertion during a chat with newsmen at the just-concluded maiden launch/unveiling of Congress Newspaper held in Warri. “Come 2023, all of us can contest. Whoever that emerges, we can form a team from there.” Rt Hon. Pondi argued that candidates from the various senatorial districts had contested the governorship elections in previous years and a winner emerged. According to Rt.Hon. Pondi, “Have you seen the declaration made by the central in 2014? If there was a zoning, what was that declaration for? Whoever becomes the governor is a Deltan.”
