Nigerian music legend, Tuface Idibia has defended his wife, Annie, after her brother accused her of maltreating him. Annie’s brother, Wisdom, in a trending video, accused his sister of stripping him of the car and everything she gave him. He also accused her of treating him as a slave. Reacting, Annie denied all allegations stating that her brother is entitled and is upset she refused to employ him as her manager. Tuface, in her defence, took to his Instagram story calling out family members who are enemies. He wished Wisdom all the best while expressing disappointment in his utterances. Tuface on Instagram wrote: “Dear Wisdom, I hope you are happy with this post, I hope you will continue to stand by this post. Well no matter what it’s still nothing but best wishes and prayers from Annie and I. “It’s funny how some people react when you tell them the truth. Even I am guilty of it sometimes but that is no excuse I pray for Wisdom. “I understand people telling Annie not to respond but this cuts deep. “May Allah guide our path, One love from me and Annie. Respect to family but sometimes some family is your worst enemy.”
