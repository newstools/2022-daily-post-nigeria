Barcelona manager, Xavi Hernández, has revealed how his team will approach their LaLiga El Clasico against Real Madrid. Real Madrid will on Sunday night host Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabeu. The Los Blancos head to the game after beating Mallorca 3-0 in their last game in the LaLiga, while Barcelona eliminated Galatasaray from the Europa League. Speaking at his pre-match press conference on Saturday, Xavi said Barcelona would approach the Real Madrid game with the intention to get three points, adding that the Catalan club will attack the host in front of their fans. “It is very special. It is a tough and complicated game [Real Madrid vs Barcelon],” Xavi said. “Playing there is always difficult. We are going to attack and play to get three points.” “Winning tomorrow puts us in a good position to achieve our first objective, which is to get into the Champions League,” he added.
