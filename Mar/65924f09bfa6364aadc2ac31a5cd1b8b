The Nigeria Police Force, Katsina State Command, on Friday, said it repelled bandits’ attack on two villages, Gidan Nasheku and Kwantakwamawa in Kankara Local Government Area of the State. In a statement on Friday by its Public Relations Officer, SP Gambo Isah, he said the troops rescued four female kidnap victims. According to him, the kidnappers, who entered the two communities early morning on Friday, started shooting sporadically. He said all the rescued victims were nursing mothers who were unable to run during bandits’ attack. He said the rescue of the victims was possible because they received distress call from the affected villages. He said during the attacks, the Divisional Police Officer of Kankara led a team of policemen to the area and engaged the terrorists in a gun duel. Isah, while calling on residents to always provide useful information on or before bandits’ attack, noted that the command was ever battle ready to face bandits and other criminals terrorising the State. He added that some of the terrorists fled with gunshot injuries, adding that a team of policemen are presently combing the bush to arrest the wounded terrorists or recover their dead bodies.
