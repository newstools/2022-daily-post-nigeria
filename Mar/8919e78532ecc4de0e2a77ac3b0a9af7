Two men have confessed to administering an overdose of pentalin injection on a commercial tricyclist and taking his tricycle. The suspects, Habu Badiru, 27 and Auwal Lawan, 26, who are patent medicine vendors, confessed to killing the commercial tricycle operator, Algoni Goni of Uba in Adamawa State through the pentalin overdose and making away with the tricycle. The duo claimed they killed Goni on March 4, 2022, and dumped his corpse in a river in Uba, Hong LGA, after which Habu rode on the tricycle to Mubi to sell it. The suspects narrated that they went after Goni’s tricycle so that they could raise N100,000 for Habu to settle a debt. Speaking to newsmen at the police headquarters in Adamawa State on Wednesday, Lawan said that they boarded the tricycle to the house of Habu where he and Habu held Goni and injected him with the pentalin. Lawan added that after injecting him, they strangled him, as a result of which he died instantly, and following which he and Habu carried the corpse to a river in Uba where they dumped it. Habu, who took the narration from there, said after killing Goni, he rode on the tricycle to Mubi to sell it, but people refused to buy due to lack of particulars, as a result of which he took the tricycle to neighbouring Mararaba Mubi and parked it there. The suspect said he took the tricycle to Mubi the second time the following morning to sell it, and that while in Mubi, he had to call someone from Uba, and that on arrival, the person asked how he (Habu) got the tricycle since he is a patent medicine vendor. He said it was the man who took the matter up by calling another person who turned up with a policeman that arrested him. Commenting on the matter, the Police Public Relations Officer in Adamawa State, DSP Suleiman Nguroje, confirmed the arrest and the confession of the suspects, and assured that they would be charged to court.
