Members of the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) in Plateau State under the aegis of APC Bigwigs have called on some aspirants jostling to get the party’s governorship ticket to desist from telling the electorates that they are the anointed candidates of Governor, Simon Lalong. The group, in an interaction with journalists, claimed Governor Lalong was an impartial man who obeys the rule of law and is known to give everyone a level playing ground and equal opportunity. The group’s spokesperson, Saleh Mandung Zazzaga said, “some of these aspirants are using the Governor’s name to craftily boost their candidature to mislead the people because Lalong has never declared that he has any anointed candidate. “We know those involved in this unhealthy campaign strategy and if they don’t desist we will report them to the party as well as the governor. Zazzaga further explained that the aspirants involved in such practice are trying to cause division and disaffection between the governor and other stakeholders, groups, individuals and interest parties in APC. He urged the public to disregard anyone campaigning with the Governor’s name, as such claims were “baseless and untrue”. Also, he urged the governor to investigate the matter and call those involved in the act to desist since his (Lalong) name is at stake.
