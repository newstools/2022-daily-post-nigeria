Chelsea sporting director, Petr Cech, has admitted the club is living “day-by-day” since the UK Government sanctioned its owner, Roman Abramovich. Cech also admitted he does not know whether the Blues can finish the season. Sanctions have been imposed leaving them hamstrung financially. Although Chelsea have been issued a special licence, they cannot conclude any transfers, renew contracts, sell new tickets or merchandise, and have significantly reduced travel budgets and home match costs. Speaking on Sunday, Cech said: “We have to admit that we go day by day, because it’s not in our hands. “The conversations are going on (so) that we can operate in a way that we can finish the season. “Obviously it’s a difficult situation and we’re part of the Premier League as well, one of the best competitions in the world and I believe that for us to carry on to finish the season, it would obviously help everybody involved in the Premier League too.”
