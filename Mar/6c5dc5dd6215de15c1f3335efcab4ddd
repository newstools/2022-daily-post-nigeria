An aide to Willie Obiano, the outgoing governor of Anambra State, Mr. Uzuegbunam Okagbue, has challenged Senator Victor Umeh over his aspiration to go to the Senate. Okagbue, who declared interest to run for the Anambra Central Senatorial Zone, urged the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) to look beyond Senator Umeh, but hand its ticket to an aspirant that can win election, stating that Umeh was not salable. Speaking at a press conference in his home at Umunachi, Dunukofia Local Government Area of Anambra State, Okagbue said he is more prepared for the task, and promised to make Anambra Central proud if allowed to represent the zone. “We need younger and more vibrant people to represent Anambra Central. The Senate is not a retirement home where politicians who have served in various positions are settled to go and rest. “I represent something different in Anambra Central, and I assure you that if I represent Anambra Central, they will begin to see what is different.” Okagbue, who worked as Chief Protocol to Governor Willie Obiano, and also as Deputy Chief of Staff for eight years, said he is better prepared for the election, adding that it’s high time a youth was sent to represent the zone. “I have public and private sector experience. Having worked with the governor for eight years and also as a banker previously for eight years, I believe I’m more prepared for the job. “We can not be giving the ticket of our party to one man, during every election, and he will not win the election. We need to try fresh people, and that is what I represent. “People like Victor Umeh should rather wait and be playing advisory roles in the party, because if we give him our ticket, he may lose it.”
