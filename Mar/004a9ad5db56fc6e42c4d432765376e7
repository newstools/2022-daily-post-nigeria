Former Minister of Youth and Sports, Solomon Dalung has warned rumour mongers to stop associating him with the National Working Committee of the NNPP, saying he is still an APC member. Dalung on Wednesday handed down the warning in a post via his verified Facebook page, while reacting to some news making round that linked him with the said political party. In the post, Dalung described the development as not only strange but also embarrassing to his personality. “I am not aware, privy or part of such political development”. He also posted as saying, “there are many Coalition Movements re-strategizing ahead of 2023 in view of the imminent collapse of internal democracy in the two major political parties. The National Movement is one of these like mind political clusterings with the sole intentions of rescuing democracy. I know as a fact that it is about the national interest and not the political ambition of any individual member. “Therefore, including my name on a National Working Committee of NNPP without consent or due consultations is bad political branding technic of desperate politicians”. The Former Youth Minister urged the general public to disregard this action as it does not have his endorsement while demanding an apology from those who have dragged his name into their 2023 power permutations. “Let me reiterate my commitments to supporting a presidential candidate of Southern extraction who must not be above 60 years of age. I believe that it is in the interest of, fairness, equity, justice, peace and unity to zone power to Southern Nigeria and especially the youths in 2023”. Solomon Dalung in the Facebook post stressed that he has not changed his party membership, hence calling on the public to consider those publications linking him with the interim Leadership of NNPP as fake news, baseless and unfounded which should be discountenanced.
