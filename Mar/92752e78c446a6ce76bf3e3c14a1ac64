Motorists and Keke Napep riders in Zamfara State have commended the Task force on security for working to ease the long queues that exist in almost all the filling stations in the State. According to them, there seems to be a little relief as the chairman of the committee, Hon. Abubakar Mohammed Dauran was leading his team to various filling stations to control the long queues in the State. “He deploys members of the taskforce committee in all filling stations in order to help and ease the long queues in Gusau metropolis and at the local government levels,” they added. According to the publicity sub-committee chairman of the Taskforce, Comrade Bello Mohammed Book, the deployment of the Taskforce members to various filling stations has put in place efficient service delivery in almost all the filling stations. Many people interviewed by DAILY POST at the NNPC Mega station, Salbas, AA Rano & Danmarna filling stations said that without the efforts of the Taskforce members, they would have suffered before having access to fuel.
