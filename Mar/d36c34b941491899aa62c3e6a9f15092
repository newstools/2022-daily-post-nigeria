The Academy has condemned Will Smith’s action on Chris Rock at the Oscars 2022. Will Smith, before he won Best Actor for his role in ‘King Richard’, slapped presenter, Chris Rock for joking about his wife, Jada Pinkett. Chris Rock, presenting the award for best documentary, said “Jada I love you, ‘G.I. Jane 2,’ cannot wait to see it.” Minutes after, Will Smith walked up to the stage and slapped Rock, warning him not to mention his wife’s name, as he returned to his seat. In a terse statement shared on its official Twitter handle, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which presents the Oscars, said it did not “condone violence.” The academy wrote: “The Academy does not condone violence of any form. “We are delighted to celebrate our 94th Academy Awards winners, who deserve this moment of recognition from their peers and movie lovers around the world.” Also, the Los Angeles Police Department, LAPD has said Chris Rock would not be filing a police report against Will Smith. “LAPD investigative entities are aware of an incident between two individuals during the Academy Awards program. “The incident involved one individual slapping another. The individual involved has declined to file a police report. If the involved party desires a police report at a later date, LAPD will be available to complete an investigative report,” the LAPD said in a statement.
