Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen, has compared Nigeria and Ghana players ahead of his side’s 2022 FIFA World Cup playoff against the Black Stars on Tuesday in Abuja. Osimhen said Nigeria have quality players that can come in from the bench and get the job done, while Ghana have great quality players in their national team. Speaking to NFF TV, the Napoli attacker said: “We have to give respect to the Ghanaian team also, they have some great quality players, but we are ready. “We have good quality players, individual talents that can actually win games for us and we have very good squad depth. “On the bench also we have quality players that can come in and get the job done for us and we are really looking forward to this game as a group.” Meanwhile, Nigeria and Ghana played a 0-0 draw in the first leg tie in Kumasi on Friday.
