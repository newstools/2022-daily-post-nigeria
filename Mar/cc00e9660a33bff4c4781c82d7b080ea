Former Manchester United striker, Odion Ighalo, has urged the Super Eagles of Nigeria to focus on themselves ahead of their 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against the Black Stars of Ghana. Ighalo, who missed the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, also said he is determined to help Nigeria secure a spot at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar later this year. The former Watford star was named in the 32-man provisional squad for the qualifiers against Ghana by interim technical adviser Augustine Eguavoen on Friday. The first leg of the clash will take place at the Cape Coast Stadium on March 25, while the reverse fixture will take place at the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja, four days later. “It’s always a great opportunity to represent Nigeria and the ambition now is to help our country get the ticket against a very tough Ghana team,” Ighalo told BBC Sport Africa. “It was a big disappointment not to play at AFCON, but that is in the past because this is another chance for me. “We have two big games against a very strong and equally ambitious side, but we must focus on ourselves. Playing at the last World Cup was a dream come true for many of us and we have two games to prove that we deserve to compete on that stage again. “I am happy to be part of the squad again and I believe we have a squad and coaching crew good enough to achieve our goal.”
