Residents of Calabar and other major towns in Cross River State have attributed increasing waves of crime in parts of the state to the lack of street lights. They lamented that power instability has led to gangsterism, raping of girls and waylaying of unsuspecting residents. In an interview, Mr John Akanimo who is a public activist decried the absence of lights on major streets compared with what used to be before now. He also called on the state government to lighten many of the local streets where there are suspected black spots. Another resident, Francis Eteng who lives at the Bayside area of Calabar South said, “Street lights will tremendously reduce crimes. Presently, the lack of streets has increased petty and major crimes in Calabar. This is why we strongly appeal to the state government to help us lighten our streets and stabilise the power supply. “This way, they can also be helping smalltime entrepreneurs and shop owners to stay afloat and feed their families”, he said. Speaking during a public event in Calabar, the Chairman of Calabar South LGA, Mrs Esther Bassey said her administration has electrified some streets and is ready to increase the number of streets with street lights. She appealed to boys who are alleged to be involved in neighbourhood crimes and vandalism of power installations to desist from it.
