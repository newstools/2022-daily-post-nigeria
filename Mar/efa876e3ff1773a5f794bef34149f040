The pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, has observed with dismay that the Kaduna Airport attack by terrorists shows that Nigeria may be heading the Afghanistan way. Afenifere, therefore, enjoined the Federal Government to take decisive steps to handle the security situation of the country. Jare Ajayi, National Publicity Secretary of the group, in a statement, noted that it is a matter of serious concern that security infractions happened at a time that the government kept assuring Nigerians that it was on top of the situation. The group noted that some of the attacks by terrorists even occurred in broad daylight and cited the cases of Kaduna airport and that of Enugu. The statement explained, “With terrorists having the audacity to attack a national airport despite all the available security apparatus, it means that hardly is anywhere safe any longer in the country.” It stated that the Federal Government should immediately allow states to set up their police forces, empower the existing security agencies and stop treating terrorists with kid gloves, stressing that these must be done immediately so that Nigeria does not go the Afghanistan way. DAILY POST recalls that terrorists, numbering about 200, invaded the Kaduna Airport, preventing the take-off of an aircraft and killing a security official attached to the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency, thereby forcing workers at the airport to flee.
