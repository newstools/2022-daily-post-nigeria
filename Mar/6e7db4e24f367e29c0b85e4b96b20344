Former Arsenal playmaker, Mesut Ozil, has predicted the teams that win the Premier League, Champions League and World Cup. Ozil, in a social media post on Tuesday, indicated that Manchester City will go ahead to win the domestic title in England ahead of Liverpool. Pep Guardiola’s men currently hold a mere one-point advantage over the Reds in second place. He has however predicted Liverpool will win their seventh European crown this season with success in the Champions League. Jurgen Klopp’s men have been drawn against Benfica in the quarter-finals and will need to overcome either Bayern Munich or Villarreal in the semis if they are to qualify for the final. Ozil – a World Cup winner in 2014 – also threw his weight behind the Three Lions to win the World Cup in Qatar later this year.
