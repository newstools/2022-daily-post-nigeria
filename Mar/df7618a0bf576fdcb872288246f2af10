Bandits on Monday attacked a train heading to Kaduna from Abuja. It was gathered that bandits detonated a bomb on the railtrack of Abuja-Kaduna train and successfully immobilized it at a point between Katari and Rijana. It was also learnt that the attackers have surrounded the train, shooting sporadically. Confirming the incident, Shehu Sani, a former Kaduna Central Senator, said villagers around the area claim the train is under attack. “Villagers along Abuja-Kaduna road called to confirm hearing multiple gunshots and attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train by terrorists,” he wrote on Twitter. More to come.
