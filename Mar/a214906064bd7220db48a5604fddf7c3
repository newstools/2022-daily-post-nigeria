Justin Dean, the husband of popular Nigerian dancer, Korra Obidi, has announced he is divorcing her a week after they welcomed their second child. The couple welcomed their second child a week ago which was shown on Instagram live. In an Instagram post on Wednesday night, the American ‘Justin ‘ said “it is over” between them. According to him, he does not deserve how Korra treats him and has done his best to make the marriage work. “Korra Obidi and I are getting a divorce. It is over! I would not be treated this way any longer. “I did my absolute best to make it work. “I did not want this, I did my best, my heart is broken. I supported her, loved her and I don’t deserve the way I was treated,” his post read. It remains to be seen if Dean’s post was for real or a prank as fans think it can’t be real. However, in a follow-up post on his Instagram stories, the US doctor wrote: “Not a joke.”
