Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp, has identified the English clubs, Manchester City and Chelsea, as the team he wants the Reds to avoid in the Champions League. The Champions League quarter-final draw was conducted on Friday and Liverpool was paired with Benfica. Reflecting on the Champions League draw ahead of Liverpool’s FA Cup quarter-final tie with Nottingham Forest on Sunday, Klopp said at his pre-match press conference: “I would have taken everybody [in the Champions League], but the only thing I didn’t want was an English team [Manchester City and Chelsea]. “We had that in the past and we went through, we played a final against an English team, it is absolutely fine, in the final anyway you take whoever you get. “We play [the English clubs] often enough during a season and it is good if you play somebody else.”
