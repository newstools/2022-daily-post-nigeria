Chelsea star, Andreas Christensen, is close to joining Barcelona this year. According to Mundo Deportivo, Barcelona has accelerated their interest in Christensen ahead of his contract expiring during the summer transfer window. Christensen alongside AC Milana’s Franck Kessie is top of Barcelona’s wish list as they look to improve their squad. The Danish international joined Chelsea from Brondby in 2012, so a move would see his 10-year stay at Stamford Bridge come to an end. The 25-year-old has gone on to make more than 150 appearances for Chelsea, helping them win multiple trophies, including last season’s Champions League. Speaking about his Chelsea contract situation last week, Christensen said: “Things can still be done. Being part of a winning team is all that I want to be as a football player. “It is hard because of all the talks between the club and my guys, I try to keep it away because I want to focus and it has not changed for me. “I go on the pitch every day not really thinking about it. I leave that to the club and my guys, and I can focus on playing football.”
