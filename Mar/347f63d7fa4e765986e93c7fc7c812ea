The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) says it has rescued 10 children from suspected child traffickers and reunited them with their families in Imo State. Commandant of the NSCDC in the state, Mr Michael Ogar, revealed this to newsmen in Owerri on Tuesday, during the year 2022 International Day for Civil Defence, while mentioning his achievements since taking over as the command’s helmsman in April 2021. NSCDC also said that the command rescued two kidnapped persons, bound for transfer to Libya for prostitution and reunited them with their families. The commandant added that these were achieved through effective collaboration with the National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP). “On assumption of duty as state commandant, the anti-vandal unit was reinvigorated to perform optimally, leading to several arrests of vandals, confiscation of exhibits and prosecution of the suspects in Courts of competent jurisdiction. “In line with the Commandant-General’s formation of the NSCDC female Rapid Response Squad, Imo command has thoroughly trained 48 female officers and have deployed them to their various duty beats. “Under my watch, the peace and conflict unit has resolved over forty civil cases out of court, with efforts made in the area of clamping down on human traffickers in the state. “We have also rescued and reconnected over 10 missing children with their parents, arrested and transferred four cases of sexual abuse and molestation of underage children to the National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons.” The day was set aside by the International Civil Defence Organisation in 1990 to honour the significance of civil defence and the personnel who have sacrificed their lives for it. The theme for the year 2022 is: “Civil Defence and Management of Displaced Populations in the Face of Disaster and Crises; the Role of NSCDC in the Fight Against Pandemic”.
