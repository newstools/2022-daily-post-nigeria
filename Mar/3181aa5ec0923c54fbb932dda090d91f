National Secretary of the Young Progressives Party, YPP, Vidiyeno Bamaiyi, has described the recent court ruling on Governor Umahi and some state assembly members who defected to the All Progressives Congress, APC, from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, as a welcome development. He said the decision of the court of law will bring sanity and discipline into the political system and tame politicians’ voracious quest to change political parties without consequences for their actions. Answering questions from newsmen shortly after the state congress election of the YPP, in Ilorin on Saturday at the party’s secretariat, Bamaiyi said his party was in support of the court’s decision since people voted for the party where they belong and not for them. “There is no name of the candidate on the ballot paper, it is the party’s name, hence all votes garnered during election belong to the political party of the candidate. “If you win an election on a party’s platform and wish to defect to another party, you will have to vacate office to actualise your aim,” he added. Bamaiyi said ” the judiciary is living up to the expectations of Nigerians with that court ruling on defectors. “The court ruling on the defectors will regulate politicians jumping from one party to another without any ideology.” On the amended electoral act, the party’s scribe also noted that the YPP was excited about the new act because it is favourable to the party as “we have been following its provisions strictly.” Bamaiyi said the party will soon embark on massive mobilization of members registration exercise in the state, while the party’s primaries were also in the pipeline for the 2023 elections. Highlights of the state Congress election included reception for new members who decamped from other political parties to the YPP at the party’s secretariat.
