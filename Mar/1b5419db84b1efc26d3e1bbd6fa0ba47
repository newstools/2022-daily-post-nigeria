Nollywood Actress, Iyabo Ojo and Ngozi Nwosu have sympathized and prayed for their colleague, Kemi Afolabi over the state of her health. DAILY POST recalls that Afolabi had in a recent interview disclosed that the doctor told her she has five years to live after she was diagnosed with Lupus. Reacting in an Instagram post, Iyabo Ojo apologized to the actress for not keeping in touch. She prayed that God will heal her. Her post read, “I celebrate you today my dear Kemi Afolabi and I reject the doctor’s report
concerning our life. So sorry I haven’t kept in touch with you, I knew nothing and heard nothing. “My heart is really heavy with this sad news but I have faith that God will work his miracle in your life… he will not fail you. “I have called and left you a voice note and I will continue to encourage you and stand with you both in the open and closet. Love you girl. “Death is far away from you, you shall live long in his infinite mercy and grace, may his miraculous healing and miracle be upon you. Please say a little prayer for her.” Ngozi Nwosi in the comment section recounted how she battled with kidney illness and prayed that God who healed her would do the same for Kemi Afolabi. She urged Kemi to have faith that she would live more than 5 years the doctor predicted. Her post read, “May the Almighty God who healed me when they thought it was over, heal you Kemi. “May his mercy that never ends be with you now and always for what God cannot do does not exist. Have faith, my dear.” Recall that Ngozi, in 2012, was diagnosed with kidney disease which affected her acting carer.
