Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has said that “ancestors” in the All Progressives Congress, APC, are the ones now seeking to become Nigeria’s president in 2023. The Governor said this yesterday when he hosted the trio of former Senate President, Bukola Saraki; Governors Aminu Tambuwal and Bala Mohammed of Sokoto and Bauchi states. Ortom stated that any presidential candidate above 70 seeking to rule Nigeria is evil and intends on ruining the country. He appealed to Nigerians to allow young men from the PDP to rule in 2023. The governor said: “Look at these young men and compare them to the ancestors in APC that are seeking to be president of this country in a digital world. “We should allow the young to grow. If I may quote one of my brother Governors, anybody who is above 70 years and wants to be president is an evil person who wants to ruin this country, he should desist. “That is why PDP is willing and ready to rescue Nigeria and then rebuild it.”
