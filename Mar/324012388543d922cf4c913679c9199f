Nigeria is facing sanctions from FIFA and the Confederation of African Football (CAF), after thousands of fans invaded the Moshood Abiola National Stadium pitch, following a 1-1 draw with Ghana on Tuesday. The result meant the Super Eagles failed to qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The angry supporters attacked Ghanaian players and fans, destroying properties and equipment in protest. The substitute benches were smashed by the fans, who called for the removal of Amaju Pinnick, the President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). “Pinnick must go! Pinnick must go!!” the mob demanded, while some criticised Eagles’ coach, Augustine Eguavoen. The Police were forced to fire several rounds of tear gas to disperse the angry crowd. FIFA and CAF frown at violence and crowd trouble in stadiums and might fine Nigeria or impose a stadium ban.
