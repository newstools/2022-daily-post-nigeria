Nigerian music legend, Tuface Idibia has queried the Federal Government over the recovered loot of former military ruler, Sani Abacha. DAILY POST recalls that the Federal Government on April 4, 2020, recovered over $311 million of the alleged stolen funds by Abacha from the United States and Jersey. In December 2017, Switzerland also repatriated $322 million in Abacha loot to the country as part of an agreement between the two countries in 2004 during Olusegun Obasanjo’s regime. Also, on August 14 2020, the Republic of Ireland agreed to return about N2,514,651,800 (€5.5 million) stolen by Sani Abacha to Nigeria. Tuface in an Instagram post opined that Abacha may have looted the funds to protect the money from ‘thieves’ in Nigeria rather. He said this as he wondered what has become of the recovered loot. The entertainer stressed that if Abacha had the genuine intent of stealing funds, it would have been almost impossible for anyone to recover the stolen funds. Tuface wrote, “If to say Abacha actually thief this money we for no fit recover am, abi na only me they think this thing. “My guy, that your eye go sharp! I think he (Abacha) tried to keep it away from this thieving hands(my personal opinion) if not please tell me what has become of the recovered funds? Alooter continua abi.” He also used the opportunity to admonish Nigerians to wake up, stressing that no one would rescue us from the hands of shameless Nigerian leaders. “Oh shameless Nigerian and African leaders!! I definitely know that you guys will still ignore and pretend you are not aware of things. ” We, the “shameless citizens of Africa” should also wake up nobody is coming to rescue us,” Tuface wrote.
