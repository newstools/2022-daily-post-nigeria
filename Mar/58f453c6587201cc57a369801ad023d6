A female governorship hopeful in Cross River State, Mrs Nkoyo Toyo has made public her intentions to run for governor. Explained why she stepped into the fray for next year’s governorship race, Nkoyo said the state needs redemption and liberation. She gave the explanation in Ogoja when she consulted the PDP chairmen of Cross River North about her intentions. “I am throwing my hat into the ring so that God can use me to liberate our state from the current shackles it bears. “That is why I came to present myself to you as party leaders, in the local government areas. “In doing that, I have made a personal decision, that I will not use violence to win an election. It is a personal decision I have made for myself. I have never engaged in the use of violence and I will not do that” Welcoming the former governorship hopeful who is Nigeria’s former ambassador to Ethiopia, the chairman of PDP chairmen in the region, Mr. Emmanuel Odidi assured her of their support.
