A clash between cult groups at Seme border has claimed the life of a teenager, Lateef Agboola. Agboola, a student of Sito Grammar School, was macheted before being shot on Friday at Zongo in Seme border near Badagry, Lagos. NAN reports that the 19-year-old, who allegedly belonged to Eiye Confraternity, was killed during reprisal attacks. The gangs involved were Eiye and Aiye Confraternities. Adam Sule-Ayeni, an Aiye member, was earlier arrested after the death of Umar Isah. The case has been transferred to State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID), Panti, Lagos for investigation. “The killing of Agboola was done to avenge the death of Isah who was allegedly killed by the other cult group. “The deceased was sent on an errand by his mother around 8 p.m. on Friday when he was cornered and macheted”, a source said. Locals say the situation has generated fear among residents who are feeling unsafe due to the recurring killings.
