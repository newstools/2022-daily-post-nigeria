Pearl Chidinma Ogbolu, the Erelu Okin of Orile Kemta, whose party in Lagos witnessed petrol souvenir, has spoken on the controversy. Kegs of fuel bearing ‘Erelu Okin Foundation Installation Party’ stickers were shared at the ceremony. The footage triggered anger that got the authorities’ attention. Many complained that risks and the pains of Nigerians suffering fuel scarcity were ignored. Popular Fuji artiste, Malaika performed at the high-profile ceremony attended by many socialites. Ogbolu, in an Instagram post, apologized for the “momentarily indiscretion of bringing fuel into the hall”. The Erelu explained that the intention was to show appreciation to guests “for turning up at my event at these hard times”. “I have paused to reflect and truly apologise and I thank you all for your understanding and criticisms”, she wrote. On Saturday, the Lagos government sealed Havilah Events Centre in Oniru for contravening public safety rules. A joint team of the Lagos Safety Commission and the Police Rapid Response Squad (RRS) carried out the operation. Commissioner of Police, Abiodun Alabi has ordered the arrest of all culprits involved.
