Nigeria international, Kelechi Iheanacho, has said that three football legends, Ronaldinho, Sergio Aguero and Jamie Vardy inspired his football career. Iheanacho said he loves watching them and learned a lot from the trio. The Leicester City star said this while speaking to FIFA’s official website ahead of Nigeria’s 2022 FIFA World Cup playoff against Ghana on Friday night. “Growing up, I loved Ronaldinho,” Iheanacho said. “I loved his style of play, confidence, and the way he loved football. The way he dribbled, the way he played, passed his touches. He is one of the greatest players of all time. “They [Sergio Aguero and Jamie Vardy] are two legends,” Iheanacho added. “It was a really big pleasure to play alongside Kun. He is a legend and I learnt a lot from him. “And ‘Vards’ is another legend. He is one of the best finishers you will see and I have learnt a lot from him too.”
