Bauchi State Police Commissioner CP Umar Mamman Sanda has vowed to smoke out all criminal merchants desperate to make a living at the expense of law-abiding citizens across the state. The CP made the promise in a press release made available to journalists in Bauchi. He said the Command is working towards bringing an end to criminals and banditry in affected areas in the state. The CP also directed all Area Commanders and Divisional Police Officers (DPOs) to dominate their area of responsibility (AOR) and ensure that innocent and law-abiding citizens are not harassed, intimidated or molested.
