Talks with the board of directors have reinforced the idea that we are ambitious and look to create something special in the long term. I am excited for the task in hand at PSV,” Van Nistelrooy said in a PSV statement. Van Nistelrooy, who retired from playing in 2012, scored 35 goals in 70 appearances for the Netherlands.
