Former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has advised interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, to drop captain Harry Maguire ahead of their next Premier League tie with Tottenham Hotspur this weekend. Berbatov, who wants Rangnick to rest Maguire, said this while reacting to Manchester United’s latest defeat against Manchester City in a Premier League derby. Recall that Man City thrashed Man United 4-1 at the Etihad Stadium last weekend. But Berbatov said he was saddened by Man United’s display against Pep Guardiola’s side, adding that it was ‘unacceptable.’ “I was angered and saddened by United’s performance against City,” Berbatov told Betfair. “It was unacceptable. He added: “Harry Maguire can perform better. He knows that. The mistakes he’s making are damaging his ability to lead the team. He needs to correct his positioning and work on his decision-making. “Ralf Rangnick can step in here. Maybe he needs to give Maguire a rest and give somebody else a chance.”
