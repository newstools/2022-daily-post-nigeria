Popular Nigerian activist, Deji Adeyanju has claimed that the 2023 presidential ticket for the All Progressives Congress, APC will go to the South-South. Adeyanju made the claim on Thursday on his Twitter page. Alongside the picture of Rotimi Amaechi and Godwin Emefiele, Adeyanju said the APC is considering giving its presidential ticket to an Igbo candidate. Adeyanju claimed sources in the APC told him that the camp of Asiwaju Tinubu and Yemi Osinbajo will be denied the presidential ticket for 2023. The tweet read: “APC presidential ticket is likely to go to the South-South and the advantage and both have is that they are considered to be Igbo men. “South West will not get it according to many sources in APC. The ThiefNubu and Osinbajo camp will weep and cry and you heard it here first.” Adeyanju added that former President Goodluck Jonathan has a greater chance of securing the presidential ticket than Tinubu. “They are going to show ThiefNubu’ Tinubu pepper in APC. Goodluck Jonathan has more chances of getting an APC ticket than him,” he tweeted. Recall that Governor Nasir El Rufai of Kaduna State had mentioned that the APC presidential candidate will be from the Southern region. The Governor said it was left for the southern caucus of APC to decide which part of the area the presidential candidate will come from. The APC national convention is slated for March 26th.
