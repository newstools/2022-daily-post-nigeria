Governor Godwin Obaseki has told those who are not comfortable with the Edo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to leave the party immediately. Obaseki’s deputy, Phillip Shaibu had complained that the party they joined in September 2019 when they were forced out of the APC, is not treating them well and has refused to accept them. But Governor Obaseki said instead of him leaving the party, those he met there when he joined in 2019 should go elsewhere if they are not happy, adding that as his name empties, he would continue to win. “Anybody that cannot accept my leadership of PDP in Edo State will leave PDP for us. It’s as simple as that and we don’t like to boast, we don’t talk too much but you know where we are coming from,” Obasseki said while addressing party stakeholders in Benin City on Monday “And whoever is backing any group outside Edo State, I’m pleading, leave Edo alone. Leave Edo alone. Edo is not like any other State. “Edo is Edo. I told you during our Christmas gathering that I’m not going to do anything or commit to anything without sitting with each and every one of you…that I’ll not shut the door behind you. “So whatever it is, let’s all come as one family, sit down and have a conversation and let’s agree where we want to go. They’ve tried all sorts and I said ‘look, we’re battle tested but we’re not battle weary.’ “So, let people know that nobody has a monopoly of fighting. Fighting is not good. It’s not the way we want to go. To win an election, we need everybody to come together and work together. I had come to join PDP from APC. My name is Godwin and I will always win,” he added.
