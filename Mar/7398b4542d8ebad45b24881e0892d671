The All Progressive Congress (APC) stakeholders in Abia State have dragged the national leadership of the party to court over a list of delegates to Saturday’s National Convention submitted by a faction of the party in the state. The stakeholders led by Mr Ibe Ogwuma in a suit no: FCT /HC/CV/1012/2022 demanded for the dissolution of the purported Congresses conducted by Chief Ikechi Emenike-led faction ahead of Saturday’s exercise. The stakeholders approached an Abuja High Court, demanding the disqualification of the Emenike-led faction. The stakeholders prayed for an order mandating the National Caretaker Committee of APC led by Governor Mai Mala Buni to install a caretaker committee in the Abia State branch as recommended by an APC reconciliation committee. The stakeholders also prayed for an order restraining Chief Kingsley Ononugbu from parading himself as the state Chairman of APC in the state. The stakeholders also joined Chief Friday Nwosu and Ikenna Anyalewachi in the originating summons as respondents. They argued that the duo lacked the powers to validly produce and present a list of delegates to the National Convention of the party on behalf of the state chapter of the party. The stakeholders also prayed for an order directing the APC not to associate, discuss or collect any convention list or its like from Emenike and Ononugbu. In a separate suit no FCT/HC/CV M/3785/2022, Ogwuma also sought an interim injunction restraining the APC from associating, discussing or collecting any convention list or it’s like from Emenike and Ononugbo pending the determination of the substantive suit before the court. He also sought an interim order restraining Ononugbu from parading himself as the state chairman of the party on the basis that he is a product of a kangaroo congress.
