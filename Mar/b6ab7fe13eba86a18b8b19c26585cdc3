The Young Progressive Party (YPP) on Wednesday, announced the suspension of its 16th National Working Committee meeting in honour of victims who were killed after an attack on a passenger train in Kaduna State by terrorists. This followed a motion for the indefinite suspension of the meeting moved by the National Publicity Secretary of YPP, Comrade Egbeola Martins, and duly seconded by the National Woman Leader, Hajiya Binta Suleiman, after which the meeting was immediately adjourned by the party’s national chairman, Comrade Bishop Amakiri. The national leadership of YPP had earlier scheduled the meeting on 30th March, 2022, but was suspended over the unfortunate attack on the train passengers. In a statement forwarded to DAILY POST on Thursday, against the backdrop of the lastest nefarious attack on the innocent Nigerians, the YPP frowned at the rising rate of insecurity in Nigeria, and called on the government at all levels to brace up and map out effective and stable security archeitcture through improvement in intelligence gathering. The party leadership commiserated with families of those killed or kidnapped during the wicked attack, praying almighty God to grant the affected families the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss. DAILY POST had gathered that the bandits detonated a bomb on the rail track of the Abuja-Kaduna route and successfully immobilized the train at a point between Katari and Rijana. It was also gathered that the bandits surrounded the train, shooting sporadically. The terrorists killed some passenger and kidnapped many while some others were injured during the incident.
