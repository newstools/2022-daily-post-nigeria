Super Eagles captain, Ahmed Musa has said the 2022 FIFA World Cup could be his last tournament for Nigeria national team. Musa said this ahead of Nigeria’s 2022 World Cup second leg playoff against Ghana on Tuesday evening in Abuja. His statement is, however, hinged on Nigeria’s qualification. Musa remains Nigeria’s top scorer in the World Cup, having scored four goals. Speaking ahead of Tuesday’s clash against the Black Stars of Ghana, Musa said, “All the players, including myself, want to go to the World Cup. For me, it’s very important, because it could be my last World Cup. “I enjoyed the last two finals that I participated in; Brazil 2014 and Russia 2018.” He added, “I want to experience it again. Most of the players in the present squad have not been to the World Cup and they desire to be there. “We all know it won’t be easy. Ghana will come here to do battle, but we are ready for whatever they turn up with. I will not say more than that.”
