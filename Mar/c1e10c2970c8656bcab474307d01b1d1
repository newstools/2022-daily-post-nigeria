Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, on Saturday, said the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, is ready to reclaim its mandate from Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State. Wike said the PDP was ready to approach the Supreme Court to reclaim its mandate from Umahi. He spoke during the inauguration of the Eastern Bypass Road in Port Harcourt, the state capital. According to Wike, “If our party has done this earlier when people were leaving in the National Assembly, we won’t have had the problem we are having today. “That is one of the problems of party leadership. People cannot come out and take the bull by the horns. So, Governor Umahi, be rest assured that PDP will continue this matter down to Supreme Court. We will continue with the matter. “You carry the votes of another party and join another party. Can you transfer votes? You work hard for somebody to win the election and tomorrow, the person says I have defected. “If you have defected, leave the seat if you know it’s easy. And this will checkmate most of these political harlots who will never sit one place.” An Abuja Federal High Court had sacked Umahi and his Deputy, Kelechi Igwe. Justice Inyang Ekwo ruled that Umahi can not transfer the votes that got him into power under the PDP into the All Progressives Congress, APC. The judge had ordered INEC to stop recognizing Umahi and his Deputy and asked the PDP to send names to the electoral umpire for their replacement. The court said Umahi had forfeited his governorship when he defected from the PDP to join the ruling APC last year. But, an Ebonyi State High Court, sitting in Abakaliki, on Thursday, ordered Umahi to remain in office.
