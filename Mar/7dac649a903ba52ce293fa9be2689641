Former Aston Villa midfielder, George Boateng, has backed the Black Stars of Ghana to beat the Super Eagles of Nigeria and qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Boateng said Ghana’s technical crew have a solid plan in place to beat the Super Eagles to the World Cup ticket. The Black Stars will host Nigeria on Friday in the World Cup qualifying first-leg tie at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi. The Super Eagles will then host Ghana in the return leg four days later at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja. “It is an honour, a great privilege to be part of the technical team for the upcoming matches against Nigeria. Ghana is well placed to qualify for the World Cup in Qatar and as a team, we are putting in place a very solid plan to come out victorious,” Boateng, who is Ghana’s assistant coach, was quoted by Ghanasoccernet as saying. “I would like to ask all Ghanaians to put their weight behind the team in this crucial moment. We are Ghana, we are the Black Stars, and we are capable.”
