Manchester United star, Cristiano Ronaldo, has revealed his conversation with NFL legend Tom Brady after leading his side to beat Tottenham Hotspur 3-2 in Saturday’s Premier League tie. Ronaldo said he shared some ‘thoughts and ideas’ with Brady after having a quick chat with his fellow ‘Greatest of All Time’ following Man United’s victory against Spurs. Brady was at Old Trafford as he watched Man United defeat Tottenham, thanks to Ronaldo’s hat-trick. The seven-time Super Bowl winner, who announced his retirement last month, went down to the pitch to talk to some of Man United’s players. As Ronaldo approached him, the two ‘GOATs’ of their respective sports embraced and Brady said: ‘Great game. Good playing. You played great!’ Ronaldo also presented Brady with his match shirt and while many of United’s players only got a quick handshake and photo, Ronaldo shared a lengthy chat with the 44-year-old, who is the oldest player ever to be named Super Bowl MVP. “Always a pleasure and a privilege to share some thoughts and ideas with another GOAT,” Ronaldo wrote on Instagram, also uploading a picture of the two. Ronaldo will now hope to lead Man United to victory when they face Atletico Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday.
