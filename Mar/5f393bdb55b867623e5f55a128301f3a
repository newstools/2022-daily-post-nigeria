The family of an Israeli diamond magnate, ‘Leviev family’ is suing Simon Leviev, the subject of Netflix’s documentary “The Tinder Swindler,” for using its name to scam several women of millions. In a lawsuit filed in Tel Aviv Magistrate’s Court in Israel, the real Leviev family accused Simon Leviev, whose real name is Shimon Hayut of “making false representations as being the son of Lev Leviev and receiving numerous benefits claiming to be a member of the Leviev Family. The Leviev family noted that Simon will pay and bear the costs of his benefits. In the documentary ‘Tinder Swindler’, Simon Leviev who claimed he was the son of a wealthy tycoon, took women out on extravagant dates and started relationships with them before he eventually scammed them out of large sums of money. Guy Ophir, the Leviev family’s attorney, confirming the lawsuit in a statement on Monday, said that the legal action was “only the beginning of a number of lawsuits.” He said, “In the next phase, we will file a monetary suit against Simon and any other affiliate that will work with him, including some websites that have Joint ventures with Simon and/or have offered to buy cameos from him. “Anyone that also tries to capitalize from this scheme will be sued.” Chagit Leviev, the daughter of Lev Leviev, in a statement to NBC News, said the lawsuit was the first step by the family to ensure that Simon faced justice and received the sentence he deserves. “Simon Hayut is a fraud who stole our family’s identity and used it to exploit our good name to con victims out of millions of dollars. “He has no relation to the Leviev family and has no affiliation with our company LLD Diamonds,” she said. Chagit expressed hope that this will bring an end to his actions as his real identity has been exposed. Simon has also been banned from dating apps like Tinder and Hinge after the release of “The Tinder Swindler.”
