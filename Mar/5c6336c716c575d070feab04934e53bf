The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, JAMB, on Thursday, said it has, so far, registered over 500,000 candidates for the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME). This was disclosed by JAMB Registrar, Prof Ishaq Oloyede, while monitoring the registration exercise in Bwari Area Council Abuja, on Thursday. According to him, the board’s target is to register at least 1.5 million candidates before the March 26, 2022 deadline. He said, “So far so good, we have registered over five hundred candidates. We are expecting about 1.5 million or thereabout. We still have more than twelve days to go. And if things continue to move smoothly, we plan to register 50 thousand per day. Two days ago, it was over seventy thousand per day. We believe today we should be able to register seventy thousand. Yesterday there was a little glitch on the system. On the quality of CBT test already administered by the board, he said, “which of the biometric centres are they using that is as good as this one you have seen here? And yet we do it at N3,500 yet people are still not complying with simple instruction. You can see that everything is going on well. “Even outside Nigeria, West African College of Physicians and West African College of Surgeons, people from outside the country are coming here to patronise us because we are doing the right thing for them. So, if the quality of work is not good, they wouldn’t be coming from all over”.
