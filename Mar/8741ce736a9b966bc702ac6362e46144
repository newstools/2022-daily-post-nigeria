The United States has designated six Nigerians as sponsors of the terrorist group Boko months after their convictions in the UAE. The U.S. Department of State made the disclosure via a statement on Friday. It announced that the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) added the citizens to the terror-support list. They are Abdurrahman Ado Musa, Salihu Yusuf Adamu, Bashir Ali Yusuf, Muhammed Ibrahim Isa, Ibrahim Ali Alhassan, and Surajo Abubakar Muhammad. They are now Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, pursuant to Executive Order 13224, as amended. They were indicted for “having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, Boko Haram”. The American government said the action follows the United Arab Emirates’ prosecutions, convictions, and designations of the individuals for supporting terrorism. The Department of State designated Boko Haram as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and Specially Designated Global Terrorist organization on November 14, 2013. The sect has murdered thousands and carried out attacks in the Northern and Northeastern regions of Nigeria. Boko Haram has also severally attacked the Lake Chad Basin in Cameroon, Chad and Niger since 2009.
