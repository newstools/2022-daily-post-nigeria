Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has alleged that the Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni had perfected moves to create a crisis for the All Progressives Party, APC, ahead of the party’s March 26 national convention. Akeredolu, who frowned at the role of Buni while he held sway as the APC’s Chairman of the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, CECPC, stated that the Yobe State Governor had alongside few of his colleagues, whom he referred as ‘yahoo yahoo’ governors plotted to frustrate the convention from holding. The governor in a statement he personally signed on Thursday, said that President Muhammadu Buhari’s and majority of the governors’ quick action to save the party from “internal scavengers” was a tremendous move in avoiding the party from falling off the cliff. Abubakar Sani Bello, the Governor of Niger State, became the acting chairman of the party two days ago, following reports that the Buni-led CECPC was planning to sabotage the party’s next national convention. While assuring Bello of the support of the majority of APC governors in organizing a successful national convention for the party, Akeredolu stated that despite the bungled efforts of those opposed to a hitch-free convention, the APC will remain great. The statement partly read “We, the Governors are for the party except for the few “Yahoo, Yahoo” Governors (apologies to Salihu, former DG of the Progressive Governors’ Forum) who were hand in glove with Buni to circumvent the will of majority of our Party (APC) members. “Progressive Governors in the true name, mostly all of us, are determined to see our Party through these patchy parts at all cost. None of the scanty number has the guts to carry out their imaginary threats as reported in sponsored stories. We dare them to leave the party.”
