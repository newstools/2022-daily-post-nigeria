A man in Adamawa State, Abdullahi Yakubu, has been convicted and sentenced to three years imprisonment for parading himself as a Police Inspector and exacting his false authority on people. The man who became known by unwary members of the public as Inspector Ibrahim was handed a 3-year prison term for the offence of impersonation. The sentence, however, came with N100,000 option of fine. The convict who hails from Garkida in Gombi LGA of Adamawa claimed to be an inspector attached to D4 of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the Police headquarters in Yola. The end began came for him when he arrived at the Jimeta ultra-modern market in Yola sometime last month, met a businessman identified as Shafiu Salisu and introduced himself as Inspector Ibrahim, DAILY POST gathered He told Shafiu that he was assigned to look for the Chairman of Gold and Jewelries sellers and that he should be directed to his office. Shafiu was said to have told him that the chairman was not in the market but referred him to the vice-chairman of the union at the Jimeta Shopping complex, also in Yola Last week, on March 17, ‘Inspector’ Ibrahim met Shafiu again and, apparently not recognising him, introduced himself as a Police inspector. He told Shafiu that he was on assignment and needed some money to execute it. Suspicious of the man now, Shafiu was said to have made some enquiries and came up with the conclusion that Ibrahim was not what he claimed to be. Shafiu reported him and he was arrested by the police, to whom he confessed during investigation that he was not a police officer. He was subsequently arraigned before the Chief Magistrate court 1 in Yola, which on Tuesday sentenced him to three years in prison with an option to pay a fine of N100,000.
