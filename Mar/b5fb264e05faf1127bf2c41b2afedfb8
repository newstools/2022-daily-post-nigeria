Yomi Alliyu, Counsel to the Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Igboho, on Tuesday, debunked reports that Noble Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka was part of the team that secured the release of the activist. Alliyu said Professor Wale Adediran, a member of the Ilana Ono Oodua, IOO, was the one actively involved in the negotiation that led to Sunday Igboho’s release. Igboho has been in the custody of the Beninese Government since July 19, 2021. Alliyu said: “Prof Wale Adeniran was actively involved in Sunday Igboho’s release. Prof Wole Soyinka had nothing to do with the release of Chief Sunday Adeyemo, a.k.a Igboho.” He also mentioned that Igboho is hale and hearty. “We’ll ever commend the immense contributions of Prof Wale Adeniran for the laudable role he played in negotiating the conditional release of our client,” Aliiyu said.
