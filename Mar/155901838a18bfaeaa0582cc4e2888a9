The battle for the soul of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) appears to have been shifted to London, the United Kingdom, as President Muhammad Buhari will meet with the embattled Chairman of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni. DAILY POST gathered that the London meeting, according to a source, will also include the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN). Malami, who had earlier advised the APC against moving to drop Buni as Chairman, has already arrived in London, Friday night, the source confirmed. Buni, on the other side, was billed to travel back to Nigeria Wednesday night from Dubai, the United Arab Emirate, but changed his mind and jetted to the UK, where Buhari is currently enjoying his two weeks medical leave, to explain his own side of the story. Another source also confirmed that the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, will be meeting Buhari. It was not confirmed, as at press time, if Emefiele would be meeting Buhari jointly with the duo of Buni and Malami, or in relation to the recent rumour of his presidential ambition. But another source said “Emefiele is in London to brief President Buhari on the current state of Nigeria’s economy”. With the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) calling the APC to order on the “illegal” change of guard at the national secretariat of the party, the London meeting appears to bring soft landing for the broom party in the 2023 general elections.
