In his speech at the state congress of the party in Ilorin on Saturday, Ogunbayo appealed to the new executive who were all elected through consensus arrangement to work as a team for the realisation of the desired result in 2023 elections. “It is important to remind all of us that we are in a race that must be won. Let us work with all we have and make sure the party wins 2023 elections. “I need to plead to all that we must not hold grudges against one another, we must work as a team and I am pretty sure, success and glory will be ours,” he asserted. The new party chairman, urged his executive members elected from various Senatorial Districts of the state to be up and doing and work as one family. ” We must all serve as examples to other members of the party. Let these be our watchwords.” Ogunbayo, promised not to derail from the principles that have been followed to pilot the affairs of the party, adding that ” I will equally use my wealth of experience and wisdom to uplift the party to greater heights.” He described the Congresses at the wards, local governments and state levels all through consensus as successful and hitch free . In his own speech, the outgoing chairman of the party, Mr Charles Afolayan, said he is handing over the party with over 60,000 members to the new executives of the party in the state. According to Charles, ” YPP has changed the political narrative of politics in the state and will remain committed to good governance, accountability and service to the people.”
