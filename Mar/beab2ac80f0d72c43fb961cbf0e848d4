Arsenal legend, Thierry Henry has slammed Paris Saint-Germain fans for booing their forward, Lionel Messi. Recall that Messi and his teammate, Neymar, were jeered by their own fans during their home game against FC Bordeaux a few days ago. The supporters expressed their frustration following PSG’s exit from the UEFA Champions League at the hands of Real Madrid during the 3-0 win against Bordeaux in Ligue 1. Messi missed PSG’s 3-0 defeat to Monaco on Sunday due to illness and perhaps his absence was felt by Mauricio Pochettino’s side on the pitch. And Henry said that PSG created nothing in the absence of Messi. “Last week, PSG fans booed Messi. How can you boo the greatest of all-time? The guy that has assisted the most goals in Ligue 1 (this season)? Today, without Messi, the team created nothing,” Henry said, as quoted by The Mirror.
