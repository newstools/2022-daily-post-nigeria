Chelsea midfielder, Mateo Kovacic, has thanked Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich for his impact at the club after his latest decision to put the Blues up for sale. The Russian billionaire had last week confirmed he would be putting Chelsea up for sale. The 55-year-old insisted that it would be in the ‘best interest of the Club, the fans, the employees, as well as the Club’s sponsors and partners’, amid calls for the UK government to sanction him following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Speaking to Chelsea’s Fifth Stand app, Kovacic opened up on the sale and sent a message to Abramovich. The Croatia international said, “Obviously, it is big news,” he said. “We don’t know what to say, really. The owner, I came here at his time. I am so thankful for everything he’s given this club, the club won so many trophies under him and grew so much in the world. “Chelsea is now a huge club thanks to him. It’s a big thanks. Now we will see what is going to happen.”
