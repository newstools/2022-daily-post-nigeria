There is confusion presently among indigenes and residents of Ibadan, Oyo State over the promotion of two Mogajis as Jagun Balogun of Ibadan land. DAILY POST gathered that the title of Mogaji is synonymous with a family head. Each Mogaji who wished to become the Olubadan is promoted to either Jagun Balogun or Jagun Olubadan and from there, move from one step to the other to become Olubadan. Our correspondent, however, gathered on Tuesday that two separate letters have been issued to two Mogajis from two different families to become Jagun Balogun. The title of Jagun Balogun is meant for one person, but two people have been issued letters of appointment, the development which is causing serious confusion in the ancient city. Our correspondent gathered that Chief Remi Ibrahim Babalola and Dotun Sanusi have been issued letters of appointment as Jagun Balogun of Ibadanland. The situation is currently causing confusion among the indigenes and residents. The two letters obtained by DAILY POST on Tuesday had sparked heated arguments. DAILY POST gathered that the letter issued to Dotun Sanusi was signed by the Secretary of the Olubadan Advisory Council. Sanusi is currently the Mojaji of the Olugbade family in Oja’ba area of Ibadan. Our correspondent, however, gathered that the letter issued to Remi Ibrahim Babalola was personally signed by Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Lekan Balogun. Babalola is currently the Mogaji of Ogidi compound, Ajegede in Oke Ofa Atipe area of Ibadan. However, one of the sources close to the Olubadan palace said the two letters would soon be withdrawn. “They will withdraw the two letters. Three letters have been issued, one of them do not have controversy, but the two that have controversy will be withdrawn along with the third one”. Another close personality to the Olubadan described the development as ‘administrative’ lapses. “It is an administrative lapse. The Olubadan will soon speak on the matter”.
