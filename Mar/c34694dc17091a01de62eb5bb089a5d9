A police officer, identified as Sergeant Bello, has reportedly killed at least six mobile police officers and injured others in Maiduguri, Borno State capital. According to Daily Trust, the incident occurred inside the police college quarters of Borno Police headquarters in Maiduguri. It was learnt that the errant officer is currently being detained at the State Criminal Investigation Department, SCID as efforts to unravel the cause continue. Reports revealed that Sergent Bello, prior to the incident, had domestic issues with his wife which led to misunderstandings with other officers. Efforts by DAILY POST to reach the command for comment, proved abortive as at press time as the State Police Public Relations Officer’s number could not be reached.
