Former Crystal Palace striker, Clinton Morrison has criticized Leicester City manager, Brendan Rodgers’ decision to bench Super Eagles stars, Wilfred Ndidi and Ademola Lookman in his side’s starting lineup against Arsenal. Rodgers did not start Ndidi and Lookman as Arsenal defeated Leicester City at Emirates on Sunday, in a Premier League tie, thanks to goals from Thomas Partey and Alexandre Lacazette. Ndidi eventually replaced Nampalys Mendy in the second half, while Lookman was an unused substitute. The result against Arsenal means Leicester City are now in 12th position on the Premier League table with 33 points from 26 matches. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Morrison said he knew Arsenal would win the match after seeing that Ndidi, Lookman, Youri Tielemans and Patson Daka were not included in Leicester’s starting XI against Arsenal. He said: “I knew it would be an Arsenal win with that team sheet. When I saw no Wilfred Ndidi, no Youri Tielemans, no Patson Daka and also no Ademola Lookman, who I think has been good for them recently, I just thought there would not be enough attacking threat to cause Arsenal problems.” Leicester City’s next match is against Rennes in the Europa Conference League on Thursday.
