The Nigeria Police has dismissed two Inspectors serving in Borno for alleged unprofessional conduct. The dismissed Inspectors, Tahir Ali, and Saidu Nadabo are both attached to the 53 Force Mobile Unit, Borno. The Commissioner of Police (CP) in charge of Borno, Mr Abdu Umar said this to NAN in Maiduguri on Thursday. Umar said while Ali was dismissed for allegedly killing an Army Warrant Officer Donatus Vokong, attached to Operation Hadin Kai, Nadabo was dismissed for trafficking 4.5kg cannabis sativa. The CP said that Ali allegedly shot and killed the warrant officer with his rifle under the influence of alcohol on Feb. 2. Umar said both the suspect and deceased were attached to a unit at the palace of a traditional ruler in Maiduguri. According to him, the Assistant Inspector-General of Police (AIG) in charge of Zone 12, Mr Audu Madaki, approved that Ali and Nadabo be dismissed after they faced an orderly room trial. He said that Nadabo was dismissed after being arrested by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) with a 4.5kg substance suspected to be cannabis sativa. Umar vowed that any operative in the state found to have breached the code of conduct and rules of engagement and standard operating procedure would be dealt with accordingly. “I have just directed senior officers of the command to arrest any personnel with riffle and is under the influence of alcohol or who engage in gross misconduct,’’ he said.
