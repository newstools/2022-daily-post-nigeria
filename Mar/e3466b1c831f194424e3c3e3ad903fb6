Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, has hit back at Russia’s claim that Ukraine is preparing a chemical attack. Zelensky, in a video message posted on Facebook Thursday, said no chemical weapon or weapons of mass destruction were developed in Ukraine. Russia had accused Ukraine of developing biological weapons and preparing a chemical attack but Zelensky said this made him “really worried.” “We’ve been repeatedly convinced; If you want to know Russia’s plans, look at what Russia accuses others of,” he said.
“We are accused of attacks on allegedly peaceful Russia. “And now what? … What else have you prepared for us? Where will you strike with chemical weapons?” Zelensky asked, addressing Russia. The UN Security Council will hold a meeting Friday at the request of Russia about the claim that the US is currently developing chemical weapons in Ukraine to help them exterminate Russia. According to the Office of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), more than 360 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion began. The report also said that so far, 1,123 civilians have been wounded, including 364 killed and 759 injured, OHCHR said, while acknowledging that the real figures are likely “considerably higher.”
