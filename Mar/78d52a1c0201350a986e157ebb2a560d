Incoming Manchester United boss, Erik ten Hag has been told he must sack three ‘trouble makers’- Cristiano Ronaldo, Paul Pogba and Harry Maguire, if he is finally announced as the next permanent manager at Old Trafford. This advice is coming from no other than Rene van der Gijp, a former Netherlands international. Ten Hag, who is currently with Ajax, has already been interviewed by United’s hierarchy at the start of the week. The interview was reported to have ended on a ‘positive’ note, with the 52-year-old detailing his philosophy and vision for the club. Other managers in United shortlist are Mauricio Pochettino of Paris Saint-Germain, Sevilla boss, Julen Lopetegui and Spain boss, Luis Enrique. Ten Hag, who is a front runner among the others, has been told he will face some considerable challenges from Ronaldo, Pogba and Maguire should he land the United job. “He just needs to get rid of those troublemakers. Ronaldo, Pogba, Maguire,” Gijp said on Vendaag Inside. Meanwhile, Daily Mail reported during the week that two clubs who competed in the Champions League this season are also interested in ten Hag.
