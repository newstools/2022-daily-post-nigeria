The New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), a political party hitherto unknown in Adamawa State, has in effect become a third force as notable politicians have embraced it. A former Deputy Governor of the state under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mohammed Chubado Tahir, and a former top player in the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr Phineas Pwanohoma Elisha are among the new interim leaders of the NNPP in Adamawa State. The two and many others who were introduced at a ceremony in Yola on Tuesday are all coming into the NNPP as products of the 3rd Force Movement midwived by former Kano State Governor, Musa Kwankwaso, among other national leaders. Sa’ad MC Tahir, otherwise known simply as MC Tahir, who was Deputy Governor to Governor Bala James Ngilari in Adamawa State, serves as the leader of the NNPC in Adamawa State and convener of the inaugural NNPP press briefing in Yola. He said he had been a member of the leading two political parties in the country: All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), and could say that they have all failed Nigerians. “These people in APC and PDP are treacherous and unfaithful politicians who have failed the country,” MC Tahir said. He said the NNPP is a true grassroots party out to give refreshing narratives to politics. The NNPP Interim Chairman in Adamawa State, PP Elisha, said the NNPP is growing fast, as in two days of the party’s membership drive through registration, it had registered over 54,000 people as members across Adamawa State. PP Elisha who was a famous right-hand man of former Governor Murtala Nyako while he was Adamawa Governor first under PDP and later under APC between 2007 and 2014, said people have been defecting to NNPP from not only APC and PDP but also from other political parties.
