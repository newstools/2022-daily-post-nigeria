The Nigerian Football Federation, NFF, has confirmed the resignation of Super Eagles Technical Adviser, Augustine Eguavoen.

Mohammed Sanusi, NFF General Secretary, disclosed this in a statement he signed and issued on Thursday. Sanusi also disclosed that the Federation withdrew the two-and-a-half year contract offered to the coaches and terminated the appointment of the entire technical crew of the team with immediate effect. He disclosed that a new crew will be announced after a proper review to lead the new charge of reinvigorating the Super Eagles to face future challenges appropriately. “We thank the coaches and team officials for their service to the nation and wish them success in their future endeavours,” he said.
