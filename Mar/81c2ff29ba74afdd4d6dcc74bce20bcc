The Ebonyi House of Assembly on Tuesday, said the judiciary cannot stop it from holding its plenary despite the political upheavals in the state. Mr Arinze Chukwu (APC- Ishielu South) the House Committee Chairman on Information made the declaration while speaking with newsmen after plenary in Abakaliki. Chukwu said the House was aware of the judgment of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja which on March 8, sacked 17 of its members from defecting from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC) and declared their seats vacant. He explained that the Assembly had appealed the judgement and will continue to serve the people of the state pending the outcome of the appeal. “We have appealed the judgment and until it is determined, we are not barred from holding plenary. “No court, therefore, stops us from holding plenary and we will continue to serve our people,” he said.
