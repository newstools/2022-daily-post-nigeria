President Muhammadu Buhari is currently meeting with security chiefs a few hours after Monday night’s terrorist attack on Abuja-Kaduna bound train by bandits. DAILY POST had reported that the train was conveying about 950 passengers from Abuja to Kaduna at about 7.45pm when the attack happened. The Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt.-Gen.
