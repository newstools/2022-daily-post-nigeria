The Adamawa State Independent Electoral Commission (ADSIEC) has fixed next week for the screening of nominees for local government chairmen and vice-chairmen. The scheduled screening is part of activities towards the local government election fixed for April 9, 2022. The election is for Adamawa people to choose chairmen and councillors for the 21 local government areas of the state. The screening timetable released by ADSIEC Chairman, Alhaji Isa Shettima, and made available to newsmen by Information Officer, Innocent Daniel, said the exercise will commence on Monday, the 14th of March, 2022. According to the commission, chairmen and vice-chairmen from Northern/Central Senatorial Zone A comprising Madagali, Michika, Mubi South, Mubi North, Maiha, Hong, Gombi, Song, Girei and Fufore are to be screened on Monday and Tuesday. The Southern Senatorial Zone B which has Toungo, Ganye, Jada, Mayo Belwa, Muman, Demsa, Lamurde, Guyuk, Shelleng, Yola North, and Yola South are expected to be screened on the 14th and 15th March, respectively. The proposed April 9 local council election was initially planned for December 4, 2021, but ADSIEC postponed it, citing inadequate resources. The state government responded by appointing caretaker officials that now run the councils after the tenure of elected chairmen and councillors ended that month, December 7, 2021.
