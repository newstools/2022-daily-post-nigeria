Abdulmajid Danbilki Kwamanda, a strong supporter and associate of President Muhammadu Buhari, has been arraigned before a Senior Magistrate Court at Normansland Kano State. Kwamanda was arraigned before Senior Magistrate Aminu Gabari for allegedly defaming the character of Kano State Governor, Umar Abdullahi Ganduje. Alwan Hassan Naif, an aide to Vice President Yemi Osibanjo, had during an interview last week accused the APC caretaker Convention Committee Chairman and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni of collecting bribe from Governor Ganduje to issue Certificate of Returned to the state party chairman, Abdullahi Abbas. To this, Danbilki Kwamanda went on a local radio station in Kano, accusing Governor Ganduje of giving Buni bribe to get Certificate of Return to Abbas. He was arrested after the interview. Although Kwamanda denied the allegations on the basis that he only aired his views on what Osinbajo’s aide said, he was still docked before the Magistrate Court.
