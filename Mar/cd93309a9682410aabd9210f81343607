Two siblings ignited during a kerosene explosion in Obubra LGA of Cross River State have been severely burned, DAILY POST reports. Their father, Mr Washington Udoh, a priest, said the incident happened last week in the evening in a church compound where he escaped with them to hide following the communal clash between Ochon people which had claimed lives. He said the kerosene was bought from a boy who hawked the adulterated product for a guardian. “We have tried to locate the hawker and his guardian in vain. I was not present when the incident happened but neighbours had to rescue my children who are 11 and 13 on my behalf. I thought the church was safer when I escaped from the deadly communal clash. “The burn was severe. They have been in the General Hospital in Obubra where they are receiving treatment. Appealing for financial support from the public being a full-time priest, Udoh informed that doctors are considering asking him to take his children home because of the high cost of treatment. He also appealed to the government to look into the incessant incidents of kerosene fire caused by adulteration of petroleum products in Cross River State.
