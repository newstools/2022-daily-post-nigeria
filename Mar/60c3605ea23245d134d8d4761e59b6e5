Ghana will be without their captain Andre Ayew and forward, Benjamin Tetteh when they take on Nigeria in the 2022 World Cup playoffs this month. Ayew and Tetteh will miss the two games due to suspension. The Black Stars have delayed naming their squad for the playoffs, while the Super Eagles have released a 25-man squad and an additional seven players on standby. For Ghana, there also remains doubt over the availability of Kamaldeen Sulemana, which is why Otto Addo is not in a rush to release his squad. However, Mohammed Kudus is expected to return after missing the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations due to injury. Daniel Amartey, Thomas Partey and Jordan Ayew have been communicating with Addo, as a lot will depend on the trio for the doubleheader. The Black Stars will host the Super Eagles on Friday, March 25, 2022, at the Cape Coast stadium before travelling to Abuja for the second leg in four days’ time.
