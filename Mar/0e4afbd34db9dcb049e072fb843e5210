The Speaker, Cross River House of Assembly, Mr Eteng Jonah-Williams, has reacted to court order, which sacked him and 19 other lawmakers in the state. DAILY POST had reported that a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja had sacked William and 19 others for defecting to the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC. The lawmakers were members of PDP before their defection. Justice Taiwo Taiwo had dismissed the defence argument that PDP (plaintiff) had no locus standi to institute the case. Speaking to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday, Williams said that he is not aware of any court judgment sacking him or any member of the house. According to him, the affected lawmakers have not been served with any court order. “As far as I am concerned, I am not aware of any court judgment sacking me or any member because we have not been served with any court order as we speak,” he said. Meanwhile, Mr Francis Ovat (PDP), representing Obubra 2 State Constituency, has hailed the judgment as sound. Ovat said Jumping from one party to the other kills democracy and the judgment is a good one. He stressed that elected officials should learn to stay in one party and resolve their issues if there is a crisis in their party.
