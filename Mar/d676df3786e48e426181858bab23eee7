The Director General of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Major General Shaibu Ibrahim, has called on the 2022 Batch A Stream II Corps members to strive towards skill acquisition and entrepreneurship training by keying into the NYSC Skill Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Development Program (SAED) as white-collar jobs are no longer available or fashionable. According to the DG, through programmes such as SAED, corps members can acquire skills that will sustain them in their future endeavors after completing their one year mandatory service to the nation. Ibrahim also urged the corps members to be obedient to camp rules and regulations. He reminded the corps members that they were not only representing themselves but also their parents as well as their various institutions of learning. He warned that anyone found disobeying camp rules would be dealt with in accordance with the NYSC Bye Laws. The NYSC DG made the call at the swearing-in program of the corps members in Katsina state. The DG who was represented by the NYSC State Coordinator, Alhaji Alhidjo Yahaya, in his address also emphasized on the need for Corps members to learn at least a trade before leaving the orientation Camp. He admonished the corps members to take the NYSC SAED in-camp training seriously. The DG also drew the attention of corps members to the existence of COVID-19 pandemic, urging all corps members to take the vaccine and adhere strictly to the COVID-19 safety protocols. Ibrahim also warned corps members to desist from using the social media to promote negative and social vices, urging them to instead use it to promote national unity and integration.
