An Independent Investigation Panel, on Friday, ordered retired Brig.-Gen. Buba Marwa, the Chairman, National Drug Laws Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), to produce suspended DCP, Abba Kyari, on March 22, 2022. The panel also ordered the new Commandant of the IGP-IRT, Tunde Dirsu, to do the needful to make sure that Kyari is produced before the panel on the aforesaid date. The panel is investigating allegations of human rights violations by the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) and other Units of the Nigeria Police. Mr John Martins, representing the Chairman of the panel, retired Justice Suleiman Galadima, explained that the presence of Kyari before the panel was necessary owing to the fact that a petitioner’s witness had earlier mentioned him. He said, “The witness testified that Kyari allegedly promised to reach out to him in respect of the missing persons and to date, nothing was heard about them. “The above orders are made in respect of three persons who were allegedly arrested and detained by the IGP-IRT detention facility. ”The whereabouts of Yakubu Danjuma, Ibrahim Daniel and Choji Dung are still unknown.” The order of the panel followed information from Halilu Adamu, the panel’s counsel, that Kyari was in the custody of the NDLEA. James Idachaba, the Police Counsel, told the panel that the Police could no longer produce Kyari because he was no longer in Police custody, having been suspended. NAN reports that the panel had, on March 8, 2022, ordered the Office of the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) to unfailingly produce the aforementioned three victims before it. Before the panel’s order, a Federal High Court, FCT sitting in Gudu, Abuja had ordered for the release of the mentioned persons but to date the order was not carried out
