The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has reacted to a video showing former Anambra Governor Willie Obiano in custody. Obiano was arrested last Thursday after handing over to his successor Governor Charles Soludo in Awka. He was intercepted at the Murtala Muhammad International Airport (MMIA) while heading to Houston, Texas. During the weekend, footage showing him sitting, dressed in a T-shirt and matching shorts, went viral. A statement on Monday by EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren condemned the release of the video, announcing that the culprit will face the music. He said the act was “completely at variance with the established Standard Operating Procedure” of the commission. “A discreet investigation ordered upon discovery of the leak has revealed the errant officer behind the odious act. “He is currently being subjected to appropriate disciplinary action”, Uwajaren disclosed. Obiano is accused of diverting Local Government Councils (LGCs) allocations and alleged purchase of properties in Nigeria and abroad.
