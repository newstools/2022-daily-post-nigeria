Emmanuel Macham, a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain in Plateau State has said the National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu helped the party clinch the Jos North/Bassa Federal Constituency by-election. His statement on Sunday noted that Ayu’s peace meeting with retired Gen. Jerry Useini and former Governor Jonah Jang restored unity. PDP’s Musa Agah won the February 26 poll, defeating Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) candidates. The House of Representatives seat became vacant following the death of the former occupant, Haruna Maitala (APC) in 2021 Macham described Ayu as “the most credible leader to have piloted the affairs of the party in its history”. The member hailed the chairman’s willingness to listen to all sides, adding that it provided the impetus to a successful reconciliation. He recalled that after losing in 2015, the PDP got enmeshed in a massive crisis that reduced its strength in Plateau. Macham said the party kept struggling through several hurdles and dangerous disagreements created by certain individuals. Leaders became shadows of themselves and turned to worms eating PDP from within and fanning embers of disharmony, he lamented. “Sen Ayu took the bull by the horn and demonstrated uncommon leadership acumen by inviting all interest groups to a frank discussion. “All groups were convinced by his sincerity of purpose and were ready for the sacrifices that were made toward rebuilding the PDP. “That is what the party rode on to clinch the House of Representatives seat”, he said. Macham urged members to build on the newfound cohesion ahead of 2023. The statement added that though the task ahead is challenging, the PDP will bounce back to glory under Ayu’s leadership.
