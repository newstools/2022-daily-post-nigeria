British property developer, Nick Candy, is set to become Chelsea’s new owner as he is reportedly planning to launch a bid worth £2.5 billion to buy the Premier League giants from Roman Abramovich. Abramovich had already put Chelsea up for sale, insisting that it was in the best interest of the west London club. The Russian billionaire is keen to sell his assets in the UK before any sanctions are imposed following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. However, a spokesperson for Candy confirmed to Sportsmail that he is looking at various options for launching a bid, saying: “Nick Candy is actively exploring a number of options for a potential bid for Chelsea Football Club. Any bid would be made in conjunction with another party (or consortium), and we have serious interest from several international partners. “Mr. Candy has a huge affinity with Chelsea. His father was asked to play for the club, and he has been watching matches at Stamford Bridge since the age of four.” Candy and his potential partners are well aware that their valuation of Chelsea is short of Abramovich’s asking price of £3 billion.
