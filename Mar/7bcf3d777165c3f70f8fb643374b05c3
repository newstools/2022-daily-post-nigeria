Nigeria captain, Ahmed Musa has said that coach Augustine Eguavoen will decide whether newcomers, Ademola Loomman or Akinkunmi Amoo, would start the game against Ghana ahead of him (Musa). Nigeria will travel to Kumasi to face Ghana in a 2022 World Cup playoff on Friday evening. Lookman and Amoo are in the Super Eagles camp for the first time ever after they were handed their maiden call-ups to the Super Eagles for the doubleheader against the Black Stars. Musa, who spoke to the press during Wednesday’s press conference, said, “Nigeria has a lot of talents, so no matter who is called up to the national team, he knows what he’s going to do. “The new players Amoo and Lookman, the coach will decide who is going to start or they are going to come from the bench. “Everyone is ready, there is nothing new, but when you come into a new team, you have to understand what and what not, the Nigerian spirit.”
