Progressive Youths Stakeholders (PYS) within the All Progressives Congress (APC) has urged party leaders to show courage like Ondo and Kaduna Governors, Rotimi Akeredolu and Nasiru El-Rufai. The duo has been vocal amid the leadership crisis rocking the party whose national convention will be held on March 26. PYS expressed sadness over the “acrimony, hypocrisy and bootlicking” among some chieftains in the ruling platform. A statement on Thursday by the Coordinator, Damilola Ibrahim identified the lack of selfless leaders as one of the challenges in the APC. It noted that for the party to survive after President Muhammadu Buhari leaves office, stalwarts must be ready to speak the truth at all times. “We must defend the party as an institution. In the course of doing so, you may step on toes, but the reality is that the fight for the soul of the party can never be wrong”, it reads. PYS stressed the need to jettison the caucus fraternity, denounce personal affinity and begin to act in a way that will strengthen the APC, not just the members. Ibrahim charged youths to continue to promote and expand the path of courage that certain leaders have created. He said Akeredolu and El-Rufai have displayed leadership traits that emerging leaders should emulate and imbibe. “We understand their intervention to mean that irrespective of who is involved, the ultimate loyalty is first to the party. “Once broken, it may be hard to amend, we must continue to think along the path of saving the party rather than mending the party to save friendship”, the statement added. On Thursday, the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) released the list of committees for the convention.
