Former England striker, Darren Bent, has told Manchester United to sell six top stars, Harry Maguire, Fred, Edinson Cavani, Cristiano Ronaldo, Scott McTominay and Paul Pogba, in the summer transfer window. Bent also wants Man United to keep the likes of David de Gea, Raphael Varane, Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford at Old Trafford at the end of the season. This is coming after Man United was eliminated from the Champions League at the hands of Atletico Madrid this week. Speaking on talkSPORT’s Drivetime, Bent said: “The ones you keep are [David] de Gea, you keep Varane. You need a new right-back, I think. (Harry) Maguire? Nope. “I don’t think [Scott McTominay] is good enough, but he’s your own. Building-wise? Nope. “I think Fred is a weird one because you have to say he’s been one in the last few weeks who has gone, ‘You know what? I’m up for this’. But I guess if you are trying to start against and build a successful side, he might have to go. “You keep Sancho. Ronaldo has got to go. [Edinson] Cavani has got to go. [Martial] has got to go. “Rashford is the one where, if the new manager fancies him, there is something there. If he can get that best out of him, then you keep him because he is young. “[Pogba] is going to go anyway, he is on a free at the end of the season. If Manchester United have any kind of aspirations [he should go]. “I love Pogba as a player, I really do, but Manchester United fans are becoming sick of saying, ‘we are waiting for that consistency’, so he would have to go.”
