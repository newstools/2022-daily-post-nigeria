The Minister of Transportation and foremost chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, has warned the party of making the same mistake of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. The former Rivers State Governor spoke with reporters during the APC National Convention in Abuja on Saturday where he also revealed that the other five candidates running for the party’s Chairmanship seat stepped down for Abdullahi Adamu because they felt he was the best candidate to lead the party at this point. Amaechi said the PDP, his former political party, never knew they will be in the opposition today, believing that no matter what happened they’ll be in power forever He warned that this is one big mistake APC must avoid in order not to land in the opposition too, accusing the PDP of having refused to listen to Nigerians. On why the other candidates stepped down for Adamu, Amaechi said, “They seem to have agreed that Abdullahi, I won’t say is better, but is first among equals. “They have agreed he will be the best Chairman for now that would lead the party in confronting the opposition. You know it’s good to hear that PDP is in opposition. They never knew they’ll be opposition. That’s the reality of party politics. “The APC too must be prepared to make sure we’re not In the opposition like PDP. PDP never assumed they’ll be in opposition. “They believed that no matter what happened they’ll be in power forever. And unfortunate for them, they were not listening to Nigerians. “But as a party, APC is listening, we’re hearing, we know they’re complaining and the President is addressing those complaints so that things will change.”
