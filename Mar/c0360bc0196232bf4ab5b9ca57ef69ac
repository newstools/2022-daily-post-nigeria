The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), in two years, recorded an excess of 250,000 coronavirus cases and 3,000 deaths in the country. The centre, in a statement, explained that in its bid to strengthen the health system to cope with other infectious diseases and future health emergencies, the country had learnt its lessons. It noted that 27th February marks exactly two years when the first case of coronavirus disease was detected in Nigeria. According to the NCDC, coronavirus still remained a global reality, with the risk of emergence of dangerous variants, despite the prevailing pandemic fatigue. The statement observed, “This makes it critical to learn from lessons taught by this pandemic to strengthen preparedness and response to other diseases, in line with our mandate. We have continued to face outbreaks of cholera and Lassa fever concurrently with the COVID-19 pandemic.” It said the centre was building on lessons from responding to the pandemic in the last two years to strengthen health security in the country. It said it all had the responsibility to encourage and continue to hold authorities accountable to sustain interest and investment in healthcare.
