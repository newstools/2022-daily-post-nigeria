A Catholic priest, Reverend Father Leo Raphael, along with several other travellers, has been allegedly kidnapped by armed terrorists in Sarkin Pawa, Munya Local Government Area of Niger State. It was gathered that the cleric, who is the parish priest of St Mary’s Catholic Church, Sarkin Pawa, with the others were abducted on Sunday evening on their way to Sarkin Pawa. It was learnt that the gunmen blocked the main highway unknown to travellers, who ran into them. A source told DAILY POST that a large number of terrorists were sighted on motorcycles carrying one or two persons in military camouflage armed with weapons moving around the communities in the council unchallenged. It also learnt that a truck transporting logs of wood from the forest was set ablaze by the terrorists, when the driver of the truck, on sighting them, abandoned the vehicle and took to his heels. The council secretary of Munya local government, Mr James Jagaba, confirming the development, said the terrorists were sighted by villagers around Chibani, Injita, Tsohon Kabula and Jesso. A source from the area said the terrorists were also seen around Gini and Gunu axis.
