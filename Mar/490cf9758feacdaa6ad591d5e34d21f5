Two persons have been arrested by the police in Ogun State for allegedly killing a commercial motorcyclist after snatching his bike. The suspects, Hammed Ismail and Osoba Yakubu, were nabbed after a report was lodged at Sango divisional headquarters on Tuesday by one Saliu Buhari. The said Saliu had told the police that his 25-year-old son, Yusuf Buhari, who he said left home with his bike a day earlier, had been found dead in an uncompleted building at Araromi village, via Ilogbo town, without his bike. Upon the report, the DPO of Sango Ota division, SP Saleh Dahiru, was said to have detailed detectives to the scene to evacuate the corpse and handed same to the family, having insisted that he should be buried according to Islamic rites. To unravel the mystery behind the bike rider’s death, the police, in collaboration with men of the So-Safe Corps and local vigilantes, had embarked on technical and intelligence-based investigation.
