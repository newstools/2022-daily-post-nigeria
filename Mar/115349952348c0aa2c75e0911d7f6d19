As part of activities marking the 85th birthday of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, a novelty football match was played Friday at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL), Abeokuta, Ogun State. The celebrant, Obasanjo was the captain of the OOPL team, which played against the Ogun State Government team led by the Deputy Governor, Noimot Salako-Oyedele. During the football match, Obasanjo scored two of the four goals during the run of play to defeat Team Ogun, which scored two goals.  Speaking to newsmen after the match, Obasanjo appreciated God for his fitness in spite of his age. The former President advised everyone, especially the elders, to inculcate what he tagged DREMS – Diet, Rest, Exercise, Medical examination and Social interactions. These, he said, were the secrets behind his agility and fitness, even as an octogenarian.  Commenting on the football match, the Ogun Deputy Governor said, “As part of the events commemorating the 85th Birthday of our Elder Statesman, His Excellency Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, I captained the Ogun State 5-a-side team against the OOPL, one captained by Baba himself. “It was a goal-fest with Baba scoring several goals himself. “May Almighty preserve us all to celebrate with Baba again next year in good health.”
