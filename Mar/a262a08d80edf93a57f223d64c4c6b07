The leadership of the Taraba State chapter of the Muslim Council of Nigeria (MCN) has again berated the state governor, Arc. Darius Dickson Ishaku, of bias in his recent appointments of the principal officers of the state university. In a press statement jointly signed by the MCN chairman, Khadi Abdulmumini Abubakar, and the secretary, Alhaji Chindo Bose, as well as 18 members of the council, and sent to journalists on Friday in Jalingo, the state capital, the council expressed sadness at the alleged insensitivity of the governor to the multi-religious and diverse ethnicity of the state in appointing the principal officers of the university. The council lamented the alleged relegation of Muslims as well as some ethnic groups to the background. The appointees, according to the statement by the council, are Professor Sunday Paul Bako, Vice-Chancellor; Joseph Bibinu, Registrar; Mr Abraham Bagu, Bursar; and Israel Idris, Librarian, all of whom the council argued were not only Christians but also hailed from the same geopolitical zone and tribal affiliation. Wondering why the governor has not deemed it necessary to extend an olive branch to the Muslims and other ethnic groups, especially in the areas of appointments and employments, they said, “It is worthy to note that some of the applicants who scored higher points during the interview were not considered for the simple fact that they did not meet the qualification agenda of the Governor.” The council said it views the action of the Governor in the appointments of the principal officers as insensitive to the multi-religious and multi-ethnic nature of Taraba State. It urged Ishaku to address the issues raised and review the contentious appointments of permanent secretaries and principal officers of the university among others “in line with the Oath of Office he swore to guide him in the discharge of his duties to all Tarabans”.
