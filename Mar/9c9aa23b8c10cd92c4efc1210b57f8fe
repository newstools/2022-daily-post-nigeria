The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has arrested a notorious drug dealer in Taraba, Micha Godwin. Godwin was apprehended at Nukai market, along Jalingo-Wukari road in the state capital, Jalingo. On Wednesday, Femi Babafemi, NDLEA spokesman said anti-narcotic officers came under an attack which left seven injured and one vehicle damaged. His statement noted that following intelligence, the agency stormed the market Tuesday afternoon to arrest the drug dealer and evacuate illicit substances in his warehouse. After he was nabbed, miscreants mobilised from the community attacked the officers and vehicles with dangerous weapons. Officers sent from the NDLEA and other security agencies rushed to the scene to rescue them. Babafemi quoted Godwin saying: “What happened today is bad because this is the second time I have been arrested and brought here. “The first arrest was not like this. I don’t know who invited the boys who attacked the NDLEA officers”. NDLEA Chairman Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa (rtd) condemned the assault and directed a switch to new operational guidelines that will make officers defend themselves adequately. Marwa warned that any obstruction or attack on operatives in line of duty by suspects or their supporters would receive a commensurate response.
