Farmers and residents of Ikakumo-Akoko community in Akoko North East Local Government Area of Ondo State have resolved to stay away from their farms following incessant attacks by suspected herders. The farmers in the agrarian community made the decision after one of them was attacked and macheted by herdsmen in his farm. The victim, a 40-year-old farmer identified as Mr Idowu Bayode, was said to have been seriously injured during the attack. According to the farmers, they will stay away from their farms until help comes their way. On his hospital bed, Bayode who described how he was attacked while at his cashew farm, said he encountered two herders harvesting cashews into sack bags, and when he questioned them, they attacked him with their cutlasses. He added that when his brother arrived to check on him at the plantation, he spotted him in a pool of blood, where the herders had inflicted terrible slashes on him. Mr Festus Omogboye, Chairman of the Ikakumo Development Council, said Ikakumo was under siege because people were afraid to go to their own farms and markets while Prince Foluso Aminu, a community leader, called on the government to beef up security in the area. Confirming the incident, the Police Public Relations Officer in the State, SP Funmilayo Odunlami, stated that investigation has begun into the incident, adding that the command had taken steps towards looking into the matter in order prevent further occurrence.
