A popular socio-political activist, Shehu Sani on Friday named the three most dangerous terrorists in Nigeria. Sani, who represented Kaduna Central Senatorial District in the eighth National Assembly, revealed that Bello Turji, Gide, and Manjagara are the most dangerous terrorists in Nigeria. He lamented that these terrorists are specialists in raping women, killing, kidnapping people, and razing down villages. In a tweet, the former lawmaker disclosed that the three terrorists are of Fulani ethnic group. Sani, who described them as evil, stressed that their activities are unforgivable. “The most dangerous terrorists in Nigeria today are Turji, Gide and Manjagara, and they are all of our Fulani ethnic group; killing, raping, kidnapping people and burning down villages. They are evil men and those who pamper them or cover them up are equally evil. Their atrocities are unforgivable,” he said. Turji has been on the security wanted list for banditry activities in Zamfara State. He recently freed over 70 kidnapped victims in his custody in the state. The development was disclosed by the Co-Chairman of the state Committee on Finding Lasting Solutions to Banditry, Dr. Abdullahi Shinkafi. Dr. Abdullahi told Channels Television that the victims were freed by the bandit kingpin unconditionally, stressing that the development was a sequel to a military air raid on bandit camps in the state.
