An enraged mob in Ondo town, capital of Ondo West Local Government Area of Ondo State, has set ablaze a yet-to-be-identified man who was alleged to be a member of a gang stealing motorcycles in the area. The suspected thief was apprehended when he allegedly returned to the robbery scene his gang had earlier operated. The angry mob was said to have identified him while trying to get information on the whereabouts of other members of his gang who had been arrested by the police. According to an eyewitness, Meyo Adeola, “The victim had been in the habit of stealing items such as vehicle batteries, generating sets and motorcycles in the area. “Residents have been on the lookout for him before nemesis caught up with him. “The deceased had no idea that residents were already aware of his illegal operations. He was issued the last warning when he was caught the last time by residents, which he blatantly ignored. “He arrived in the early hours of Sunday, as usual, to steal a motorcycle and in the process hurt the rider.” “People in the neighbourhood were alerted by the victim’s scream. As a result, they mobilized and set up a siege against him. On Monday morning, he was arrested, beaten, then burnt to death around 8:30 a.m. “This time, the people refused to let him off the hook, which is why they didn’t wait too long or give him over to the police.” When contacted, the Fagun Division Police confirmed the arrest of one of the suspects as well as the burning of the suspect.
