Kaduna Commissioner for Budget and Planning, Muhammad Sani Abdullahi (Dattijo) on Tuesday joined the 2023 governorship race. The former Chief of Staff says he will ensure continuity in governance and the state’s evolving development. Dattijo promised to sustain Governor Nasir El-Rufai’s achievements, build on them, expand security and grow a vibrant economy. In a declaration statement, the aspirant said he was privileged to learn from his principal and understudy the All Progressives Congress (APC) government policy intervention. “Over the last 7 years, I have had the unique opportunity to work closely with and support our Governor in his efforts to transform our dear state. “As even his harshest critics will accept, the period from 2015- date is the most historic development our state has witnessed since its creation. “I am confident of my ability to sustain all that has been achieved so far and continue to Move Kaduna Forward”, he noted. Dattijo further stressed the need to ensure that the gains are not reversed “under whatever circumstances.” The international development expert served as special adviser to former United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon. He was, in 2018, appointed by the World Bank as a member of the Expert Advisory Council on citizen engagement. Dattijo’s declaration came on the same day Senator Uba Sani (representing Kaduna Central) declared his intention to run for governor.
