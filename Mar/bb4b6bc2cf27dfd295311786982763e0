Ghana players trained in darkness at the Moshood Abiola Stadium in Abuja, after the mandatory one-hour that was allocated to them. After the Black Stars exceeded their time, they were asked to leave the pitch for groundsmen to work on it. However, despite appeals from officials of the Confederation of African Football (CAF), they refused to leave. Moments later, the lights at the stadium went off and the players groped around in darkness. They will play the second leg of their 2022 World Cup playoff against Nigeria on Tuesday. The first leg ended goalless at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi. The winner over the two legs will represent Africa in Qatar. —
