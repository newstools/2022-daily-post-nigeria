Manchester United youngster, Anthony Elanga has opened up on the attitude of Cristiano Ronaldo towards fellow players at the club. Elenga said it was good to have Ronaldo, who he described as a good person, at the club as he influences him on and off the pitch. Elanga, who was brought into the senior squad this season, has already had the opportunity of playing alongside the greatest of all types, Ronaldo on several occasions this season. And the youngster, who joined the Red Devils from Malmo at the age of 12, and has made 28 first-team appearances, feels fortunate to play with the Portuguese international “It’s really good [to have Ronaldo as a mentor] because I go to training quite early and see him there,” Elanga told Manchester United’s official website. “If we have had a game the day before, we speak about the game or training. “He’s a really good person to have around the building, not just because of what he does on the pitch, but what he does off the pitch as well. “If we [young players] need any help we can speak to him. So he’s a really good person to be around.”.
