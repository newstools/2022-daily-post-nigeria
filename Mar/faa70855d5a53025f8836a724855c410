Metropolitan Catholic Archbishop of Abuja Diocese, His Grace Ignatius Kaigama has condemned the Federal Government’s handling of mass murder by bandits and terrorists. The cleric spoke on Sunday in his homily at the Our Lady Help of Christians, Dagba in Abuja, NAN reports. Kaigama maintained that wars don’t end conflicts, but destroy the lives, dignity and freedom of human beings. He said Jesus Christ, while disarming Peter at His arrest in the garden of Gethsemane, also disarmed every soldier on the march to war. Kaigama mourned with the people of Kagoro community in Kaduna over the brutal attack on March 20. The Archbishop lamented how gunmen murdered more than 34 people, destroyed over 200 houses and 32 shops. “Enough of this violence and bloodshed. How much more can this and similar atrocities in parts of Nigeria take place before decisive actions are taken by the authorities. “Having prayed fervently for Ukraine, let us pray for Southern Kaduna and those areas in Nigeria, where killings, kidnappings, banditry and others, seem to have become normal phenomena”, he said. Kaigama appealed to the Blessed Mother “to bring these killings and destructions to a rapid and definitive end”. He expressed excitement to be and pray with Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) from the North-East and other residents.
