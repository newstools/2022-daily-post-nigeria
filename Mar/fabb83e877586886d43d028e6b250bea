Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba, has named former Liverpool star, Emre Can as the toughest opponent he has faced in his career so far. Pogba faced Can both at the international and club level. Can played 166 times for Liverpool, scoring 14 goals and registering 12 assists during his time in the Premier League. The German eventually left Liverpool for Juventus in June 2018. Can, who currently plays for Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga, won Serie A title on two occasions as well as the Italian Super Cup with the Old Lady. Speaking on the toughest player he has faced, Pogba told JOE: “Emre Can, yeah. “Obviously, N’Golo [Kante] and everything, but one day I remember I had a big battle with Emre Can. But with Kante, you pass him and you think there’s another N’Golo because he comes back so fast.”
