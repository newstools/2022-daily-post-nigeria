Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, has said the ‘secret’ to Manchester City’s success is continuity off the pitch. The German stated this on Friday while speaking to the media ahead of Sunday’s derby. Rangnick is the seventh man to be put in charge of United, including caretaker spells by Ryan Giggs and Michael Carrick, since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down in 2013. United will appoint another permanent manager at the end of this season. Rangnick said: “What is obvious, not only with Manchester City but also with Liverpool, they’ve had continuity and consistency in their position of manager and head coach for five or six years. “They have a very clear identity, a clear idea of how they want to play. I know Jurgen in person and Pep from Germany when he was at Bayern Munich, he also has a clear idea of how he wants to play. “This idea is the headline for everything that happens in the club, for recruitment, for any new players that they sign or at one stage will sell. This is the secret behind their success that they know exactly how they want to play. “You can also call it a corporate identity and this is their guideline for everything they do, for new players, staff members, for experts in different areas of the game that have become more important. This is what all the top clubs in Europe have in common and something Manchester United needs to be developed and improved in the next couple of years.”
