Manchester United are reportedly open to allowing forward, Cristiano Ronaldo to leave Old Trafford if he decides to do so in the upcoming summer transfer window. According to CaughtOffside, the Red Devils will not stop Ronaldo from leaving Old Trafford in the summer and are interested in Everton’s Richarlison to potentially replace the Portugal captain. Ronaldo has struggled since the appointment of Ralf Rangnick as interim manager and could potentially be looking to leave Man United at the end of the season. The report added that the Red Devils have no intention of trying to convince the five-time Ballon d’ Or winner to stay and will pursue Richarlison to replace him. It is understood that Man United have already met with the Brazilian’s representatives with regards to a potential summer move. Richarlison will reportedly cost Man United between £60 million and £70 million in the summer. He has scored four goals and registered three assists in 18 league appearances for Everton so far this season.
