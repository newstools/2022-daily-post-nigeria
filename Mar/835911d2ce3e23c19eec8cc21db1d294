The Irigwe people in Bassa Local Government Area of Plateau State have alleged that a plan to attack members of the community has been perfected. The Secretary-General of the group, Danjuma Dickson Auta, in a statement, accused the Fulani of the alleged planned attack. He explained, “As a follow-up to our earlier statement on the destruction of our crops and the killings of some cows by some individuals, we wish to state here that we received vital information of planned, orchestrated and coordinated attacks on our communities by the Fulani armed men.” The Secretary-General also alleged that they (Fulani) have since surveyed their possible areas of attack through the recent exploration of their communities by way of the grazing they’ve been carrying out relentlessly, explaining that they have destroyed farm crops worth over 4 million naira and have further impoverished their people who are mainly farmers. He called on the government and the security operatives to double efforts in apprehending those behind all the evil acts and bring them to book.
