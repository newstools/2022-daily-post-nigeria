The United States of America has said there are no plans for a meeting or call between US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin. White House press secretary Jen Psaki told CNN that “Now is not the moment,” for that. “We’re not planning a meeting between them or an engagement or a call. The President’s been very, very clear about that,” he said, adding that the White House will have those discussions internally and weigh the range of factors. Psaki was pressed further if there is any situation in which both leaders would sit down if the war between Russia and Ukraine continues and he said, “I can’t make an assessment of that.” He frowned that Russia was at this moment attacking a sovereign country in a war that has continued to escalate every day. “We’re never going to take diplomacy ever off the table but again, now is not the moment for that,” he added. Psaki said that the administration has “no assessment” on whether it is moving closer to banning Russian imports.
