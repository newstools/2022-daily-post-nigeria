Her post reads: “It’s sad enough that Nigeria is not safe but to think that a place or thing considered as property like BRT is now considered a dangerous place should all get all of us concerned. But I have a few questions for the Lagos State Government, why are the BRT buses not fitted with CCTV cameras? “What measure have you put in place since this incident that made you assure Lagosians that the BRT buses are now safe? “Are we truly safe or your speech is just government rhetoric, telling us what we want to hear? Lagosians, please be careful, we can’t move about like everything is okay. Things are not okay if we are not safe inside government buses. “And to the family of Ayanwole Oluwabamise, I sympathize with you. The actress assured the Ayanwola family of support from some celebrities to go through this phase of grieve. “Some of us will reach out to see how you can go through this phase with some measure of ease-no easy way in grieve. May God truly console you. this is such a sad incident,” she said.
