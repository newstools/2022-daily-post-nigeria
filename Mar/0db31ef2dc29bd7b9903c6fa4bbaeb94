Rangers legend, Ally McCoist, has urged Manchester United’s Marcus Rashford to join Paris Saint-Germain in the upcoming summer transfer window. McCoist believes PSG would be a ‘good move’ for Rashford as Man United are ‘all over the place’. Rashford, whose current contract will expire in the summer of 2023, is said to be considering his future at Old Trafford due to a lack of game-time so far this season. The England international has only started nine of Man United’s 28 Premier League games this term and is believed to be open to a move. “I would [make that move],” McCoist told talkSPORT. “He’s got to look at himself. Why is he not in the team? It suggests he’s not doing enough for Ralf Rangnick for him to put him in the side. “That said, you look at the club, you look at the surroundings, Manchester United are all over the place just now… “If I’m Marcus Rashford, I have got to start thinking about myself. How’s he going to get back in that England squad? “In a fresh challenge, somewhere like PSG. I have got that down as a good move.”
