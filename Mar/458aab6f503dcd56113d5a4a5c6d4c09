Former Kaduna Senator, Shehu Sani has said the All Progressives Congress, APC’s convention scheduled for Saturday is a mere formality. In a post on his verified Facebook page, Shehu Sani said the delegates would only enjoy the merriment, describing it as the traditional ritual of the ruling party. The former lawmaker said delegates from the 33 states would be attending the convention just to endorse a candidate of President Muhammadu Buhari. The post reads, “The convention is a mere formality for party members and leaders, coming from far and near to the venue, in order to totally accept and endorse the choices of Mr President for party leadership. “And to smile and dance and you must call it ‘democratic’ whether you like it or not. That is the traditional ritual of Nigeria’s ruling political party history past and present”. DAILY POST recalls that Buhari had earlier told governors elected on the platform of the party, that he would prefer Abdullahi Adamu from Nasarawa State to emerge as the APC’s national chairman.
