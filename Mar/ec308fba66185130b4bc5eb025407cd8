The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said it had registered 96,513 eligible voters in Jigawa State, in the ongoing voters’ registration exercise. The secretary of the commission in Jigawa State, Ahmed Ado Daneji, disclosed this while speaking to newsmen in Dutse, the state capital. He said the number includes those who visited the commission’s office to register and those who do it online. Daneji said out of the number, forty-nine thousand two hundred and thirty-four were men, while forty-seven thousand two hundred and seventy-nine were women. The secretary said so far only 162 Special Needs have been registered in the state. According to him “although the commission had informed the leaders of the Special Needs Association to mobilize their members on the importance of this voter registration yet only 162 were registered” He said the commission is satisfied with the number of registered voters, compared to other states whose populations were not as large as Jigawa. Daneji said there were more than 77,000 voters cards in the commission which had not been received by the owners. He, therefore, called on those who have registered since 2018 and did not collect their own to visit INEC offices to collect their voter cards.
