A former Governor of Lagos State, Senator Bola Tinubu has identified two key attributes of former President Olusegun Obasanjo as he clocks 85. He said that Obasanjo is bold and courageous, adding that he will continue to be so, for that is the essence of his character. Tinubu, in a congratulatory message by his Media Aide, Mr Tunde Rahman, on Saturday in Lagos, praised Obasanjo for his patriotism and commitment to the unity of the country. The All Progressives Congress (APC) stalwart said that “the former president had remained strong, agile and committed to the greatness of our dear nation.” He explained that although there had been instances where he had disagreed with Obasanjo on important substantive issues, the former president had made numerous useful contributions to the country. “Our debates have been spirited, yet always professional and without personal animus. “Through it all, I have come to respect his love for the country and legendary work ethics. “President Obasanjo has worked tirelessly for Nigeria, Africa and indeed the black race and has earned his stripes as an important statesman on the world stage. “Baba Obasanjo is bold and courageous and will continue to be so, for that is the essence of his character,” he said. Tinubu prayed to God Almighty to keep Obasanjo for many more years and that God grants him good health and ceaseless energy to continue to be of service to the country he loves so dearly.
