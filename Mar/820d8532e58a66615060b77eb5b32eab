The Ikot Ukpong Assembly of the Apostolic Church, Nigeria, at Ikot Ekpene Field Office, Akwa Ibom State, was on Wednesday damaged by the first rain in the state. Ukeme Umanah, an elder in the church, who spoke to the media on Friday, said the rains which started about 2 pm destroyed everything in the church including the glass pulpit, three long tables, rails and the roof, lamenting that it was a huge loss to the church. He said, “There was a rainstorm here on Wednesday around 2 pm and our church was pulled down, the entire roof was pulled down, the glass pulpit, the plastic chairs and three long benches were destroyed.” Also, another member of the church Mr. Nnamdie Akpakpan, disclosed that musical instruments were damaged beyond repairs, adding that about five buildings in the community were also destroyed. He, therefore, called on the state government and the district office of the Apostolic Church to come to the aid of the local church to renovate the building.
