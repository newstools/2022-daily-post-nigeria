Paris-Saint Germain winger, Angel Di Maria, is set to leave the French Ligue 1 giants at the end of the season. According to L’Equipe (as relayed by AS), PSG will not offer Di Maria a new contract in the summer, paving the way for the Argentine to leave the club for free. Di Maria’s current deal with PSG will expire at the end of the season. The former Manchester United star is yet to sign a new contract with PSG. The 34-year-old joined PSG from Manchester United back in 2015 in a deal worth a whopping £56.7Million. Di Maria has seen his playing time heavily reduced as his current manager, Mauricio Pochettino, continues to favour the likes of Neymar. Neymar started ahead of Di Maria in their Champions League 3-1 defeat against Real Madrid last week.
