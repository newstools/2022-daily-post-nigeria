The Archbishop Emeritus and Apostolic Administrator of Owerri Archdiocese, Most Rev. Anthony J.V. Obinna, on Thursday opened up on how he intends to retire. The outgoing Bishop of Owerri, who declared that there is no more divide into diala/amadi – osu- ume – ohu among Ndigbo, said he would continue as the Archbishop Emeritus, Apostolic Administrator of the vacant seat of Owerri Archdiocese until Archbishop Ugorji takes possession of the Archdiocese of Owerri. The fiery clergy, who made this disclosure at the Maria Assumpta Cathedral, Owerri, while briefing journalists on St.Patrick’s Day celebration, said he would still be serving with the authority of a Bishop in Owerri Archdiocese until Archbishop Ugorji is formally installed on Thursday 23rd June 2022. He said,” We pray for Archbishop Ugorji, who was elected the new President of the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria (CBCN), on Wednesday 9th March 202 and wish him all the best as he takes up his multiple responsibilities.” On diala/amadi – osu- ume – ohu among Ndigbo, the Bishop Emeritus said,” On Thursday, the 10th March 2022 the Catholic Bishops of lgboland, in Onitsha and Owerri Ecclesiastical Provinces, jointly issued a Pastoral Directive to end the idolatrous, inhuman and painful discrimination among Ndiigbo.” He said the practice has been showing its negative effect in “Marriages, Ezeship, lgweship, Chieftaincy honours and various offices in church, public and community life”. The fiery clergy further said the Pastoral Directive was signed by the nineteen Catholic Bishops of the two provinces. He also spoke on the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia, which has claimed many lives and properties. “The war in Ukraine, a pandemic worse than covid-19, is in the air and affecting even lgbos and other citizens of the world. “People are intensifying prayers to God between bombs and death. Let us all join in praying for Nigerians, Ukrainians and Russians for an end to this annihilative brutality.”
