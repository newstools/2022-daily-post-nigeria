The Ekiti State High Court has sentenced one Tunmise Abraham to death by hanging for the murder of his landlady, one Bukola Olanrewaju. Abraham was found guilty of raping the landlady before eventually killing her at Olorunda Zone 7 Adebayo area of Ado-Ekiti in 2019. It was gathered that the late Olanrewaju had demanded rent arrears and electricity bills from the convict before the ugly incident. The mother of three was at home alone after her husband had gone to work while the children were said to have gone for holiday coaching when the incident happened. Abraham was alleged to have broken into the woman’s room, threatened her with a cutlass and tied her up before performing the dastardly act. It was also gathered that after the act, the tenant fled the house but some of his belongings were found in the room which suggested that he was responsible for the act. The Director of Public Prosecutions, Julius Ajibare, who prosecuted the case for the state government called four witnesses to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. The court presided over by Justice Abodunde found Abraham guilty of the offence and sentenced him to death by hanging.
