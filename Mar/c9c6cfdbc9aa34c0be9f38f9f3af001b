Mai Mala Buni, the Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, on Wednesday, paid a visit to President Muhammadu Buhari in London UK. DAILY POST earlier reported that the embattled APC CECPC chairman would be meeting with President Buhari this week. Buni made the brief stop-over in London following a medical trip to Dubai, UAE. According to one of his aides, the Yobe state Governor and Buhari “had a brief and fruitful discussions on measures to move APC forward preparatory to the national convention and the 2023 General election”. He also added that Buni “is expected back to Nigeria tomorrow, Thursday, to resume office as the Chairman APC Caretaker Committee”. APC has insisted that it would be going ahead with the National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting slated for Thursday. The spokesperson of the party and the National Youth Leader of the party, Ismaeel Ahmed, stated this while briefing journalists at the end of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) held at the party secretariat yesterday in Abuja. The decision of the party to go ahead with the NEC meeting means that Mai Mala Buni’s position as the Interim Caretaker Chairman would not be tampered with.
