Traders and shop owners at the premises of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, have lamented the extension of the strike embarked upon by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). DAILY POST recalls that ASUU had last week extended the ongoing strike by two months. Following the development, ABU shop owners and traders on Sunday in Zaria, fumed, saying their source of livelihood was cut short by the industrial action. Speaking to DAILY POST in Zaria, Alhaji Ibrahim Mustapha, who said he had trained two of his children through soft drinks he sells at the university’s premises, said since the ASUU strike started, students who were his customers, have vacated from their hostels as he hardly sell N500 worth of soft drinks a day. “Now, feeding is a problem. I cannot guarantee my two wives a cup of gari for now,” he lamented. According to him, whenever school is in full session, he usually sleeps in his shop as students come to buy soft drinks, even in the middle of the night. Also, Hajia Mariam Na’ Allah, who fries yam, sweet and potatoes within the school premises, said ASUU strike has disorganized her plan in 2022. She said, “With little money I saved since 2021, I planned to add more money this year to buy land and start building my own house, but the plan is already shattered due to the ongoing ASUU strike.” According to her, she stopped going to her shop for nearly two weeks now because nobody was coming to patronise her. She begged the Federal Government and ASUU to come to the negotiation table and settle their differences amicably for the interest of the common man
