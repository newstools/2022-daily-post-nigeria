Member of Parliament of the United Kingdom, Julian Knight, has urged the UK government to allow Chelsea fans access to FA Cup semi-final tickets. Chelsea will face Crystal Palace in the FA Cup semi-final tie in April. But the Blues are unable to generate new revenue, including from ticket sales, under the current licence imposed by the UK government following the sanction on club owner Roman Abramovich. “It’s ridiculous that we face the prospect of a half-full Wembley for the Chelsea vs Palace FA Cup semi-final,” Knight was quoted by Sky Sport as saying. “Chelsea is more than just its owner, it is a living organism with huge importance to its fans and community. It was understandable that, at short notice, last week’s game against Middlesbrough went ahead without Chelsea fans but, with this much notice, the FA have no excuse for excluding them. “The FA must be allowed to sell tickets to Chelsea fans so long as all money goes to the people of Ukraine.”
