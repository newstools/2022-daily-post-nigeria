The Special Assistant to the Jigawa State Governor Muhammad Badaru Abubakar on Media Bello Zaki has dumped the All Progressives Congress, APC, for the New Nigeria People’s Party, NNPP. The ex-Badaru’s spokesman made his declaration on Monday at the NNPP state congress held at the state mini stadium in Dutse, the state capital. Zaki said he joined the party alongside his supporters for the APC failure to provide good governance for Nigerians. Speaking at the congress, the chairman congress committee sent by party national headquarters, Mr Takwak Mikaial, said the party was established on principles of democracy. He said the new state executives of the party emerged through consensus. He, however, described the mammoth gathering of party members at the congress as a sign of hope and confidence Jigawa State people have on the party.
