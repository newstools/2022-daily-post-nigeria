Mallam Uzaifa Halilu Modachi, a final-year medical student in Ukraine and indigene of Sokoto State who was among the rescued students from Ukraine is dead. Modachi died two weeks after returning to Sokoto from Ukraine. He was one of many Nigerians that were evacuated from the country when the war between Russia and Ukraine started. A family source told DAILY POST in Kaduna State that the deceased had stayed in Ukraine for some years and was a final year student of Zaporozhye State Medical University, Ukraine. He was said to be preparing for his final year examination before the Russia Ukraine conflict broke out. His father, Hon. Habibu Haliru Modachi, a member of the Sokoto State House of Assembly, said: “God gives and God takes away life and that’s how He wanted it to happen, there is no doubt about it.” According to his father, had he died in Ukraine, so many things would be said about him, that he was either killed by the Russian bombardment or had an accident or even was accidentally shot and killed in the crossfire. “We are grateful to God, we also thank the Nigerian government, particularly Sokoto State for taking the decision to evacuate them before the full escalation of the war,” he said. Though details of his death were scanty as at the time of this report, it was gathered that Modachi had since been buried according to Islamic injunctions.
