Former Leicester City striker, Emile Heskey has rated Super Eagles star, Kelechi Iheanacho, as the best finisher at the club. Heskey stated this ahead of Leicester City’s away Premier League tie with Arsenal on Sunday. Iheanacho netted a sublime goal in Leicester City’s UEFA Europa Conference League 2-0 victory against Stade Rennes on Thursday night. The former Manchester City star scored Leicester’s second goal with a curling finish in stoppage time. “Kasper Schmeichel says Iheanacho is the best finisher at the club and that is fantastic. The finish was not easy at all. It’s great for him to score, especially with Jamie Vardy being out,” Heskey told BT Sport. “The club relies on [Jamie] Vardy, but it’s not just about him.” Iheanacho has so far scored five goals and registered nine assists in 28 appearances across all competitions for Leicester City this season.
