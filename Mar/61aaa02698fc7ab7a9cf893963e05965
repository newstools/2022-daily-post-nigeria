Former Manchester United star, Gary Neville has said no Red Devils player would get into the current Manchester City team. Neville spoke ahead of Manchester United’s clash against City at the Etihad on Sunday. Manchester United are currently 19 points behind their city rivals who are leading the Premier League table. Neville said that Pep Guardiola’s City’s squad is far superior to Ralf Rangnick’s. “I can be really honest about it, I’ll go through them,” he told LADbible TV. “[Ruben] Dias, [Aymeric] Laporte, [Joao] Cancelo and [Kyle] Walker — they’re better than all of United’s back four. “Fernandinho and Rodri, they’re better than United’s holding midfield players. Bernardo Silva, [Ilkay] Gundogan… “Bruno is the only one that I think, over the last 12 to 18 months, could… but [Kevin] De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva, [Riyad] Mahrez, [Phil] Foden and [Raheem] Sterling. “I can’t put Bruno in ahead of Bernardo Silva at the moment, or De Bruyne. I can’t. It’s a sad indictment really.” A win over Manchester City at the Etihad on Sunday will help brighten Manchester United’s hopes of finishing in the top four and book a Champions League place for next season. For Manchester City, Pep Guardiola’s side would be just three points ahead of Liverpool, who defeated West Ham on Saturday, if they are defeated on Sunday.
