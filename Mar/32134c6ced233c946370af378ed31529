Ukraine President, Volodymyr Zelensky, has said people are dying in Ukraine due to NATO’s weakness. Zelensky lamented that NATO approved the further bombing of Ukrainians by failing to impose a no-fly zone over the country. In a speech last night, the President said such a sanction would have protected civilians from the air. According to Zelensky: “All the people who die from this day forward will also die because of you, because of your weakness, because of your lack of unity. “Today, there was a NATO summit, a weak summit, a confused summit, a summit where it was clear that not everyone considers the battle for Europe’s freedom to be the number one goal. “Today, the leadership of the alliance gave the green light for the further bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages, having refused to set up a no-fly zone.”
