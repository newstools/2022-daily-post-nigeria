President Muhammadu Buhari has greeted the wife of former Head of State, Mrs Maryam Abacha on her 75th birthday. The leader congratulated the former President of Nigeria Army Officers Wives’ Association (NAOWA), 1985-1990 on the milestone. A statement Thursday night by presidential spokesman Garba Shehu noted the warmth, large-hearted and charitable works of the matriarch of the Abacha family. Buhari said she used every God-given opportunity to reach out to the poor and underprivileged. He listed Maryam’s contribution to the establishment of National Hospital for Women and Children, which later became National Hospital, Abuja. Buhari affirmed that her initiative and leadership “transformed many lives across the country, particularly wives of military officers, girl-child, rural women and children”. He further hailed Mrs Abacha for leading campaigns and funding education and self-improvement skills for women, opening up opportunities in Small Medium Scale Enterprises, operating farms and encouraging many into agriculture. The President also commended Maryam for inspiring the African First Ladies Peace Mission, Poverty Alleviation Programme, National Programme on Immunisation, Family Support Programme, Family Support Basic Education Programme and Family Economic Advancement Programme.
