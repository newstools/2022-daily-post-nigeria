Lagos State Government has pleaded with motorists to show understanding over the planned reopening of Lekki-Ikoyi Toll Gate. Information Commissioner, Gbenga Omotoso, spoke Wednesday, on Arise News about the plan by Lekki Concession Company (LCC) to resume tolling. The collection will commence April 1 after 18 months, but the first two weeks will be free of charge. Omotoso begged Lagosians to be compassionate about the plight of the 500 LCC staff who have been out of work for 18 months. The official said the firm had huge debts to pay, owing local lenders N61.1million and foreign lenders $31.1million. “It is also economically unrealistic and investment unfriendly for the Toll Plaza to remain shut forever. “LCC has financial obligations to discharge to its creditors while its staff, about five hundred, also need to get back to work and earn their livelihood. “The restoration of operation follows engagement with stakeholders, such as the residents association, traditional rulers, transport union and others.” Omotoso noted that the LCC has been a major partner in the development of infrastructure on the Victoria Island-Lekki-Ikoyi-Ajah corridor. The commissioner added that the company contributes to the reconfiguration of the first, second and Ajah roundabouts, traffic ease as well as security.
