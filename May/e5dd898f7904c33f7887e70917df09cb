Sevilla club president, Jose Castro has confirmed that Manchester United loanee, Anthony Martial will return to Old Trafford this summer. Castro said that Martial did not play well during his loan spell at Sevilla. After his big-money move from Monaco in 2015, Martial failed to live up to expectations despite a solid start for Man United. The France international was shipped off to Sevilla on loan in January after falling out of favor at Manchester United. He was hampered throughout his time at Sevilla because of persistent hamstring injury. In an interview with Canal Sur Radio, Castro said: “It can’t be otherwise, we have made a major effort. He’s a player who has shown his value, but who hasn’t been able to adapt, he has had several injuries.” He continued: “It was a pure loan and he will return to United. He didn’t play the way we wanted him to, I don’t want to say I didn’t try, but things didn’t work out.”
