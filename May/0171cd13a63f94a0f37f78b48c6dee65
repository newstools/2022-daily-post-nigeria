British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson has identified Russian President, Vladimir Putin’s two major mistakes amid the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Johnson said Putin’s mistake was to invade Ukraine and that the carcasses of his Russian armour littering the fields and streets of Ukraine are monuments to his folly. According to him, these are gigantic errors that only an autocratic leader can make, adding that he has done an advertisement for democracy. He disclosed this in his remarks to the Ukrainian parliament on Tuesday, according to the BBC. Johnson said, “Putin’s mistake was to invade Ukraine, and the carcasses of Russian armour littering your fields and streets are monuments not only to his folly but to the dangers of autocracy itself. “What he has done is an advertisement for democracy.” Recall that the war between Russia and Ukraine began in February this year. Both neighbouring nations have been fighting for more than two months since Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine due to some political differences. As of today, many casualties have since been recorded as a result of the war.
