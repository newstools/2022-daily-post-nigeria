Zubair Abdulrra’uf, a community leader in Birnin Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State on Monday said the criminal elements, code-named Ansaru terrorist group have taken over many communities in two local government areas of the state. He spoke on the Channels TV programme, Sunrise Daily, on Monday, saying communities in Birni Gwari and Giwa local government areas are fully under the control of the terrorist group patrolling in military uniform. Governor Nasir El-Rufai had during the quarterly security reports a few days ago, confirmed the presence of deadly criminal elements. A similar alarm was on May, 15, 2022 raised by the Chairman of Birnin-Gwari Emirate Progressive Union, BEPU, Ishaq Usman Kasai, who said new evidence showed that two terrorist groups, Ansaru and Boko Haram, may be re-emerging in Birnin-Gwari Emirate of Kaduna State. Abdulrra’uf, who said the communities lacked the presence of government security apparatus, said the locals had accepted Ansaru as their saviour. According to him, many parts of Birni Gwari and some parts of Giwa local government, notably, in six wards of Giwa local government; Kidandan, Galadimawa, Kadage, Yakawada and to some extent Pan Hauya, are the places you will find this Ansaru. He said the terrorist group is providing security for the people against the bandits who have been attacking them constantly. “This Ansaru’s presence, as I am telling you, is very very prominent. Anybody who follows that route will feel secure but the locals there are being indoctrinated with this kind of ideology of this group. “So, that is what is happening in the whole of the eastern part of Birnin Gwari to Giwa local government area and the people there feel more secure to be with Ansaru than the bandits.” He said
