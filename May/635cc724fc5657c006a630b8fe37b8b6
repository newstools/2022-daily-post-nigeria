Jigawa State governor, Muhammad Badaru Abubakar has joined other interested presidential aspirants to contest for the seat of number one citizen under the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). He has also acquired the N100 million nomination form. Governor Badaru, during an APC stakeholders meeting held at Government House Dutse on Tuesday evening, was quoted as saying, “I will join the Presidential race since everyone knows I’m a highly qualified person to do the job”. The Governor was also said to have told the gathering during the meeting that he was pressurized to contest for the presidential seat by his colleagues. His media aide, Auwalu Sankara, said his principal sought President Muhammadu Buhari’s blessings before buying the form. Governor Badaru is now almost the number 12 in the APC seeking to replace Buhari in 2023. Our correspondent gathered that the decision of the All Progressives Governors Forum to push Governor Badaru to contest for the presidential seat might not be unconnected with the fact that in case southerners pick their candidate from PDP it will pave way for the APC candidate. Sankara further explained that his boss has the know-how to continue where Buhari stopped.
