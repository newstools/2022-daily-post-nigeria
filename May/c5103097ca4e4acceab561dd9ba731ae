Another video of Kaduna-Abuja train victims in captivity emerged on Monday, with eight of the victims appealing to the Federal Government to listen to the bandits’ demands, with a view to rescue them. The eight victims consisted of five men and three women guarded by armed masked terrorists. The terrorist was heard saying; “We are the people that abducted these people from the Abuja-Kaduna train, so they are appealing to us saying that they wanted to talk to Federal Government and we gave them chance to speak. It is left for you to listen to them or abandon them.” The abductors of 62 bombed train passengers, though, not interested in monetary ransom, had threatened to start killing the victims, if the Federal Government did not negotiate with them. In the new video that emerged on Monday, a victim, who identified herself as Mariam Abubakar, said her children had fallen sick in captivity. “I was one of those captured on that train with four of my children and my husband. We are appealing to the Federal Government, our families and everyone that can to please come to our aid. We have been here for 62 days and the unfavourable inhabitable conditions are unimaginable. “We have been sick. In fact, one of my sons, two of them are even sick at the moment with no medical supplies. So, we are pleading with you to please come to our aid,” she said. Relatives of the kidnapped victims have made repeated calls for their release, with the Federal Government assuring that steps are being taken to rescue the passengers.
