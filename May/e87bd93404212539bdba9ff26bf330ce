Misinformation and distrust by some All Progressives Congress, APC, members caused Thursday’s violence at the party’s House of Assembly Primaries in Alimosho area of Lagos State. Chairman, Mosan-Okunola Local Council Development Area (LCDA), Princess Olabisi Adebajo, said this on Friday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). NAN recalls that there was delay on Thursday, leading to postponement of the APC House of Assembly primaries for Alimosho Constituency I, which held on Friday. Adebajo said the delays led to suspicion among party supporters who thought the process had been hijacked, hence the violence. According to her, the vice-chairman of the council was injured and some members of staff were battered, while several vehicles and items were damaged. She said the situation made the council request watertight security, saying: “Today the environment is cool and calm, we have enough security around.”. “They (party supporters) thought that the voting was taking place because of the delay. They even checked vehicles for ballot boxes,” she said. She described the election process where 35 ad-hoc delegates voted as free and fair. Rotimi Ekundayo emerged as winner of the Alimosho Constituency I House of Assembly primary election to clinch the ticket as the APC flag bearer for the constituency. Ekundayo defeated 18 other aspirants following votes cast by 35 delegates amidst heavy security presence and officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The Chairman of the APC electoral committee/returning officer for the constituency, Ishola Ogunsola, announced that Ekundayo polled 19 votes out of the 35 votes cast, Jimoh Orelope polled 15 votes while Mafe Abiodun got one vote.
