Chelsea forward, Kai Havertz has admitted that he still has a long way to go in terms of winning the Ballon d’ Or in the future. Havertz was a surprise guest for Merav, a young Chelsea fan from India, as part of a marketing exercise by Premier League India. Merav disclosed that Kante was one of his favourite Chelsea players, but was also full of praise for Havertz. The fan said that the Germany international could be a potential future Ballon d’Or winner. He said this while on a video call with Premier League India (via Eurosport): “I think he can be the best. “I think he can win the Ballon d’Or, but he has the potential and he is very young.” And Havertz was asked about his thoughts on the claim, to which he replied, “I think I have a long road ahead, but let’s see what the next year’s gonna bring.” Havertz joined Chelsea from Bayer Leverkusen in 2020 and has scored 13 goals and provided six assists from 44 matches in all competitions.
