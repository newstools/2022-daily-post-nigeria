The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) president, Amaju Pinnick has insisted he is happy with the national team’s display, despite the 1-0 defeat to Mexico in an international friendly in the US. The Super Eagles lost 2-1 to El Tri at the iconic AT&T Stadium. Mexico took the lead through Santiago Gimenez in the 13th minute, before Cyril Dessers headed in the equalizer. However, the Eagles conceded an unfortuitous own goal in the 56th minute, as Ekong swept into his own net. “I am happy with what we put up out there. It was the first time after the disappointment of the World Cup playoff and you can say this is a makeshift team, while Mexico had their full-strength squad out there. “I like what I saw today and I have confidence that we have appointed the right coach that can restore the glory of the Super Eagles and make them start winning once more,” Pinnick said.
