The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) Zone D, on Monday, threatened to shut down major airports if the face-off between the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and the Federal Government continued. NANS South West Zone Coordinator, Mr Adegboye Olatunji, made this known in Abuja on Monday at a protest to the All Progressive Congress (APC) Secretariat in solidarity with Gov. Dapo Abiodun of Ogun to run for a second term. Olatunji said it was time both parties came together to resolve the issues leading to the strike as students were at the receiving end. “We are planning to block government organisations that generate money for them if the ASUU issue is not resolved. “We have been protesting on this issue by occupying major roads in the South West, but we believe if we ground airports, the government will do something about the strike,” he said. NAN reports that inscriptions such as ‘Moving Ogun Forward’, we need Dapo Abiodun, Dapo Abiodun, a silent achiever, Dapo Abiodun, the people’s choice’, among others, were written on the placard during the protest.
