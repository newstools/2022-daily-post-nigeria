Former Manchester City and Manchester United midfielder, Owen Hargreaves has hailed Jose Mourinho for guiding AS Roma to win the UEFA Europa Conference League final on Wednesday night. Mourinho watched as Roma beat Feyenoord 1-0, thanks to a composed finish from Nicolo Zaniolo in the 32nd minute. It was Roma’s first European trophy since the 1961 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and Mourinho’s fifth win in as many European finals. Mourinho is now the only manager to win all three major European trophies. Speaking on BT Sport’s coverage of the final, Hargreaves said Mourinho is loved in the City of Roma for bringing direction and identity to the club. He said, “Mourinho is almost at his best when he is the underdog like you saw initially when he was at Porto. “They are not going to blow people away, that is not his style of football, but he gets the job done. Football is about winning and Mourinho wins.” “Roma have gone through a few managers, lost a direction and an identity. He’s loved in the city, but there is a way to go.”
