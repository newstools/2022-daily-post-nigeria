Kayode Ajulo, a constitutional lawyer, has branded the emergence of many presidential candidates for the 2023 general elections as a good omen for the country. However, according to Ajulo, only three of the numerous All Progressives Congress (APC) aspirants are constitutionally qualified to contest the presidential election. He stated this in an interview with NAN on Tuesday in Abuja. “From our preliminary examination of the aspirants, only three aspirants in the All Progressives Congress (APC) are constitutionally qualified to run for the president’s office,” Ajulo said, declining to elaborate further. Among the APC aspirants are Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and former Lagos Governor, Bola Tinubu. Ajulo explained that he was not surprised at the number of aspirants jostling to serve Nigeria, adding that the number was a far cry from his expectations. “Anyone with a good fortune could afford the price, and by the way, they are only aspirants buying the nomination form. It is not an automatic process that will translate to fielding such aspirants in the primaries because they will have to be screened first,” Ajulo added. Ajulo also mentioned that for those that passed the screening, the stage would be cleared for horse-trading among them ahead of the primary election.
