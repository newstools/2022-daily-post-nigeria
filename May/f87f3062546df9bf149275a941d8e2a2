Hyacinth Alia, a suspended priest in the Catholic Diocese of Gboko, Benue State, has emerged the winner of the just concluded All Progressives Congress, APC, governorship primary election in Benue state. DAILY POST recalls that Alia was suspended by the church after he joined the governorship race and picked the nomination forms of the ruling party. The priest was relieved of his duties temporarily on the grounds of the canon laws of the Catholic church which condemned participation in partisan politics. Fr. Alia was declared the winner of the primary election after polling a high number of votes to defeat his opponents. Alias defeated Barnabas Gemade, a former national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP; and Mike Aondoakaa, a former Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF). The priest polled over 7,000 votes to clinch the party’s ticket in the direct primary election which took place across the state on Friday.
