Real Madrid midfielder, Toni Kroos, has revealed how ‘close’ he came to joining Manchester United in the past under former Red Devils manager David Moyes’ regime. Man United was interested in a deal to sign Kroos from Bayern Munich during the 2013/14 season. But a potential transfer collapsed following David Moyes’ sacking at Man United and Kroos instead joined Real Madrid in 2014. “I knew beforehand that United wanted me,” Kroos said as quoted by Mail ahead of Real Madrid’s Champions League semi-final second-leg tie with Manchester City on Wednesday night. “And Moyes absolutely underlined that. It was a really nice afternoon with very pleasant people. We talked a lot about United’s football plan, which convinced me. “In the end we broke up to do it. So we agreed verbally. The next step should be to look at everything on the spot in Manchester. The move wouldn’t have been that complicated – after all, we only had one child at the time, seven months old. It would all have worked.” “I am not someone who thinks about hypotheticals,” Kroos added. “Yes, it was close. I almost went to Manchester United. But that is not how things turned out. “I don’t have these what-if-thoughts. Because there are no real answers to them. The only thing I can say with certainty is that I probably wouldn’t have won the Champions League three times with Manchester United.”
