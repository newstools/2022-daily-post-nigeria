Sheikh Ahmad Gumi has condemned the gruesome murder of Deborah Samuel in Sokoto State. The Shehu Shagari College of Education student was stoned and burnt alive for alleged blasphemy. Gumi stated that Holy Prophet Muhammad (SAW) never killed anyone despite insults by non-Muslims. The cleric made the comment at a religious teaching in his Juma’at mosque in Kaduna. In the message translated by PRNigeria, Gumi said the best way Muslims can prove their love for the Prophet is adherence to his words. The cleric reminded all citizens that being a secular State, Nigeria is not governed by religious law. “Anyone who kills a non-Muslim, who they have agreed to live peacefully with, will not smell the fragrance of Paradise for 40 years,” he said. The Sheikh explained that Islam doesn’t allow anyone to take laws into their hands and warned Islamic leaders against instigating their followers. “If we think by killing Deborah, people who are not of the same faith with us will stop insulting our prophet, then we are in delusion”, he added.
