The Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has warned candidates writing the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) to ensure punctuality as it would not alter its timetable for any candidate. The Board’s High Power Opinion Leader (HPOL), Mr Abdur-Rahman Balogun, issued the warning in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) after monitoring the exercise in Abuja on Friday. JAMB started UTME 2022 for 1,761,338 candidates that successfully registered for the examination in 755 registered computer based centres. “If your child will be writing the JAMB exam this weekend, especially those for the 7a.m. papers, please note that the exam body will not consider them to write in the other scheduled time, if they missed their time schedule. “As a body, we will not alter their timetable simply because some students are held up in traffic.” He explained that unlike previous years, Jamb will be running four sessions this year, which makes it difficult for them to wait before commencement of the exams. “Get to your centre as early as possible. Once the exams start, no student will be allowed into the examination hall, hence, early arrival is important,” he warned. He urged parents to take their ward to the venue of their examination as early as possible to avoid the risk of not writing the examination due to lateness.
