The Leader Of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, has advised Kola Abiola, the son of late MKO Abiola, to withdraw his ambition to become the next president of Nigeria because it will be a wasted effort. Primate Ayodele revealed that it is too late for Kola to run for the Presidency in Nigeria because his father’s spirit isn’t behind the aspiration. In a statement by his media aide, Oluwatosin Osho, he noted that it would be difficult for him to even secure the votes of his family members not to talk of Nigerians. He urged Kola to manage his resources instead of wasting them on a presidential ambition that would lead to nothing at the end of the day. ‘’Kola Abiola has missed it; he came out at the wrong time, and his father’s spirit is not with him on his aspiration to become Nigeria’s next president. Even his family members will not vote for him in the election. ‘’I advise him not to waste his father’s money; instead, he should manage them well because forging ahead with his presidential ambition will lead to a total waste,” he said. Kola Abiola declared his intention to run for the presidency in April under the Peoples Redemption Party platform.
