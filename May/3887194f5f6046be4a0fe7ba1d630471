Tottenham Hotspur forward Son Heung-Min and Liverpool winger Mohamed Salah have shared this season’s Premier League’s Golden Boot award. Son started the day one goal behind Salah in the race to be awarded the top scorer in England’s topflight. However, he netted twice in the space of five minutes to hit 23 goals and become the first Asian player to win the award. Salah came off the bench against Wolves at Anfield and netted in the 84th minute to tie with Son. Both players will now share the award, with Salah winning it for the third time in his career. —
