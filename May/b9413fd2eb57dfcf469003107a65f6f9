Former Arsenal striker, Thierry Henry, has given reasons why he did not reply text messages from Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk. Van Dijk, speaking to CBS SPort after their 3-2 win over Villarreal in the Champions League, accused Henry of snubbing him. Upon learning Henry was in the studio alongside Jamie Carragher and Micah Richards, the Dutchman said: “Titi? I texted him but he didn’t text me back. Titi, the legend.” Host Kate Abdo then questioned why the former World Cup winner snubbed a reply. Henry responded by saying: “I actually don’t have his number anymore. “So text me… I’ll go to someone else to get his number. I changed my number and when I put all my numbers on my new phone, he wasn’t there.”
