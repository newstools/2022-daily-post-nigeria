Alisson saved the penalties of Azpilicueta and Mount to give his side their second domestic trophy of the season and brighten their chances of winning the quadruple. “It was good hey? All goalkeeper coaches they help me with the decisions. They are fantastic players, Chelsea did really well but we deserved to win this. I only make the save because we deserved to win this,” he told the BBC. “This gives us more confidence in the Premier League and also the Champions League final. It’s a fantastic moment now, we just need to enjoy “It’s amazing, we did such a good performance. It was a shame we didn’t score. It was a proper fight, we kept a clean sheet, and then afterwards the boys were unbelievable scoring the goals. I just had to save the last one. “I am so happy. Myself and also Mendy did amazing saves. I couldn’t have done the saves without the help of the team. They work well and make it easier for me.”
