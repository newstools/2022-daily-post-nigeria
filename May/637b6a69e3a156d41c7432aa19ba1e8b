The families and friends of kidnapped passengers of the ill-fated Kaduna-Abuja train staged a peaceful protest aimed at releasing their loved ones from captivity on Wednesday. Bandits have threatened to start killing the hostages if the Federal Government does not meet up with their demands within seven days. One of their demands is the unconditional release of their detained children held in an orphanage home in Adamawa State under the strict supervision of the Nigerian Army as well as the release of their detained comrade. Following the threat, family members of the victims staged a peaceful protest in Kaduna on Thursday, begging the Federal Government to listen and act on the bandits’ demands so they can release their loved ones. According to them, it’s now 58 days their loved ones have been in captivity, beaten by the sun and rain besides other psychological problems The statement which was read out by their leaders, Dr Abdulfatai Jimoh and Dr Ba’aba Muhammad, also appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to consider their demand. “Article 7 of the Third Geneva Convention provides for the rights and protection of prisoners of war. In a similar manner, the International Humanitarian Law (IHL) also protects persons deprived of liberty as a result of armed conflicts before their eventual release. “We are appealing to the abductors of our family members to show compassion to them as fellow Nigerians,” it said.
