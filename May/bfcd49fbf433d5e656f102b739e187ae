Former Governor of Jigawa State and one of the founding fathers of the Peoples Democratic Party PDP, Sule Lamido has asked the party’s presidential aspirants to put the country first above personal interests. Lamido said this when he received three PDP presidential aspirants, Anyim Pius Anyim, Former Senate president Bukola Saraki and former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar at his residence in Dutse, the state capital. He said the All Progressives Congress APC had made life miserable for Nigerians because they got the power unprepared. Lamido noted that Nigerians believed in the PDP and know that only the PDP can rescue Nigeria from its present state of insecurity and woes “PDP has a duty in Nigeria because it is the only party that can restore hope and confidence on Nigerians”. “Today PDP have eleven aspirants and both of you have qualified but only one can be, which means God will choose for us, not me” “Our prayer is God to look at this country because this country is bleeding, we hate each other so God give us someone who can save this country” “So my prayer is let the best among you be the Nigerian president” The three Peoples Democratic Party Presidential aspirants were all in Jigawa State to solicit votes from the party’s delegates for the upcoming presidential primary election.
