Amid the ongoing strike, President Muhammadu Buhari has been urged to meet with the members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU. Deji Adeyanju, a rights activist said Buhari should personally meet ASUU and resolve the ongoing strike. Adeyanju said ASUU would listen to Buhari if he opts to meet with them. According to the Abuja-based lawyer, the President should give the body all it needs to effectively run Nigerian universities. In a Facebook post, Adeyanju wrote: “The president should meet ASUU himself and resolve the ongoing strike. They will listen to him and he should give them all they need to effectively run our universities. The state of our tertiary institutions are deplorable.” Buhari had earlier urged ASUU to consider the plight of the students and call-off the industrial action. ASUU has been on strike since February 2022.
