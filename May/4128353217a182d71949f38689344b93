Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State has described Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as President Muhammadu Buhari’s number one confidante. El-Rufai said Osinbajo had earned the respect of Buhari, state governors, and Nigerians in general. He spoke during Osinbajo’s consultative meeting with delegates of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Kaduna yesterday. El-Rufai noted that Osinbajo has earned the respect of the President, governors, and Nigerians due to the way he conducts the affairs of the National Economic Council, NEC. According to El-Rufai: “Osinbajo is the number one confidante of President Muhammadu Buhari, and has the respect of all the governors of Nigeria, across party lines, because of the way and manner he steers the affairs of the National Economic Council. “He’s not just here because he is running for President. He is here because he has a close affinity with the government and people of Kaduna State. I want those that don’t know, our party leaders and delegates, to know that Prof. Yemi Osinbajo has always shown uncommon love for the people of Kaduna State.”
