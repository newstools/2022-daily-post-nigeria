Former Crystal Palace owner, Simon Jordan has said that even Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola would have ‘struggled’ with the way Manchester United are being run at the moment. He said this while defending the German and blaming his lack of success at Old Trafford on the club’s hierarchy. Manchester United will not make it to next season’s Champions League football, having failed to at least finish within the top four teams in the league table. Following a series of bad results, Manchester United hierarchy decided to sack Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and gave Rangnick a six-month appointment but the club has continued to struggle. “I felt Rangnick would go into Manchester United and he would be a sea of change, and have the courage of his convictions to be able to put his foot down,” Jordan told talkSPORT. “I think it is much more difficult than that, the entire culture at Manchester United is wrong. The fabric of the playing squad is wrong, they have bought the wrong players, and they are going to have to change it. “I think if you put Pep Guardiola in for six months, he would have struggled with the current crop of players,” he added. Rangnick was appointed with the mandate of delivering a top four finish and Jordan believes the German’s failure to deliver is not totally his fault. According to him, previous Red Devils’ managers such as David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Solskjaer, who were all sacked by the club before Rangnick was appointed, would agree that the German is not the problem.
