Former Juventus midfielder, Mohamed Sissoko, believes Victor Osimhen will be a good addition to the Bianconeri’s squad. Juventus recruited Dusan Vlahovic in the January transfer window, but could be in the market for a new striker this summer. Argentina striker Paulo Dybala will leave the Old Lady when his contract expires next month, while Alvaro Morata has also been linked with a move to Premier League club, Arsenal. That could leave the Turin club short of firepower upfront, and Sissoko has called on his former club to lure Osimhen from Serie A rivals Napoli. Victor Osimhen without a doubt,” Sissoko told Il Bianconero when asked to nominate a replacement. “He is the right player for Juventus, there are other young and strong players but Osimhen is devastating. “I hope that Juve will have a strong player and be a champion.” The 23-year-old, who was sidelined for over two months due to injury during the 2021/22 season, registered 14 goals and two assists in 27 league appearances for Napoli.
