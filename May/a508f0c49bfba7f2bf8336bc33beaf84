Former Liverpool and Wales striker, Dean Saunders has said that Crystal Palace manager, Patrick Vieira is going to get in trouble for kicking an Everton fan to the ground after his side’s 3-2 loss in the Premier League last night. Vieira appeared to clash with an Everton fan after his side squandered a 2–0 lead to fall 3-2 to the Toffees who needed the result more to escape relegation. Jean-Philippe Mateta and Jordan Ayew gave Crystal Palace the lead in the first half, while Michael Keane, Richarlison and Calvert-Lewin scored for the home side to confirm they will play in the topflight next season. After the final whistle, thousands of overjoyed Everton fans flooded onto the pitch in celebration. And one of them repeatedly appeared to make a rude gesture in front of Patrick Vieira’s face as he walked towards the dressing room, causing the Frenchman to react violently. Dean Saunders expressed his concern that things are only going to get worse. “Someone’s going to get stabbed next. Something bad, really bad,” Saunders said on The Sports Bar. “Patrick Vieira’s going to get in trouble for what he’s done. I’m not making excuses for him, he’s just lost a game in which his side were 2-0 up and lost 3-2 and then he walks on the pitch and has got someone in his face and he reacts. He reacts the wrong way because he’s raging inside. “If I was a player I wouldn’t feel safe. You should feel safe when you run on a football pitch.”
