Veteran journalist, Bayo Onanuga has declared that Nigerians are witnessing madness in the All Progressives Congress (APC). He made the comment in reaction to the controversy over the presidential form purchased for ex-President Goodluck Jonathan. The former News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Managing Director said APC puppet masters are onto a political game of egregious mischief. Onanuga condemned the way they are encouraging every Tom, Dick and Harry to join the presidential race, “including the gentleman the party toppled in 2015”. He said at the last count, 26 people want to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari, even as more individuals may pick forms. The founder of TheNEWS Magazine noted that “the game being played” reminds him of former Head of State, Ibrahim Babangida. Onanuga recalled how IBB “taunted” the political class in 1992-1993, dangling the presidential carrot to everyone. Babangida, according to him, eventually dribbled himself into a corner and committed a historic and grievous error of annulling MKO Abiola’s election. “This is 2022, the political puppet masters appear not to have learnt any lesson. The herd of politicians, some of whom cannot win their wards are dancing to the tune of the puppeteers. “Is it not crazy that so many people want to be president? Not even in America, bigger than Nigeria many times, do we have this madness we are witnessing in APC,” he said. Onanuga however predicted that all the schemings will reach their denouement and collapse like Babangida’s.
