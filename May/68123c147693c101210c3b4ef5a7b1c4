Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has revealed why Peter Obi, former Anambra Governor and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential aspirant dumped the party. Recall that Peter Obi had on Wednesday said that recent developments within the party made it practically impossible for him to continue participating and making constructive contributions. But, Wike told Channels TV that Peter Obi lacks integrity and he left PDP because he knew he would not win the presidential ticket. “Peter Obi leaving the party is not surprising to me. He knows that there is no way he would have won the presidential primaries. Forget about what Doyin Okuope said about sharing money. “How can someone who has gone to almost all the states telling them about how he is a trader and how he wore one shoe and does not allow people carry his bag leave a party three days to the primaries? “From what I read on social media, he wants to join NNPP, but Kwakwaso wants to be president. So, does he want to be Vice President? This is what I am saying, in everything you do, integrity and character is very important. You can be the best economist but you don’t have character.”
