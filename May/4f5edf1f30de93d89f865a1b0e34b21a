A driver of a mini bus, whose name is not immediately known, has been burnt to death on the Murtala Mohammed highway, Calabar. The incident occurred late yesterday near the popular Beebobsco bus-stop. Another young man, who was believed to be the conductor of the bus, however, escaped with severe burns. Eyewitnesses said the conductor had been rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment. According to one eyewitness, Chika Ifeanyi, a motorist, “The mini bus was laden with drums of suspected adulterated diesel. “On getting to the speed breaker on the highway, just before the Beebosco junction, the next thing we heard was an explosion and fire engulfed the bus.” He added that the driver was struggling to get out of the bus but could not and was caught by the raging inferno. “The conductor of the vehicle was lucky to get out although not without severe injuries and was rushed to the hospital,” he said. The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) officials were not available to rescue the victim and could not immediately react.
