Femi Adesina, President Muhammadu Buhari’s Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, has said he will become a farmer and return to active media work when his principal leaves office. Adesina made this known in a post on his verified Facebook page after he received the All Farmers Association of Nigeria (Edo State Chapter) at his office. “When I finish in government, by the mercies of God, I intend to return to active media work and also be a farmer. May God make it happen. Amen. “It was then a big surprise to me when I got notification from the All Farmers Association of Nigeria (Edo State Chapter), saying they were coming to make me a Patron of the group. I asked myself: “how did they know I was planning to go into farming? They must have seen tomorrow.” “And true to their words, the farmers came. Farmers of cassava, cucumber, pineapples, fish, cattle, and other crops and livestock. And they made me their Patron. Men, women, and youth. They were led by their Chairman, His Royal Highness, Alhaji Bako E. Dogwo, Coordinator-General, Bassa Traditional Rulers and Elites. Others were; Gladys Iyore Emuze, Secretary, Aisha Ugbaja, Justice Agbozuadun, Zinat Shaka, and Yusuf Mohammed. “The Chairman said, having followed my activities as Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, “we decided that you deserve not only commendation but also to be honoured as our Patron.” “The farmers added: “We wish to congratulate you as you are being appointed Patron based on your antecedents. We say big congratulations, and look forward to seeing you rise higher.” “This is a surprising honour. I could only promise the farmers that I would continue to serve the President, and my country to the best of my ability.”
