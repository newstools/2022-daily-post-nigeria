Heavy gunshots were fired at the state secretariat of the All Progressives Congress in Rivers State on Wednesday, following a protest by members of the party loyal to Senator Magnus Abe. The protesters alleged that the APC committee commissioned to conduct the delegate Congress in the state had “compromised”. Some of the protesters alleged that the materials for the congress had been “hijacked” by people whom they described as powerful. A protester said she saw a senatorial aspirant under the APC in the same car with the chairman of the congress committee. The protest later turned sour after security operatives started shooting leading to a pandemonium. In the meantime, the APC in Rivers State has said it was yet to understand the purpose of the protest. The State Publicity Secretary of the APC, Chris Finebone wondered why the protesters stormed the party secretariat when the congresses are supposed to be held in the ward and local government areas. He said materials for the exercise have been sent to the various wards and local government areas where the exercise would hold. He, however, promised to address the protesters when their leaders are identified.
