The hope of one of the governorship aspirants of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Rivers State, Farah Dagogo to participate in the party primaries appears to be uncertain. This is as the Rivers State High Court again adjourned his bail application to May 25 2022. The PDP has also fixed the same date for its governorship primaries. When the parties arrived in court to argue the bail application, the trial judge, Justice Chiwendu Ngworgu, through the court clerk informed the parties that the court will not sit today and adjourned till the 25th of May. With the latest development, the hope of Dagogo taking part in the primaries has been dimmed. He had earlier missed the screening of governorship aspirants following his arrest on the eve of the exercise in Port Harcourt. Dagogo, who is the member representing Degema-Bonny Federal Constituency at the National Assembly, is facing two counts of felony with conspiracy and cultism.
