Pastor Segun Adebisi, declared missing, has been found dead in Kubwa, a satellite town of Abuja. The discovery of the remains of Pastor Adebisi was made by residents of the area on Saturday morning during a thorough search. A source in the area told DAILY POST that the disappearance of the Pastor was earlier reported to the police. According to the source, “while the search was on, people were sent to the bush around the pipeline extension area during the hours of 8 a.m. to 12 noon, but all efforts proved abortive as he could not be found.” According to him, the people conducted another search on Saturday in the morning in the same place, saying that they were at a point of giving up when somebody advised that they should look at the uncompleted building nearby. He confirmed that the Pastor’s body was surprisingly found with injuries on his head, suggesting that he was hit with a wood found close to the body, adding that the body had been taken to the mortuary. As of the time of filing this report, the FCT Police Command has not reacted to the incident.
