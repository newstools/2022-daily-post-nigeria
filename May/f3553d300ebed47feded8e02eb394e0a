Governor Abdullahi A. Sule of Nasarawa State has appealed to the leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in the State not to join the planned nationwide peaceful protest over the murder of Deborah Samuel, a female student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto State. Speaking during a security meeting held in Lafia, the State capital, Governor Sule explained that the appeal was due to the fragile nature of the State. According to Governor Sule, “I will like to appeal to our leaders, to ensure that we don’t join in this peaceful protest, especially because of the fragile nature of our State. “This is similar to what we have done also when doctors, teachers, ASUU, all in the past wanted to go on strike but we appealed to these bodies not to join.” He added that the nature of the State was peculiar and different from other States, saying that “sometimes, peaceful people, very good people would begin to protest in one way but lose control, because some hoodlums will come in and hijack the protest.” DAILY POST recalls that a female student, Deborah Samuel was gruesomely murdered on Thursday by alleged Muslim students of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto for alleged blasphemy. The National leadership of CAN had called on Christians in the country to hold peaceful nationwide protest on 22nd May, 2022, against the killing of the female student.
