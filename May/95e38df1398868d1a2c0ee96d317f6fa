Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has provided the latest injury update on N’Golo Kante and Mateo Kovacic ahead of his side’s FA Cup final against Liverpool on Saturday. Kovacic sustained an injury during Chelsea’s Premier League victory over Leeds United on Wednesday, while Kante missed the midweek tie. Speaking during his pre-match press conference ahead of Chelsea’s FA Cup tie with Liverpool at Wembley Stadium, Tuchel said: “Mateo wants to try it and the medical department gave the green light to try it. The advantage is that the ligament was not torn from the last incident so there’s no new injury. “There is heavy pain and it is heavily swollen, we are hoping maybe time is enough that he makes it. We’ll try in training and then we will know more about it.” Speaking of Kante, Tuchel added, “He is also trying. He tried yesterday in training and trained more or less everything. “It was a reduced training session because of quite a long travel and fatigue so it wasn’t high intensity. “We will also try with him today, he’s keen to make it hundred percent that we can plan with him tomorrow would be crucial for us.”
