The airlines disclosed this in a joint statement issued and made available and made available to newsmen on Sunday in Lagos. The joint statement reads: “Both managements fully identify with and endorse the efforts of the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) to bring about a conducive operating environment for Nigerian carriers as the current price of JET A1 is unsustainable and could result in the untimely demise of most airlines. “However, we have assurances that the government is looking at the issues raised by the AON and will come up with a decision that will be in the best interest of the industry and the travelling public.” ”Passengers who are booked to travel on both Arik and Air Aero Contractors tomorrow and beyond should proceed to their airports of departure to board,” the statement added. DAILY POST reports that Ibom Air had earlier countered the position of AON to suspend flight operations saying that it will continue normal operations on May 9. According to a statement issued by the airline’s management, suspending flights will make the bad situation worse.
