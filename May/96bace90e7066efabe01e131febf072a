The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar has disclosed why he visited Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State after the party’s primary election. On Monday, Atiku visited Wike in his Abuja residence for a crucial fence-mending meeting. However, the former Vice President said his visit to Wike was to ensure that every stakeholder was brought on board to boost the party’s chances of winning the 2023 presidential election. He wrote: “In continuation of my commitment to bring everyone on board in ensuring that the PDP stands as one united party, earlier today, I visited His Excellency Gov Nyseom (sic) Wike at his Abuja residence. This is a continuous process.” Atiku had defeated Wike and other PDP presidential aspirants during the party’s primary election on Saturday. The Waziri of Adamawa gathered votes of 371 delegates while Wike polled 237 votes after the Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, stepped down for him.
