Benito, the stepson of popular actress, Funke Akindele-Bello has alleged that she and his dad, JJC Skillz, have cheated on each other in their marriage. He made the revelation in an Instagram Live video on Friday. Benito said, “Funke accuses everyone of dating my dad but your beloved had cheated on my dad. My dad cheated too. “They do not sleep in the same room. They have not slept in the same room for two years.” Recall that Benito had also alleged that Funke Akindele’s marriage was troubled.
