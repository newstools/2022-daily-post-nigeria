Football pundit, Ashley Westwood, has said that the substitutions made by Real Madrid and Liverpool when both teams clash in the Champions League final on Saturday night could prove to be a major factor in deciding the tie. Westwood also said he is not expecting a tactical battle between Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp and Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti. Liverpool and Man City will clash in the Champions League final in Paris on May 28. Both teams qualified for the Champions League final after eliminating Villarreal and Manchester City, respectively. “Well, obviously, if Ancelotti wins it, he would have won it five times, he’s won it four times before, very experienced. I don’t think it’s too much of a tactical battle if I’m being completely honest. We know what tactics Liverpool play and what tactics Real Madrid play,” Westwood was quoted by Fairplay News as saying. “What it will be is a feeling. Ancelotti made some shrewd substitutions against Manchester City when they were dead and buried. He managed to manipulate a couple of different personnel, the system didn’t change, but a little bit more pace here, and a little bit more pace there, just a little tweak that seemed to give dividends.” “Obviously, Rodrygo comes on and scores and injects a bit of pace, so I think it’ll just come down to the feeling on the day and who reads the game best with the substitutions.” “The tactics won’t change too much, it will be this player performing at this level enough, can this player come off the bench and give me a little bit more in this situation and that’s where the experience comes in and that’s what will be intriguing to see. What substitutions are made at what stages of the game to just tweak things from a personnel perspective but not massively tactical.”
