Famous Nigerian comedian and filmmaker, Ayo Makun, aka AY, has opened up on his age-long rift with a colleague, Bright Okpocha known as Basketmouth. AY, in an Ask Me Anything session on his Instagram page, said he has no issues with Basketmouth but avoids him because he has an ‘uncontrollable superiority complex and childishness.’ AY said this after a fan asked, “Do you really have any issues with Basketmouth?” Responding, he said: “I don’t have issues with Basketmouth but people having unnecessary issues with you are the price you sometimes pay for being progressive. “He has been battling with an uncontrollable Superiority complex for the longest. So, avoiding his incessant childishness only became necessary for my own sanity.” AY who went further said he only speaks to those who speak to him. As of the time of this report, Basketmouth was yet to respond to AY’s revelation.
