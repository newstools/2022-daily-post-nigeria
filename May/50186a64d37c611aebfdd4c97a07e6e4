Russia has assured that tactical nuclear weapons won’t be used in the ongoing war against Ukraine. Russia’s Ambassador to Britain, Andrei Kelin, gave the assurance during an interview with BBC. Kelin said Russia has a strict code, adding that its military doesn’t use such weapons in conflicts such as the ongoing war with Ukraine. He said Russia would only use nuclear weapons when “the state’s existence is threatened.” “It has nothing to do with the current operation,” Kelin said. He also described allegations of war crimes in the Ukrainian town of Bucha as “a fabrication” while calling UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss “very belligerent” and inexperienced. Russian President, Vladimir Putin put his nuclear forces on high alert in late February, soon after the invasion of Ukraine, an act that many military analysts saw as a warning of what was to come. But since then nuclear weapons haven’t been used against Ukraine even as Putin tries to gain total control of the Donbas region of Ukraine.
