Eggon Youths Movement (EYM) has condemned the gruesome murder of Zakari Kigbu on Sunday. The former National Population Commission (NPC) commissioner was killed, while his daughters were abducted. The attack occurred at his residence at Azuba, a suburb of Lafia, the Nasarawa capital. Kigbu served as National President of Eggon Cultural Development Association (ECDA). In a statement, EYM President Godwin Dugga decried the spate of killings and kidnapping. He lamented that such incidents had become a recurrent decimal in nearly all parts of the State. Dugga charged the government and security agencies to intensify efforts to arrest and prosecute the perpetrators. ”Government must desist from paying lip service and be deliberate in addressing the increasing rate of killings, kidnapping and other forms of insecurity,” he added.
