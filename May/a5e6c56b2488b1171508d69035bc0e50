The Speaker of Ebonyi State house of Assembly, EBSHA, Mr Francis Nwifuru yesterday picked a form to run for governor under the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress APC, in the state. Nwifuru was received by the Ebonyi State traditional rulers who hail from the 13 LGAs of the state. Nwifuru said he obtained his forms to contest the party’s primaries contrary to the rumours in some quarters in the state that he was denied the forms by the National Leadership of the party following his sack by an Abuja Federal High Court for defecting to the APC. He alleged that traditional rulers are not respected in Igbo land unlike in Hausa land where their Emirs are worshipped like gods tasking the Igbos to endeavour to respect traditional institutions.
