The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) on Monday asked citizens to pray for the country. CAN General Secretary, Daramola Bade conveyed the message in a statement on behalf of the President, Rev. Samson Ayokunle. The scribe requested church leaders to organize a solemn assembly for prayers on the 13th, 14th and 15th of May, 2022. CAN listed the prayer points as “mercy and divine intervention, especially economic, political and security matters”. Christians were asked to pray to God to direct leaders to take the right steps in addressing “the dangerous situations”. “That our political leaders will not set the nation on fire by their insensitive political actions which failed to take our complexities into consideration as we approach the 2023 elections. “That God would continue to be with the electoral umpire, INEC, to stand firm without an iota of partiality in making sure that elections are free and fair. “That God should judge anyone outrightly, who, out of selfishness, is planning to create chaos in the forthcoming elections. “That daily blood shedding of innocent people and other violent acts will be put to an end by our government and divine intervention.” CAN wants supplications for God to show Nigeria mercy amid the shedding of the blood of innocent people. The Christian leadership urged the electorates to come out in 2023 and vote the right people into power. The body also called for prayers to suppress terrorists, bandits, kidnappers, other violent people, and the strengthening of security agencies and personnel. The statement expressed hope that Nigeria would experience genuine equity, justice and return to the path of greatness.
