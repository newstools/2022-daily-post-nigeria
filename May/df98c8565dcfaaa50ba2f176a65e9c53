Chelsea has reportedly dismissed claims that defender Marcos Alonso and manager Thomas Tuchel had a half-time bust-up during their Saturday’s Premier League 2-2 draw against Wolves. The Blues threw away a two-goal lead against Wolves, with Conor Coady scoring a 97th-minute equaliser as new owner Todd Boehly watched on at Stamford Bridge. Following a goalless first half, Alonso was substituted at the break and replaced by Saul Niguez, with rumours appearing on social media after the game suggesting the left-back was not too happy about his withdrawal. The issue is believed to have stemmed from a moment before half-time when Alonso lost possession and was a little slow to track back initially, prompted calls from the dugout, and the 31-year-old appeared to gesticulate and yell back at the bench. But, according to The Sun, Chelsea has denied any bust-up between Alonso and Tuchel in the dressing room during the half-time interval. The report added that Alonso did, however, feel that he was having his effort questioned during the match and was being made a scapegoat for Chelsea’s poor display in the first half against Wolves. Rather, the Spaniard felt the team’s tactics were to blame for the ineffective display and their disappointing end to the season in general. Nevertheless, Alonso respects Tuchel’s right as the manager to sub him off and hopes to be chosen against Leeds United on Wednesday evening to put the incident behind them. The report also added that Tuchel pulled his players back in for extra training after the match against Wolves and is desperate to get the players back to their previous high standards, particularly before their FA Cup final against Liverpool this weekend.
