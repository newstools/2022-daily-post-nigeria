Despite reports that President Muhammadu Buhari has accepted the resignation of some of his cabinet members, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, has insisted that he has not resigned. Instead, Malami said he has withdrawn his ambition to contest the 2023 Kebbi State gubernatorial elections. The AGF stated this in a statement by his media aide, Dr Umar Gwandu. “Malami has the right to choose to voluntarily shelve his gubernatorial ambition. “It is a matter of personal conviction and individual right which didn’t violate any law. “Right thinking members of the society accord respect to individual’s right to freedom of choice in matters relating to this” Gwandu stated. As an individual Nigerian citizen with inalienable fundamental rights, Malami said he is not aware of any legally justifiable and reasonable tenable obligations compelling him, a SAN or an Attorney General of the Federation to do otherwise. “The decision is not only a demonstration of altruism and patriotism, but of contentment, self-control, placidity and decisiveness in problem-solving at a time shrouded with confusing and competing stimulus. “It is a commendable posture worthy of admiration coming from a paragon of virtue,” the statement added. Recall that President Buhari had last week ordered any of his ministers interested in the 2023 general elections to tender their resignation before May 16th. While some had adhered to the directive, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige; and the Attorney General of the Federation and the Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami have insisted that they are still part of Buhari’s cabinet.
