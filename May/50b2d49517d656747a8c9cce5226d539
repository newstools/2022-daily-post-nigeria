Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, has insisted he has not made a u-turn to ask that his £1.5bn to the club is paid back. According to SportingLife, a spokesperson for the Russian has released a statement rejecting media and UK government claims. The £1.5bn loan was accumulated over the last 19 years that Abramovich has owned the club. “Mr Abramovich has not been involved in this work and it has been managed independently by experts with years of experience working in humanitarian organizations. “Secondly, Mr Abramovich has not asked for any loan to be repaid to him – such suggestions are entirely false – as are suggestions that Mr Abramovich increased the price of the Club last minute,” the statement read in parts. It added that “Abramovich has no access or control of these funds and will not have any access or control of these funds following the sale.” Chelsea are in real danger of not playing in the Premier League and Champions League next season, as the current operating licence for the Blues expires on May 31.
