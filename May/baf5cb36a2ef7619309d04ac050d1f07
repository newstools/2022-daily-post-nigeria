The Central Banks of Nigeria, CBN has debunked reports that its Governor, Godwin Emefiele was sacked. Several online media platforms particularly blogs had reported that the CBN governor was sacked by President Muhammadu Buhari. While some social media users believe the president may need to go through legislative processes before sacking the governor, others have continued to spread rumours of his alleged sack. But when contacted by DAILY POST, the Head of Corporate Communications of the Central Bank, Osita Nwanisiobi said the purported sack was not true. Denying the report, Osita said, “I heard it just the way you got it too. As far as I am concerned, it’s a rumour, I’m not aware of any sack” DAILY POST reports that the CBN Governor has been under pressure since he declared interest in running for president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023. Some stakeholders had called for his sack over his involvement in partisan politics.
