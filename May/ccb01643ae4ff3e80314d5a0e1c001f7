Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp, has insisted that the Premier League title is not over, despite being three points behind leaders Manchester City. With three fixtures left in the season, Klopp told a press conference on Monday that it is not done and dusted. A 1-1 draw at home against Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday set Liverpool back before City hammered Newcastle United 5-0 on Sunday. Klopp was asked if he told his players the title race was over and he replied: “I’m not sure I said that because I think it’s obvious. “It’s clear it is not over, whatever happened. “We have three games to play and my concern is how we can win our three games and I have no say in how City can win theirs. We don’t stop believing, that’s what we do.” Liverpool travels to Aston Villa on Tuesday, while City is away at Wolves on Wednesday.
