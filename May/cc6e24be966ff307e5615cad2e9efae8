A 74-year-old driver, Bassey Inyang, has been arrested for allegedly defiling a 12-year-old girl in his apartment in Calabar, Cross River State. He was also accused of raping other minors in the neighbourhood. According to an eyewitness, police picked him up over the weekend following an alarm raised by the victim’s parents. He said the parents, after seeing pus and blood ooze out from the girl’s private part last week, moved to the suspect’s house when the poor girl opened up to her mother. Following the alarm, other parents who hid their experiences opened up. Secretary of Ikot Edet Etim village in Efut Abua West clan in the Mbukpa area, Mr Pendo Ned, said: “When we got this information, community head Muri Ebuka Ebuka directed that the suspect be brought before him. “The suspect had confessed to the heinous crime before the community. We seriously condemned such crime against minors reported to be perpetrated by the suspect, which reason we had invited the police to pick him for further interrogation.” Zone six PRO of Nigeria Police, Nelson Okpabi said the act of rape is condemnable in all ramifications.
