Billionaire, Elon Musk, on Friday said his $44 billion deal for micro-blogging and social media platform, Twitter, is temporarily on hold. Musk disclosed this in a tweet via his Twitter handle, citing pending details on spam and fake accounts. “Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users,” Musk tweeted. Musk, the world’s richest man, had said that one of his priorities would be to remove “spam bots” from Twitter. He recently bought Twitter for $44 billion and is expected to serve as a temporary CEO for a few months. The 50-year old has been giving insight into what the social media platform under him will be like.
