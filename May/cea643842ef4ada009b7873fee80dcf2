Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa has joined the condemnation of the murder of pregnant Harira Jibril (Fatima) and her children. The Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) in a statement on Wednesday told Anambra Governor Charles Soludo to find the killers. The deceased, from Adamawa, were gunned down on Sunday by the “unknown gunmen” at Isulo, Orumba North Local Government Area. Adegboruwa said the kids Khadija (7), Hadiza (5) and Zaituna (2) were mowed down in an insensate act of terrorism, recklessly perpetrated without any justification. “The life of the unborn baby that Mrs Jibril carried in her womb at the time of this dastardly act was also cruelly terminated”, he fumed. The lawyer said there can be no justification for the brutality extended to toddlers and the unborn. “There should be no hiding place for the barbarians. Governor Charles Soludo owes the nation the sacred duty to do all in his powers to fish out those who killed Mrs Jubril and her children.” Adegboruwa noted that the concept of national unity would be a mirage if citizens do not feel safe in other locations different from their places of origin. The SAN said if the “primitive and evil motive” is to provoke an ethnic war, Nigerians should resist. He charged the people to continuously hold the government accountable to the discharge of its responsibilities of securing lives and property. Adegboruwa consoled the victim’s family, Adamawa and Anambra States, expressing hope that the perpetrators would be caught and prosecuted. The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has also called on security agencies to track the murderers. The body urged South-East leaders to stop the killings.
