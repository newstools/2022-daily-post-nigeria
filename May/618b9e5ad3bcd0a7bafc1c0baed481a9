Anambra State Governor, Prof Chukwuma Soludo, says criminals terrorizing Anambra State are fighting to enthrone idol worship over Christianity. Professor Soludo stated this at the Second Session of the Sixth Synod of Anglican Diocese of Aguata, held at St James’ Church, Nanka, Orumba North Local Government Area on Sunday. He said it is time for Christians in the state to unite to defend their faith in the face of evil, and quest to intimidate the people back into idolatry. He said: “The last institution those causing mayhem in the state want to exterminate is the church, but they will not succeed. “Anambra is a Christian state, and will never succumb to idolatry.” There has been a resurgence of traditionalists in the state recently, with many youths resorting to fetish practices that have long been abandoned by their forefathers. Soludo had earlier stated in a statewide broadcast that part of the strategy of the criminals was to instill fear in people, through traditional religious practices, which involve swearing people to oaths, and human sacrifices. Soludo addressing the church however stated that following his recent declaration of state of emergency on criminal elements operating in the state, security forces are already taking the war squarely to the hideouts of those terrorizing the state, and most have been arrested. “The quest to secure Anambra State is a collective fight. I urge ndi Anambra to report activities of those who have seen criminality in the state as a lucrative enterprise. “Despite scanty resources, we are determined to give ndi Anambra a state to be proud of,” Soludo assured.
