The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has released former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mrs Patricia Olubunmi Etteh on bail. She was released Friday night after fulfilling bail conditions offered her by investigators working on her case. EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, in a statement, said the former Speaker is to report periodically to the agency to assist with further investigations. Recall that she was arrested on 17th May over suspicious and shady financial involvement with Phil Jin Projects Limited. Reports had it that Phil Jin Projects Limited was granted a contract by the NDDC for the supply of solar-powered street lights in some communities in Akwa Ibom. The company received N287m, even though the contract was worth N240m. Phil Jin Project Ltd later paid N130m to Patricia Etteh. The anti-graft Agency is investigating to find out why the ex-minister received the money when she is not a director of the company.
