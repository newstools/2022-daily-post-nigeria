Yusuf Ibrahim Zailani explained that fasting in the month of Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam aimed at strengthening our faith through spiritual engagements. He expressed his serious concerns over the skyrocketing prices of food and consumables in the country, appealing to the government to stem the tide of inflation while urging traders to desist from arbitrarily increasing the price of food items. He appealed to Muslims to continue to exercise patience and restraint in the interest of peace and national development, in spite of the ceaseless provocations received from those who ought to be their partners in faith.
