Following the emergence of the former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, as the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, has said the outcome of the exercise had been predicted. Pastor Giwa said the plan from the onset by northerners had been that Atiku should succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. The Pastor had a few weeks ago stated that the ploy by northerners was for a northerner to succeed Buhari who is also a northerner. He maintained that part of the grand plan for the move to materialise was the reason behind the deletion of the social media post which condemned the killing of Debora Samuel for blasphemy. Giwa added that it will be difficult for the southern part of the country to plan any upset against Abubakar. Abubakar had on Saturday emerged as the candidate of the party after defeating his main rival, Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State.
