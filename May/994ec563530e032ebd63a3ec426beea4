Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti, has given his verdicts on Erling Haaland’s move to Manchester City from Borussia Dortmund. Man City had on Tuesday announced that they had agreed to a deal with Dortmund for Haaland, with Real Madrid rumoured to have missed out on signing the 21-year-old. Pep Guardiola’s side exercised the €60 million release clause in Haaland’s contract. The deal represents a real coup for the Premier League champions, with Haaland being one of the most sought-after players in world football. The Norway international has scored 85 goals in 88 games for Dortmund since joining them in January 2020. Speaking during a press conference (as per Marca), Ancelotti refused to be dragged into a conversation about Haaland but admitted that he is a great player. The Italian said: “Ugh, I don’t really like to talk about this. “He’s a great player, City is a great club. I’m sticking with my squad, which has led me to enjoy another Champions League final.”
