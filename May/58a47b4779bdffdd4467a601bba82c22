A former Speaker of Imo State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Geoffrey Dikeocha has said that the APC in Imo State is likely to lose Owerri zone in the forthcoming elections going by its handling of the party’s affairs. He said the Imo State APC, led by Hon. MacDonald Ebere, has not done enough to galvanize members of the party, especially the aspirants for various positions. The party chieftain stated this during the APC Owerri Zonal Stakeholders’ meeting, which was held on Thursday, at the party’s secretariat, Owerri, that ended in almost a commotion. He harped on the likelihood of the party losing if it fails to provide a level playing ground for both members and aspirants. The former Speaker regretted that some people were working to hijack the party’s structure to favour their individual interests or supporters. Dikeocha said,” I want to state it categorically that our party, the APC may lose the Owerri zone going by the way the affairs of our party are piloted. “We should realize that the Owerri zone comprises nine local government areas. We should not make the mistake of losing it all. “I am saying this today because it is becoming obvious, and I tell you that if the party fails to provide a level playing ground for both members and aspirants, it is going to be a colossal loss for our party. “I am the Director General of Prince Alex Mbata Campaign Organization, and I know what I am talking about. My principal has been supportive to our party, the APC, both financially and otherwise. And we shall continue to show our unalloyed support. Let us do the right thing in order not to lose the Owerri zone.” But reacting to the former Speaker’s outburst, the State APC chairman, Hon. MacDonald Ebere said that no aspirant had so far been adopted and that the party had made it clear that the aspirants will test their popularity and acceptability at the primaries. He faulted the statement that the APC would lose in Owerri, insisting that the zone belonged to the ruling party.
