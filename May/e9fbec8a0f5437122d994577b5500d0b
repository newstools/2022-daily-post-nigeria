Footage showing the so-called “unknown gunmen” (UGM) parading a market in Abia State is trending. In the video, reportedly taken on Wednesday, about 50 armed men marched through the Ariaria Market in Aba. They all covered their faces, bearing weapons including AK-47s, shotguns, machetes, axes, knives and charms. The gang were said to have warned the traders that they would unleash violence if the sit-at-home directive was not complied with. DAILY POST gathered that the UGM had listed a number of days in May which people must not come out. They include Mondays, Nnamdi Kanu court days (17, 18, 26), Children’s Day (27), Inauguration Day on 29th (formerly Democracy Day), and Biafra Day (30). The military insists UGM are the same as Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its armed affiliate Eastern Security Network (ESN). On Tuesday, the Nigerian Army said IPOB ESN members killed two soldiers in Imo State last Saturday. A statement by Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu identified the victims as retired Master Warrant Officer (MWO) Audu Linus and Private Gloria Matthew. The couple were in transit for their traditional wedding when they were ambushed, tortured and beheaded. Nwachukwu said their murder portends “the deep seated hate, desperation and lawlessness with which foot soldiers of IPOB/ESN have been unleashing terror on Ndigbo”. The General added that the act “clearly depicts callousness, impenitence and is indisputably, a brazen act of terrorism perpetrated by IPOB/ESN”. Video:
