Dutch columnist, Sjoerd Mossou has tipped Cyriel Dessers to become a cult hero at Eredivisie side Feyenoord Rotterdam. Dessers linked up with Feyenoord from Belgian Pro League outfit KRC Genk on a season-long deal last summer. The Nigerian has been a revelation at De Kuip with 10 goals in the UEFA Europa Conference League. The 27-year-old has registered 16 goals in 36 appearances across all competitions for Arne Slot’s side. “A player who can effortlessly be added to the Kindvall-Van Hooijdonk-Pellè list. It now seems inconceivable that Dessers will walk out after this season, especially because his transfer fee of 4 million euros is relatively low for a striker. The return of the last few months gives the appearance of an outright bargain: his goals probably already brought in significantly more than his asking price.” Mossou wrote in his column. With Feyenoord struggling to cough out Genk’s modest €4m asking price, fans have started crowdfunding but FIFA statutes are against it. The club has however reached out to the business community to help fund the move and some businessmen have signified interest in sponsoring the move.
