Real Madrid star Karim Benzema has said that Kylian Mbappe’s decision to snub Spanish giants will not affect their relationship. Benzema also said he ‘respects’ Mbappe’s decision to remain at PSG. Mbappe scored 28 goals to help PSG win the Ligue 1 title this season and it was almost certain the 23-year-old was moving to Spain until a sudden change of mind last week. Real were furious with Mbappe’s decision and Benzema did not seem best pleased either. Benzema now addressed Mbappe’s matter after Real.Madrid’s 1-0 win over Liverpool that handed them the Champions League glory on Saturday. “I would have liked him to have been able to fulfil his dream of playing for Real Madrid, being together,’ Benzema told Telefoot. “He chose PSG, we must respect him. It’s his choice, he has a lot of responsibilities. “We will enjoy playing together in the national team. Everyone makes their own choices. “Real Madrid are Real Madrid, I’m not disappointed. We are good friends, it won’t affect our relationship.”
