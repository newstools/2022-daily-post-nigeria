Brazilian defender, Marcelo has been removed from Lyon’s dressing room for excessive farting and laughing. The club, in a statement said Marcelo was removed for a behavior not very well accepted by his teammates and the coaching staff. The French media report that the Brazilian entered the team’s locker room farting and also had a fit of laughter. And Gary Lineker, a former England star, has frowned on the club’s decision, saying that ‘football is gone’ if a player could be sanctioned merely for farting and laughing. Lyon’s management, in a statement, tried to explain the situation in the best possible way. The Brazilian was removed from the main squad and sent to the second team for “farting in the locker room and laughing about it with his teammates.” Marcelo, 34, was dropped from the starting lineup earlier in the season after an “incident in the dressing room,” according to the club. He was later ordered to move to the reserve squad at the Les Gones ground with immediate effect. The embarrassing incident happened after Lyon’s 3-0 loss to Angers in August 2021, in which Marcelo scored an own goal. Shortly after, the club’s social networks confirmed in a statement that following discussions with the boardroom and coach Peter Bosz, the Brazilian defender would be dropped. Gary Lineker, former England star, wrote on Twitter: “Taking him out of the team for farting? Nowadays I’d be banned for life for shitting on a pitch. The game is gone.”
