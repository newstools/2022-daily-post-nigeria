Ahead of the gubernatorial primary in Ogun state, the leadership of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) Joint Campus Committee (JCC) Ogun State chapter and the National Association of Ogun State Students (NAOS), have disassociated themselves from an alleged petition and protest last week, purportedly held by “sponsored students” against the Executive Governor of Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun at All Progressives Congress Secretariat, Abuja. The students in a statement jointly signed by Comrade Damilola Kehinde Chairman, NANS JCC Ogun, and Comrade Ogunrombi Oluwagbemileke President, National Association of Ogun State Students, condemned the activities of some political leaders in Ogun, aimed at unnecessarily heating up the political atmosphere in the state. They lamented that it was highly disheartening that people who are supposed to be in the position of elder statesmen in the state would be those responsible for sponsoring campaigns of calumny against the sitting state governor. The statement read: “We wish to use this medium to condemn the activities of some of our political leaders in the state aimed at unnecessarily heating up the political atmosphere in our dear state by sponsoring unwarranted and frivolous petition and against His Excellency Governor Dapo Abiodun, the Executive Governor of Ogun State through their faceless errand boys christened Coalition of Ogun State. “It is highly disheartening that people who are supposed to be elder statesmen in the state will be sponsoring campaigns of calumny against the sitting state governor. “This unwarranted sponsored media engagement aimed at His Excellency, Governor Dapo Abiodun is a high level show of irresponsibility on the part of the leaders who are sponsoring it. “Though there were several attempts by these leaders through their representatives and surrogate to recruit the leadership of all youth and students organisations in the state to join them in this ungodly venture but when this failed, they now resorted to mobilising Almajiris to stage protest against His Excellency, Governor Dapo Abiodun in the National Secretariat of All Progressives Congress in Abuja all in the bid to achieve their selfish end. “As the legitimate and recognised students body in Ogun State, the leadership of National Association of Nigerian Students NANS, Joint Campus Committee (JCC) Ogun axis and National Association of Ogun State Students (NAOS) will resist any attempt or calculated attempts by any political leader no matter how highly placed to use our platforms to aid any political tension in Ogun state. “May we use this opportunity to call on these leaders to stop fanning the ember of discord and instigating crisis within the youth and students community in the state by calling their errand boys to order because we will not fold our arms anymore and watch any faceless or self-acclaimed group to be misrepresenting us as students and young people in Ogun State. “We implore these leaders to join our amiable governor in his continued efforts in making our state the hub of industrial revolution and socio-economic development in Nigeria,” the students stated.
