The lawmaker representing Oyo South senatorial district, Dr. Muhammad Kola Balogun has dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Balogun, who is the younger brother to the current Olubadan of Ibadan land, Oba Lekan Balogun made this disclosure Monday night. The lawmaker was elected on the platform of the PDP in 2019. He was the only Senator elected on the platform of PDP in the State in 2019 after he defeated the immediate past governor, late Abiola Ajimobi and other candidates. He was, however, reportedly denied a second term ticket in the party, prompting a move away from the PDP. The lawmaker announced he was dumping his party in a letter addressed to the chairman of the party in Ward 12, Ibadan North-East Local Government Area. The lawmaker, in a statement signed by his Media Aide, Dapo Falade, added that his resignation letter was acknowledged by the PDP Ward Chairman, Tijani Wasiu, on the 29th of April 2022. He said his resignation took effect on 28 April, 2022. The lawmaker in the statement made available to DAILY POST said, “I, Senator Dr. Kola Balogun, Senator presently representing Oyo South Senatorial District at the 9th Senate, Federal Republic of Nigeria, Abuja, hereby tender my membership resignation from the Peoples Democratic Party of Nigeria, with effect from today 28th April 2022. “I thank the party for giving me the opportunity to serve my people in the capacity of a Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and your cooperation which I enjoyed till the month of April 2022”.
