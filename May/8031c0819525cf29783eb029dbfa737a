Three people were feared killed in a fresh bloody cult clash in Ilorin, Kwara State capital on Monday night. The three victims included one Hausa commercial Okada rider and two suspected cultists yet to be identified. DAILY POST reports that the clash occurred at about 8.40pm around Omoda roundabout in Ilorin metropolis. Eyewitness accounts said confusion broke out in the area when the suspected cultists started shooting sporadically, forcing people to scamper for safety. Business and social activities were abruptly put on hold for the night in the area, as people closed their shops and deserted the area to avoid being hit by stray bullets and possible attack from the cultists. Efforts to get confirmation from the spokesperson of the State police command, Mr Okasanmi Ajayi, in Ilorin, proved abortive as text messages sent to him on the incident were not replied. DAILY POST recalls that a gang of boys led by Habeeb Ganiyu, last Friday stabbed two young boys to death at Adifa and Centre Igboro area of Ilorin metropolis. The two victims identified as Lukman and Kudus, were confirmed dead by doctors on duty at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, UITH Ilorin where they were rushed to. Habeeb, who allegedly stabbed them in the chest, had been arrested by the police. Also, on Sunday night, suspected cultists struck at a residence near the playing field of the Government Day Secondary School, Kulende-Zango quarters of Ilorin during which sporadic gunshots were heard.
