Ahead of the political parties’ primaries, the Nigerian Senate has adjourned plenary till June 7, 2022. The shutdown was to enable the lawmakers participate fully in the Presidential, national assembly, governorship, and state houses of assembly primaries holding across the month of May. The Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi, moved the motion for adjournment and was seconded by the Deputy Minority Leader, Shuaibu Lau. The Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, in his remarks, moments before the close of plenary on Wednesday, explained that it is very important that the lawmakers participate fully in activities and processes leading to the conduct of party primaries for the various elective positions ahead of the 2023 general elections as some of them are also aspiring for various offices. He said processing of forms for the House of Representatives and Senate has started and the lawmakers are expected to submit their completed forms on Thursday. “It is very important that we participate in the process that affects us directly, as well as those that do not affect us directly – that is the State Houses of Assembly, Governorship and Presidential. “Consequently, we have to adjourn to enable us participate fully in all these activities because we are supposed to be active participants. So, I wish all of us the best of luck,” Lawan said. It would be recalled that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), in a Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2023 General Elections released on 26th February, 2022, directed political parties to conduct their primaries for the nomination of candidates from the 4th April to 3rd of June, 2022. INEC, in a statement issued by its National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voters Education Committee, Festus Okoye, on 5th May, 2022, warned political parties in the country that it would not extend the ultimatum, stressing that the Friday 3rd June 2022 deadline “is firm and fixed”.
