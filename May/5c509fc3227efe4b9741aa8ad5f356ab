The House of Representatives on Monday announced that resumption of plenary has been postponed to June 7. This is as a result of the ongoing party primaries across Nigeria. The announcement was contained in a statement issued by the Clerk of the House, Dr Yahaya Danzaria, on Monday in Abuja. The House adjourned sitting to May 23, to enable members participate in primaries after an emergency sitting on May 11. The terse statement read: “I’m directed to inform all Honourable Members, staff, media and the general public that due to the ongoing party primaries ,the House will resume plenary on Tuesday, June 7, at 11am.”
