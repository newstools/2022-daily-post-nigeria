Manchester United striker, Edinson Cavani, has admitted he would have left the club if he knew they were planning to re-sign Cristiano Ronaldo. United finalized the transfer for Ronaldo in the closing stages of the summer transfer window in a £19.8million deal. While Cavani has hailed the 37-year-old as a “great professional”, he has now confessed he would have left if the deal was completed earlier. “Speaking the truth, as I always tell the truth, as it should be, at the moment it happened, I thought it was good that Manchester signed Cristiano. “Knowing a little about the world of football today, the first thing I did was call my brother and I said, ‘Fernando, if this had happened a week ago, I would have asked you to sign with another club’,” Cavani told ESPN’s Bola da Vez.
