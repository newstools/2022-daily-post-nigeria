Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode has revealed some characters of Nigerians which according to him, have had a long-term effect on the country. In a statement he signed and titled: “Bitter Truth About Nigerians”, the human rights lawyer accused Nigerians of being in support of negative happenings at the detriment of the acceptable standards. According to the All Progressives Congress, APC chieftain, Nigerians hate the loving, the kind, the honest, the prudent and the righteous but love the hateful, the cruel, the corrupt, the reckless and the depraved. He said, “They regard deliverers and gallant men of courage, fortitude and vision as vain fools and they see cruel oppressors as great and worthy heroes. “They love the sensual and the sedentary and they worship money whilst they have contempt for those who place more value on discipline, restraint, holiness, virtue, honesty and decency. “They place no value on education or the educated but place all value on those that flaunt cash and worship money. “They build mega churches which refuse to cater for the poor and they go there to ask God for prosperity and promotion instead of love and salvation. “They condone Pastors that offer round-trips to heaven for 310,000 naira and they tolerate Sheiks that promote, protect, defend and pamper bloodthirsty terrorists and heartless kidnappers. “They take pleasure in young and misguided sexual deviants, filthy reprobates and ageing harlots who sleep with dogs and donkeys in the closet of their bedrooms and who eat the faeces of strange men in far away Dubai”.
