Atiku Abubakar, a presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has denied reports making the rounds that he was snubbed by Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State during his consultation visit to the state over the weekend. Despite images of the 2019 presidential candidate and Makinde on social media, reports suggested that Atiku, who was on a tour of the Southwest to meet with party delegates ahead of the party’s primary elections did not get to meet the Oyo State Governor. Makinde was said to have shunned Atiku Abubakar, despite the itinerary showing he was to meet with him after departing Abeokuta, Ogun State. Atiku met with delegates in Lagos State on Friday after meeting Chief Olabode George at his Ikoyi office and proceeded with his journey when he met with Ogun State delegates in Abeokuta. The former Vice President reportedly could not meet Makinde in spite of the fact that journalists had been informed to be on standby for the meeting. But in reaction to the report, Paul Ibe, Atiku’s Senior Special Adviser on Media, said, “Media reports that Gov @seyiamakinde shunned H.E @atiku during his consultative tour of Oyo State are not true. “The two leaders met Sunday morning before Atiku’s departure to Osogbo, and they had a good meeting focused on building unity for both @OfficialPDPNig and Nigeria.”
