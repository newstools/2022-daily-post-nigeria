Amid the debates over the zoning of the presidential tickets within some political parties ahead of the general elections, Senator Ali Ndume, the lawmaker representing Borno South District, has given a reason why northern politicians should support a southerner to take over from President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. Ndume said if the President comes from the southern region of Nigeria, the northerners will benefit more, citing an example during former President Goodluck Jonathan’s administration. He spoke on Tuesday while featuring on Channels Television’s Politics Today. Ndume said, “Personally, I feel we will be better off with the President coming from the South. “The current President comes from the North and if you look at it analytically, the South benefitted more. “If the President comes from the South, we’ll benefit more – just as we did previously during (former President Goodluck) Jonathan’s (administration). “It pays the South when there is a northern President.”
