Former Tottenham striker, Darren Bent has warned Erling Haaland over his transfer to Manchester City. Haalaand, 21, has reportedly undergone a medical at the Etihad and ‘a deal in principle’ has already been confirmed by the club. However, Bent noted that City boss, Pep Guardiola’s track record with strikers could make the move interesting. Haaland has scored 85 goals in 88 games for Borussia Dortmund but Guardiola prefers a more fluid attacking line and this has raised questions over where the Norwegian would fit into the Manchester City side. Bent said that there is more than enough evidence to suggest that the 21-year-old might not get things all his own way if a move is finalised. Speaking to talkSPORT, Bent said: “It’ll be interesting to see the dynamic between him and Pep [Guardiola]. “When you look at Pep and centre-forwards, I know he had Lionel Messi, but the only one that he’s had and it’s worked is Lewandowski at Bayern. “Zlatan [Ibrahimovic] at Barcelona and that didn’t quite work, he had David Villa at Barcelona but he put him out wide and even towards the end with [Sergio] Aguero he phased him out. “So I’m not sure how Pep wants to work with a centre forward. This is not a centre forward who can work wide right and wide left, he is an out and out number nine. “I think it gives City a huge advantage because you’re talking about a guy who scores goals every single time he steps onto a football pitch, but I’m really interested to see how Pep is going to use him.”
