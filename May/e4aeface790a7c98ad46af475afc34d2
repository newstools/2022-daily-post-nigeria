Governor Darius Dickson Ishaku of Taraba State, on Monday, ordered the immediate suspension of recruitment into the state civil service. The announcement, as noticed by DAILY POST, was contained in a statement made available to newsmen in Jalingo by the governor’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Bala Dan Abu. According to the statement, “Governor Darius Dickson Ishaku wishes to state that the list of appointees recently released by the State Civil Service Commission (CSC) does not have his approval.” The governor’s decision to put hold on the exercise, according to the statement, was to allow for comprehensive investigation and re-dressing of all the anomalies complained of. It would be recalled that over 2,000 applicants were recently recruited into the state civil service by the Governor Ishaku-led administration. Apart from the recruitment, letters of employment, as noticed by DAILY POST, were also observed to have been personally distributed to the applicants at the Jolly Nyame Stadium by the governor. Aside from the aforementioned, the Chairman of the state’s Civil Service Commission (CSC), John Mamman, was also noticed to have applauded the governor for “bringing in young and vibrant officers into the state civil service for continuity and effective service delivery.” He said the screening and employment were done based on the principle of equal representation, reflecting state character as embedded in the federal character. The decision of the governor to suspend the recruitment which he earlier adjudged as one of the best recruitment exercises carried out in the state, was observed to have not gone down well with the successful applicants.
