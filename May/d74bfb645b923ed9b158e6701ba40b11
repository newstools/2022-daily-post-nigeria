Peoples Democratic Party, PDP in Ekiti State has mocked the state Governor, Kayode Fayemi over his recent promise to end insurgency and banditry in the country, particularly in the Northeast. In a statement on Monday, the party described the governor’s promise as an empty boast that signifies nothing, saying he should have tested his ability in the state. The state’s Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Raphael Adeyanju who issued the statement in Ado Ekiti, said charity should begin at home. Governor Fayemi, a presidential aspirant under the platform of the All Progressives Congress, APC, had, during his interaction with delegates in Borno and Yobe states, boasted that he has the ability to restore security, end insurgency and banditry in the entire Northeast. The statement reads, “How does Fayemi hope to secure any part of the country when he had failed woefully to secure Ekiti State, especially his home town which has been turned into the headquarters of bandits and kidnappers in the country? “When Ekiti State residents can no longer sleep with their eyes closed. When most of the roads have been taken over by bandits, who are kidnapping people at will.” The main opposition party warned Nigerians against being deceived by politicians looking for ways to win elections.
