Shehu Sani, former Kaduna lawmaker has spoken on the alarming trend of ladies allegedly sleeping with dogs for money. Social media has been filled with unpleasant videos of ladies having sexual intercourse with dogs in the past few days. Force spokesman, CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, reacting to the development, cited the Criminal code Act, 1990, which states that it’s an offence for anyone to have carnal knowledge of an animal. Speaking on the issue of bestiality, which has continued to stir reactions, Sani said it is immoral for human beings to sleep with a dog. He noted that such act deserved serious punishment. His tweet read: “It’s immoral for human beings to sleep with a dog or human beings copying the ways of the dog while sleeping. “They deserve serious punishment.”
