Paris Saint-Germain forward, Kylian Mbappe, has revealed the club he would like to play for in the Italian Serie A. Mbappe, who recently signed a new three-year deal to remain at PSG after snubbing a move to Real Madrid, said he would like to play for AC Milan in the Italian top flight. The France international admitted that he normally watches AC Milan matches. This is coming after AC Milan won the Serie A title on Sunday after beating Sassuolo 3-0. Speaking to La Gazzetta dello Sport, Mbappe said, “My bond with Milan is special. As a child I had an Italian babysitter and I spent a lot of time with her family and they are all AC Milan fans. So thanks to them, I also cheered for Milan and I watched many of their games.” Mbappe added, “I always said: if I play in Italy it will only be at Milan. On the other hand, if I had said otherwise, they would have killed me… But seriously, I can only congratulate them on the Scudetto won by Milan, with many French friends and Ibrahimovic, a legend that I respect a lot.”
