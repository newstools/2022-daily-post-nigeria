Ahead of the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential primaries, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has held a closed door meeting with delegates from Niger State. DAILY POST gathered that the meeting lasted over two hours. At the meeting with the delegates in Minna, journalists were barred from coverage. Osibanjo’s chopper touched the Minna Polo Ground at about 4 pm and he immediately headed first to the Palace of the Emir of Minna, Dr. Farouk Bahago, where he held a meeting behind closed doors before going to the Niger State Government house to meet with the delegates. Before the arrival of the VP, his Political Adviser, Senator Femi Ojudu had told the delegates that the Vice President takes them as partners in progress and not followers. Ojudu explained to the delegates that arrangements have been made for all delegates to make them comfortable and at ease during the presidential primaries. According to him, “We have made hotel accommodations for you before you leave. When you get to Abuja, you will be given your room and everyone will have a room to himself or herself.” “Everything will be orderly. Everyone will be doing his or her assignment and you will be happy about it,” Ojudu told the delegates. Furthermore, on the reason why journalists were barred from the meeting, the political adviser said, “the delegates would be given an opportunity to ask questions which the VP would like to give frank answers and he may not want to be in the media.”
