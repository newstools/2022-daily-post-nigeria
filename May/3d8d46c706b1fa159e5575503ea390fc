Manchester United forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, has been named the Premier League’s Player of the Month for April. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner wins the prize ahead of Manchester City’s Kevin De Bruyne. The Portugal captain scored five times in just four matches for the Red Devils. Ronaldo had won the same prize last September ahead of Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah. The honour is made even more impressive as Ronaldo missed Man United’s heavy 4-0 defeat to Liverpool due to special leave. Ronaldo missed that match due to grieving over the tragic death of his newborn son. The latest award now moves Ronaldo to within one of the Premier League record of seven, which is held by Tottenham’s Harry Kane, and Manchester City legend Sergio Aguero. In the month of April, Ronaldo scored his 100th Premier League goal in a 3-1 defeat at Arsenal, while he also registered his 50th club hat-trick in a 3-2 win over Norwich City. Ronaldo netted his fifth goal of the month, equalising to earn a 1-1 draw with Chelsea. Other contenders for the prize were Nathan Collins, Kevin De Bruyne, Bruno Guimarães, Gabriel Jesus, Son Heung-min, Thiago and Leandro Trossard.
