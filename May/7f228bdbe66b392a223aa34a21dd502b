Finnish President, Sauli Niinistö, has revealed that Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin reacted calmly when his country told him of its decision to apply for NATO membership, a US-led military alliance, amid the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Niinistö made this known during an interview with CNN, while speaking on Finland’s plan to join NATO. “Actually, the surprise was that he [Putin] took it so calmly,” Niinistö said. “But in security policy, especially talking with Russia, you have to keep in mind that what he said doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t be all the time quite well aware.” “But so far, it seems that there’s no immediate problems coming,” he added. Meanwhile, Russia has already cut off its ten per cent electricity supply to Finland following its plan to join NATO. Putin had kicked against such a move, saying, “such a change in the country’s political orientation can have a negative impact on Russian-Finnish relations developed over the years in a spirit of good neighbourliness and cooperation between partners.”
