Chief Ralph Uwazuruike, the founder of the Movement for the Actualisation of Sovereign State of Biafra, MASSOB, and Biafra Independence Movement, BIM, has downplayed the call for a Nigerian President of Igbo extraction. Uwazuruike said he doesn’t believe in the idea of Igbo Presidency, stressing that such should be discarded. He asserted this while hosting Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State and a Presidential aspirant of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Owerri, Imo State on Saturday, NAN reports. The MASSOB founder said the race for who becomes Nigeria’s next president should be thrown open. Uwazuruike urged Nigerians to shun zoning because it had no place in the country’s constitution. According to Uwazuruike, zoning leads to sectionalism of some regions of the country. He said: “I don’t believe in the idea of zoning system or Igbo president because zoning means sectionalism. “If we want to talk about Nigeria, we must throw the presidential contest open but if you throw it open, it must be for the youths not elders, because the elders have failed us.”
