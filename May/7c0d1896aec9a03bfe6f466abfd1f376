Russian Defense Minister, Sergei Shoigu has warned that Russian forces would destroy any war equipment being transported into Ukraine by NATO and United States. The minister said this on a conference call in Moscow as reported by the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. He repeated the warning that it will consider NATO equipment arriving in Ukraine as a legitimate target, according to RIA Novosti, as quoted by CNN. This latest warning came after Russian cruise missiles hit several locations Tuesday in western and central Ukraine, which Ukrainian officials said were an attempt to destroy the country’s transport infrastructure. Shoigu warned that NATO vehicles with weapons and ammunition for Ukrainian troops will be destroyed in the country. “The United States and its NATO allies continue to pump weapons to Ukraine,” Shoigu said. “I note that any transport of the North Atlantic Alliance that arrived on the territory of the country with weapons or materiel for the needs of the Ukrainian armed forces is considered by us as a legitimate target for destruction.”
