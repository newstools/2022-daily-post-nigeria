A former Aviation Minister, Mbazulike Amaechi has slammed Senate Chief Whip, Orji Kalu, for endorsing the Presidential candidacy of the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan. Amaechi said Kalu is not relevant to the 2023 Presidential aspiration of the South-East. Recently, Kalu withdrew from the All Progressives Congress, APC, Presidential race and backed Lawan’s ambition. The former Abia State Governor said he decided to withdraw from the race because APC has no zoning arrangement. Reacting to the development, Amaechi said the likes of Orji Kalu can’t make any difference to the pursuit of a Nigerian President of Igbo extraction. “Orji Uzor Kalu and his likes have the right to support anybody they want to support for the President of Nigeria in the 2023 Presidential election. They are, however, not so relevant in Igbo land; they can’t make any difference. “If such people who have no relevance in South-East are saying otherwise to the demand of their people, how do you blame them? They cannot make any difference and so nobody should lose sleep about their actions and utterances, you may not even know what their plans are,” he told Vanguard.
