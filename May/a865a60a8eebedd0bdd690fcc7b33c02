Presidential aspirant and former Governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress, APC, says he is the only one in the race for the party’s presidential ticket. Tinubu said he’s not bothered by the number of those aspiring for the APC sole ticket, ahead of the party’s primaries. The APC leader, who stated this during a visit to the Niger State Governor, Alh Abubakar Sani Bello, in Minna, Niger State, said he is the only contestant among all that knows how to bring Nigeria out of its current predicaments. “If they ask you to follow them (other aspirants), ask them where? They don’t know the road. I am the only person who knows the road. The only person you should follow is me. I won’t mislead you, they don’t have my brain. I am the smartest of them all. “Everytime they keep saying, I am not well, I have travelled for medical attention, I have gone to Mecca, and they don’t have medical certificates. They said, I have bad legs as if I am their grandfather. Yeye people,” the former governor fumed. Tinubu noted that as a bridge builder, he has raised politicians who later became state governors, senators, House of Representatives and state house of assembly members in the country. According to him, “They are all pointing accusing fingers at the wrong person. They are talking, the question is, how many counsellors, house of assembly members, state governors, senators and House of Representatives members have they produced? I alone have produced them all in this country.” Responding, the Niger State Governor asked the state delegates if they would support the aspiration of Asiwaju Tinubu, they all answered “yes, we support him”. Bello then added that on that note, he has nothing further to say on the matter.
