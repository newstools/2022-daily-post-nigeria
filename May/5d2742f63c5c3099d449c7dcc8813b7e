Incoming Manchester United manager, Erik ten Hag, has revealed that his first target at Old Trafford next season is Champions League qualification. Ten Hag, who is taking over from interim boss Ralf Rangnick, was unveiled by Manchester United to the press on Monday. The Dutchman also said that he is determined to get Manchester United challenging for titles next season. Recall that Man United finished outside of the Premier League top four this season. The Red Devils will now play in the Europa League next season. “I said this is the project to bring Man United back on top, but also we have to accept the current situation we are in,” Ten Hag said during his press conference. “First of all, Man United belongs in the Champions League, so that will be the first target.” He added, “Important (to win silverware). “For me, every game is important. We want to win every game, and that has to be the attitude from everyone. Players but also staff and all the other ones in the club.”
