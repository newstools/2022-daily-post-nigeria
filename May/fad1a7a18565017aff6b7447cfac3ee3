Governor Umar Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has refused to endorse the presidential aspiration of Rotimi Amaechi, former Minister of Transportation. Amaechi, who was in Kano for his presidential campaign and also to meet with delegates of the All Progressives Congress (APC) delegates ahead of the primary elections of the party, told Ganduje, “I know your position as far as our party presidential candidature is concerned, and I want you to change for me”. However, Ganduje, believed to be supporting Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s ambition, told him, “Kano is a swing state and we will continue to swing until the end, so try and be part of the swings”. However, Ganduje commended Amaechi for his endearing efforts in standing with the APC and fighting for it in the wee hours of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidency. He said, “We are aware how you suffered for our party at the mega movement of its formation, as DG Buhari Campaign Director, we knew how you were harrassed as Governor of Rivers State and how you were at a time denied from flying out from Kano which made you travel to Abuja by road.”
