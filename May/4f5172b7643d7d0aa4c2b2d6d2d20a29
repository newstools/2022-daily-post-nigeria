Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, a former presidential aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has urged any aspirant that wins the party primaries to consider forming a government of national unity if he emerges President. He said this in a statement released by his media office in Abuja on Wednesday. The APC has 25 aspirants hoping to fly the party’s flag in the 2023 general election. Olawepo-Hashim was, until last week, one of them. He added that the government must also be tasked to “secure the nation and bring immediate relief to our suffering people whose welfare have been battered due to the Energy crises coming just at the heels of economic crises occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic.” According to him, Nigeria requires “a patriotic, and non-partisan approach to navigate its current existential crises, as it happened during and after the Nigeria civil war in 1970.” Last Wednesday, at its meeting at Isanya-Ogbo, Ogun State, leaders of the Afenifere, the Pan-Yoruba socio-political group, equally reiterated the call for a government of national unity ahead of the 2023 general elections saying it will help tackle the insecurity problems in the country and “midwife a new democratic government.”
