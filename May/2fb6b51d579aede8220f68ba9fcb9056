Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode has expressed optimism that the prime suspect in the killing of Deborah Samuel will pay a terrible price wherever he may be. This followed reports that the suspect, who admitted in a viral video that he burnt the 200-level student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto alive, is from Niger Republic and has disappeared from Nigeria. In a post on his verified Facebook page, Fani-Kayode prayed that the finger of God would find the suspect wherever he is. He wrote, “The beast who killed Deborah and burnt her body to ashes is from Niger Republic and he has fled there. “Yet even if he hides in the deepest recesses of the ocean or under the foundations of the highest mountain, the finger of God will seek him out for destruction and he will be brought to justice! “He will not know peace for his callous and brutal actions and he will pay a terrible price for his brutal and heartless crime both in this life and in the next. So it shall be”.
