Outgoing Manchester United interim coach, Ralf Rangnick has said that it makes sense for incoming permanent manager, Erik ten Hag to give a number of the Red Devils’ youngsters the chance to impress in the first team during pre-season. Rangnick said this ahead of Man United’s Premier League final day fixture against Crystal Palace on Sunday. Ten Hag will take over from Rangnick once the 2021/22 season is over, with the Dutchman due at Selhurst Park to watch the team in their final match of the campaign against Crystal Palace. He is then set to meet the players on Monday, ahead of an expected overhaul of the squad this summer. When asked if some of the youngsters he has brought through are ready or need further development, Rangnick said at his pre-match press conference: “Not all of them. But there may be one or two, or even three, where it makes sense to have them in pre-season so that they can show to Erik if they are ready to play. “On the other hand, for an 18/19-year-old to be here and not play or get enough game time, it may also make sense for them to go out on loan like [James] Garner did at Nottingham Forest or like quite a few other players did with other clubs. “This could also be an option and whilst there are quite a few players, Hannibal and of course [Alejandro] Garnacho have already had their debuts, it is also about game time and they need to play on the highest possible level regularly. “It is not only about training on the highest level like they do here but also they need to play at that level too.”
