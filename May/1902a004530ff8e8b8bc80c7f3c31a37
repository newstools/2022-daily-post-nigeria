The Transition Monitoring Group (TMG) has berated the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for altering the dates for 2023 election activities. The deadline for the conduct of primary elections and submission of nominated candidates was on Friday moved from the 4th to 9th of June. A statement by TMG chairman, Auwal Musa Rafsanjani noted that the extension was disturbing. He said at a time when Nigerians are beginning to have confidence in the electoral umpire, powerful forces are pressurizing it to do their biddings. The activist observed that a number of political platforms have made efforts to conduct their primaries. “If the ruling party is still uncertain about the day to conduct its presidential primary election, that shouldn’t be the basis for the extension.” TMG also condemned the cases of vote-buying at party primaries across the country. Rafsanjani told delegates that they don’t have to go to the extent of mortgaging Nigeria’s future for money. “They should think of Nigeria first before other considerations. The influence of money in an election has far-reaching implications.” The statement added that politicians who spend to be voted for will work towards recouping the funds eventually.
