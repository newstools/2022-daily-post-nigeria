An Islamic scholar, Sheikh Musa Lukwa has revealed why he led Muslims in Sokoto State in Eid Prayers on Sunday despite announcement by the Sultan of Sokoto, His Eminence, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar. DAILY POST reports that the Sultan on Saturday, announced in a statement by the Secretary of the National Moon Sighting Committee, NMSC, Mallam Yahaya Muhammad Boyi that first day of Shawwal would be observed on Monday following the inability of NMSC to sight Shawwal moon. However, it was learnt that some Muslims in Sokoto State ignored Sultan’s directive and held Eid Prayers on Sunday. Sheik Luka, who led the prayer, said the Sultan’s position was not correct, arguing that the moon was sighted in several places. He to Daily Trust that their decision followed the instruction of the Holy Prophet, alleging that the Sultan has disobeyed Allah and his Prophet (SAW) “A lecturer at the Usman Danfodiyo University, Dr. Maigari, also confirmed the sighting of the new moon at the main campus of the university and there were reports on the new moon from at least 10 communities in Jega, Kebbi State, which was confirmed by the Chief Imam of Jega, Malam Bashar. “Sheikh Dahiru of Bauchi State also confirmed the sighting of the new moon in many places in the country. “So, we observed our Eid in compliance with the instruction of the Holy Prophet who asked us to fast and to break the fast at the sighting of the new moon. It is agreed that, obedience to our leaders, especially, the Sultan, is compulsory for every Muslim but on condition that he did not disobey Allah and his Prophet, (SAW),” he said.
