Apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo has reacted angrily to the outcome of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential primary election which was held in Abuja on Saturday. DAILY POST reported that former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar emerged the winner of the election after polling a total of 371 votes as against 237 by votes by Governor Nyesom Wike. In a statement signed by the President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike he said the outcome of the convention was a huge insult on the collective sensibilities of Ndigbo. He said the continuous stay of the people of the South-East in the PDP was of no use, as their contributions had not been recognized by the party in any way. “We are saddened that despite the honest and justified appeal by Ndigbo that equity should be the guiding watch-word in the PDP presidential primary election, the party has shown that it has no regard for Ndigbo. “There is no doubt that across the country, only Ndigbo have followed and remained in the PDP since 1999, earning our people all manner of marginalization and attacks. “But what have we gotten in return? A slap on our face, a total rejection by the PDP. “It is only necessary that we now ask our people that this is the time to quit the PDP as it is now clear that we are not needed in that party. It is a party where injustice against Ndigbo thrives, a party that has refused to reward loyalty. “We await the presidential primary election of the All Progressives Congress, but for now, it is goodbye to PDP,” Okwu declared.
