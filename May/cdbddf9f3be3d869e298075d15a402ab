In a series of tweets, the presidential aspirant wrote: “The gruesome murder of Okechukwu Okoye, a member of the Anambra State House of Assembly and the abduction of his aide Chiegboka are utterly wicked and condemnable crimes. “The activities of so-called “Unknown Gunmen” in Southeast Nigeria constitute terrorism. SE is bleeding. “We must end this reign of terror. It remains the responsibility of @NigeriaGov which is responsible for security, to do so. Life has become so cheap in our country that a more fundamental, political leadership change must happen as soon as possible to restore our human dignity.”
