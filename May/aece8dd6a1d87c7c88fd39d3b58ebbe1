The United States has rejected the claims that the current outbreak of monkeypox originated from America. A statement by the US Embassy on Tuesday also said the country had no “U.S.-controlled laboratories” in Nigeria. There are calls on social media and elsewhere, urging the World Health Organization (WHO) to probe the global powerhouse. “There is zero merit to any allegations regarding the use of U.S.-assisted Nigerian laboratories in the spread of monkeypox”, the US maintains. The American government noted that the falsehoods were to detract its work with Nigerian and multilateral partners on disease surveillance, diagnosis, prevention and control. The statement said the collaboration with Nigeria has provided opportunities for technical assistance in capacity building, equipment, commodities/consumables, funding to critical public health programs, hospitals and laboratories. The U.S. reminded the public that monkeypox is not a new disease, nor unique to Nigeria or Africa, having first been diagnosed in 1970 in Congo. The government said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research Program have been supporting laboratories in the country with only technical assistance and funding. “These laboratories are Nigerian, and U.S. support enables them to provide essential services for the public good and the health of citizens.” America assures continued partnership with the Nigerian government on the monkeypox and COVID-19 outbreaks, as it was with HIV epidemic control, prevention of vaccine-preventable disease, food and nutrition, tuberculosis and malaria fight. —
