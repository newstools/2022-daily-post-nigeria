Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State and Presidential aspirant under the All Progressives Congress (APC) has criticised both the party and the Federal government, saying both need to change the way they do things. Fayemi, in Adamawa State on Tuesday, in continuation of his campaign tour, said the APC had failed in its reward system and that the security agencies, which the federal government supervises, should have raised their human capacities long ago. Fayemi, who addressed APC delegates at the City Green Hotel in Yola, spoke at length on how the APC was not getting it right with its reward system. He said, “The reward system is one of the problems with this party. Charity must begin at home. There are many people like us who have been part of the foundation of the party and have never left: people who were there at the birth of this party and have seen to it that this party must remain and must flourish.” Fayemi who did not mention APC members who deserved reward but did not get it, said the reward system in the APC should be commensurate with the work members have done. On insecurity, the presidential aspirant said, “Insecurity is a present danger for all of us and you need somebody who has the competence and experience to tackle it once and for all. “We are in a state of war, but it isn’t a conventional war, so you can’t use conventional means to stop it. We need alternative means to tackle insecurity,” he said. Hitting directly at the military and the police, Fayemi said, “Why is it so difficult to recruit people into the military and the police? The other day, the IGP and the Police Service Commission were quarreling over who has the power to recruit.”
