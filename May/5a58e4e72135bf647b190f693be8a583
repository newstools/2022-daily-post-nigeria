Former Board Chairman of Project Development Institute, PRODA, Comrade Dan Onjeh has clinched the ticket of the All Progressives Congress, APC, to run for the Benue South Senatorial district in 2023. He was declared winner of the ticket after beating other contestants in the just concluded primary election, which took place on Sunday. According to the result sheets obtained by DAILY POST, Onjeh defeated Austin Oleho, Ejeh Joseph, Joseph Ajene, and Nelson Alapa with a wide margin. Onjeh, who had contested for the same seat two times, would be facing the incumbent Senator, Abah Moro who recently secured his bid to represent the Idoma nation at the upper chamber for the second time via the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. DAILY POST had reported that thugs attempted disrupting the exercise in Otukpo, a political center of the constituency. The Chairman, APC, Electoral Committee for Benue South, Hon. Moses Mkeenem, had raised the alarm over the invasion of the election collation centre by hoodlums. Hon. Mkeenem alleged that the thugs believed to be loyal to one of the aspirants in the election invaded the premises, brandishing guns, machetes and other lethal weapons. The chairman consequently suspended the collation exercise to resume after enough security had been provided.
