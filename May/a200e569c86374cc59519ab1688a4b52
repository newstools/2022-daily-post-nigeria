Former Deputy Senate President and governorship aspirant in Enugu State has asked “all lovers of democracy” to shun the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, national delegates’ Congress scheduled for today, Monday. Ekweremadu, in a statement signed by his Campaign Director, alleged that the 3-man ad hoc delegates’ congress held earlier in the State was already a subject of litigation as it fell below guidelines. He said that “some interest groups are planning to use the concocted list of three-man delegates that is being challenged in court in the election of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National Delegates in Enugu today, the 10th day of May 2022.” He claimed that “those on that list never participated in the election of three-man delegates in Enugu State and where they participated, they lost.” “The Ikeoha Campaign Organisation, therefore, advises the PDP to refrain from impunity and allow the courts to adjudicate on the matter. Any such disrespect to the court process on the matter will have consequences on our primary elections. “In the circumstance, therefore, we urge the PDP to suspend the exercise of electing National Delegates in Enugu State today and await the court verdict regarding the three-man delegates. “We equally hereby advise all lovers of democracy and all those who have respect for our judiciary to shun today’s exercise,” he said. Meanwhile, DAILY POST earlier reported that the PDP Election Committee from Abuja had after conducting the 3-man delegates’ congress, in Enugu State, adjudged it to be peaceful and successful. A High Court in the State had also ordered the party to use the list of delegates produced from the exercise.
