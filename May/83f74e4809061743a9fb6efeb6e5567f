Chelsea attacking midfielder, Mason Mount has revealed he grew up idolizing Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo. Mount said he always watched Ronaldo very closely, adding that he loved the way he played his free kicks. “I think everyone has seen the video of when I was younger, basing my free kick off him [Cristiano Ronaldo],” Mount told Amazon Prime in an interview (via Football London). “I always watched him [Ronaldo] very closely when he was at [Manchester] United as a young kid. I loved the way he played, his free kicks.” He added, “So I always try to look at and work out, what can I do, to put it into my game? But now to play against him is the journey that you go on from watching someone in the stands as a fan and then to being on the same pitch and playing against them. “It is a crazy journey and yeah, that is why I love football so much.”
