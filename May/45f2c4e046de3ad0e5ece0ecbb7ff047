Chelsea legend, Pat Nevin, has hailed Super Eagles defender Calvin Bassey following his performance during the Rangers’ 2-0 win over Hearts in the final of the Scottish Cup on Saturday. Bassey’s performance this season is catching the attention of pundits and clubs in Europe. The left-back was phenomenal during Wednesday’s Europa League final against German Bundesliga side Eintracht Frankfurt and followed that up with another fine performance on Saturday. With 15 minutes to the final whistle, the defender came close to capping his fine performance with a goal but Hearts goalkeeper Craig Gordon made a fine save to deny him. And Nevin, who was on pundit duty with BBC Radio 5 Live said, “Bassey is clearly a player who is playing with bags of confidence right now. “He’s got the pace and power to drive down the line all day. “Three drag backs in a row from a full-back? That shouldn’t be allowed – that was phenomenal!”
