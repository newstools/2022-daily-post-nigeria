Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) have reportedly shortlisted five managers to replace Mauricio Pochettino. PSG is purportedly on the verge of parting ways with Pochettino and have identified about five managers who could potentially become the club’s new manager for next season. Doubts have been cast over Pochettino’s future at PSG in recent weeks, with the French Ligue 1 champions unconvinced by what they have seen since his appointment in January 2021. According to L’Equipe, via Le10sport, former Real Madrid coach, Zinedine Zidane is one of PSG’s priorities to succeed the Argentine and is on their five-man shortlist. However, it is a complicated deal to close since Zidane is waiting for the French national team’s managerial post to become vacant as Didier Deschamps may leave the dugout after the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. The report added that PSG are also keeping tabs on Tottenham Hotspur’s Antonio Conte. Another manager on the shortlist is former Germany head coach Joachim Löw.
