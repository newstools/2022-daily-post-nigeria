Unknown gunmen have killed three men and wounded three others at Gurbin Maganiya community in Jibia Local Government Area of Katsina State. Those who lost their lives were identified as Muntari Naqawuri, Surajo Salisu and Musa Hassan while Mustapha Salisu, Basiru Abubakar and Muhammed Rabiu were wounded. A reliable source, who pleaded anonymity, told DAILY POST in the state that the unidentified gunmen arrived last Saturday in the community on motorcycles at about 10pm. The hoodlums, it was learnt, would have overran the community but for the quick intervention of some security operatives. When contacted, however, the state spokesman of the Katsina State Police Command, Gambo Isah, could not pick his call for confirmation as at the time of filing this report.
