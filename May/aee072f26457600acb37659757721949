The Nigeria Union of Journalists, (NUJ), Yobe State Council has tasked working Journalists in the state to be professionals in their reportage and fact-check information before publishing or broadcasting. Rajab Mohammed, Chairman, Yobe State Council gave the charge in a statement marking this year’s World Press Freedom Day which comes with the theme: ‘Journalism under digital siege’. The Chairman said fact-checking information can reduce incidences of lawsuits against media practitioners. “The Union wishes to appeal to the government to intensify efforts in the fight against criminality to enable peaceful coexistence and movement across the country”. On the 2023 general elections, Rajab appealed to politicians to shun campaigns of calumny and insist on a smooth transition. This year’s World Press Freedom Day theme: “Journalism under digital siege” spotlights the multiple ways in which journalism is endangered by surveillance and digitally-mediated attacks on journalists, and the consequences of all this on public trust in digital communications.
