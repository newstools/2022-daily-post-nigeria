Former Arsenal midfielder, Emmanuel Petit, has named Tammy Abraham, Gabriel Jesus, Raheem Sterling, Wilfried Zaha and Allan Saint-Maximin as five players that Arsenal should sign in the summer. Petit wants the Gunners to bring in ‘at least’ four new signings to bolster Mikel Arteta’s squad. With just three games remaining, Arsenal are currently four points ahead of fifth-placed Tottenham and will secure a top-four spot if they beat their north London rivals in a rescheduled Premier League clash on Thursday. The former France international said the Gunners squad still needs strengthening this summer for them to stand any chance of competing with the big boys. Petit wants Jesus and Sterling from Manchester City, Abraham from Roma, Crystal Palace’s Zaha and Newcastle United’s Saint-Maximin at the Emirates Stadium. Petit, speaking to Genting Casino, said: “Abraham could be a very good option, especially after what happened at Chelsea. ‘I’ve heard big names as well, Gabriel Jesus, Raheem Sterling, I really like Wilfried Zaha, or even someone like Allan Saint-Maximin from Newcastle. “There are no options, they need at least four players, at least two up front.”
