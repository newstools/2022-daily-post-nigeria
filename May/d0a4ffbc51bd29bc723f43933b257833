West Ham United have stepped up their bid to sign Watford forward, Emmanuel Dennis. According to Football Insider, the Hammers have already held talks with the Nigerian international. Dennis is expected to leave Watford this summer following the Hornets relegation from the Premier League. The 24-year-old linked up with the London club from Belgian Pro League outfit Club Brugge last summer. The versatile forward scored 10 goals and recorded six assists in 33 league appearances for Watford this season. Watford are willing to sell the player, but will demand around £20m from any potential suitors. Dennis’ representatives were in London earlier this week to hold talks with interested clubs, including West Ham. West Ham United are looking to bolster their attacking options next season and see Dennis as a suitable alternative.
