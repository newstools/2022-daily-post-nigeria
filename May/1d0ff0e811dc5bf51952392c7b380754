The Council of Registered Builders of Nigeria (CORBON) on Tuesday made a revelation on the collapsed Ikoyi building. The body took a Coroner’s Inquest that none of its members was involved in the project, NAN reports. A registered builder, Ahmed Babatunde made the disclosure when being questioned by Akin George, counsel for Lagos government. Babatunde testified before the Lagos Island Coroner Division at Court 4, Surulere. During cross-examination by State Counsel, E.O. Akinde, the witness said there was no evidence that showed speed in the construction. He said the building could have collapsed as a result of “premature loading, shock and vibration”. “Also, we can see from the exhibits B, C and D that some sequence of construction was not followed during the project exhibition.” Babatunde added that the type of construction adopted was a “wet work construction“. Wet work construction, according to the expert, is a concrete work which must be given time to gain strength.
