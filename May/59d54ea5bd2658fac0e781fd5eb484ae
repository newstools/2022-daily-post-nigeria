The Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) has reacted to claim by former Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, that he was not safe in custody as there was no threat to his life. DAILY POST had reported on Thursday, approached a Federal High Court for another bail plea. Kyari and three of his co-defendants, through their counsel, urged Justice Emeka Nwite to admit them to bail because their lives in the Kuje Correctional Centre, where they are being remanded, were unsafe. Report had also emerged that Kyari was assaulted by some inmates and he escaped death. Reacting, Mr Francis Enobore, the Service Public Relations Officer (SPRO), Mr Francis Enobore, described the allegation that Kyari was attacked by his fellow inmates as fake. According to him, “the story is false, reckless and mischievous.” Enobore said the report was the handiwork of some jobless cheap recognition-seeking charlatans masquerading as newsmen, lacking in intellectual capacity to interrogate what they conjure or hear before feeding the public. “That the author is completely oblivious of where and how detention of a suspect originates speaks volume of his ineptitude and the much his story can be relied upon. “For the record, Abba Kyari is one of the over 800 inmates in the location where he is being kept. “However, notable individuals including ex-governors, ministers, senators and other celebrities of higher social status have passed through the same facility without any threat to their lives,” he said. He emphasized that Kyari was safe and sound and goes about his daily routine like any other inmate unharmed.
