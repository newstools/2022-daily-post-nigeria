The sitting Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, has allegedly picked the expression of interest and nomination forms for the 2023 presidential race. He is contesting under the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Sources who confirmed the latest development said the CBN Governor picked the N100 million forms from the party’s organising secretary at the International Conference Centre (ICC) in Abuja, on Friday morning. DAILY POST recalls that there had been speculations that Emefiele was interested in succeeding President Muhammadu Buhari, but his media managers had debunked it, claiming it was a fake report. He had in February 2014, been appointed as CBN Governor, and served under former President Goodluck Jonathan hours after he announced the suspension of his predecessor, Sanusi Lamido. In 2019, the former Managing Director of Zenith Bank made history as the first CBN governor to be reappointed. Prior to purchasing the forms, his posters were seen in major cities, including the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. Some persons believed to be his support group had also used his posters to brand some campaign vehicles, but many Nigerians were cautious about the information because he was still serving out his term as CBN governor.
