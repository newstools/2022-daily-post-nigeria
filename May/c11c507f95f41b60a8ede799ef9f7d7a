Incoming Manchester United manager, Erik ten Hag, has described Cristiano Ronaldo as ‘giant’. Ten Hag said he would work with the current Manchester United squad and make them function as a team. The Dutchman has done his work at Ajax and as he was in charge of his final game for the title winners on Sunday and is preparing to begin work with Manchester United on Monday. Ajax drew 2-2 with Vitesse on Sunday to end their title-winning Eredivisie campaign. And after the game, the 52-year-old told a post-match press conference that he will begin preparations with Manchester United ahead of next season. Meanwhile, speculation over Ronaldo’s future at United has grown in recent months. “From tomorrow, my focus will be on United, and I will of course get deep into things there,” Ten Hag said after his final game with Ajax on Sunday. “What I have to say about it is, the detailed analysis still has to begin, I still have to work with the team, but let me be clear that at United there are a lot of good players around. “We have to make them function as a team but definitely Ronaldo, he is a giant.”
