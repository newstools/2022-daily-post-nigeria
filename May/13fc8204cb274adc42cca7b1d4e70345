Personnel of the Economy and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) on Saturday stormed the venue of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) national convention holding in Abuja. The officers, who were in red jackets with the “EFCC” crested at the back, were seen in their numbers walking around and inside the venue. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) correspondents covering the convention reports that the anti-graft officers, whose purpose of presence was still unknown, declined to speak with the media. Meanwhile, PDP National Director of Publicity, Chinwe Nnorom announced that phones are barred from the voting area. She said, “If you are not a delegate don’t go close to the cubicles, delegates should also note that phones are not allowed around the voting cubicle.”
