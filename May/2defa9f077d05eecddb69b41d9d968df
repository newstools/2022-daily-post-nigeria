Sokoto State Governor and Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential aspirant, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, has called on the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, to as a matter of urgency resign his position in the interest of the nation’s economy. Tambuwal, who made the call while addressing PDP delegates in Jalingo on Saturday, viewed the economy of the country as being in shambles. The decision of Emefiele to run for the presidency, he believed, would have an immediate effect on the economy, considering its volatility. He said, “It is high time that President Muhammadu Buhari called Emefiele to order. If he wants to contest, he must resign.” Wondering why Emefiele would remain in office as CBN governor while seeking for the number one position of the country, he said, “If you want to run, please run, but leave our Central Bank alone.” Tambuwal, who noticed that the economy is very volatile and such a decision can affect the economy, decried the present state of the nation’s economy. Tambuwal, while noting that successful leadership demands fairness and equity, felt sad that the country is now more divided than ever before.
