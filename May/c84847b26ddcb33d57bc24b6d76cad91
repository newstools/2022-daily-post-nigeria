Following speculation in some quarters that Senator Mallam Ibrahim Shekarau was planning to join the New Nigeria People’s Party, NNPP, Governor Umar Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State, on Friday, stormed the home of the former governor to stop his defection. Shekarau was said to have stormed Kano alongside Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, the NNPP presidential hopeful, Friday, in what appears to be a new collaboration to take over power from the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, in 2023. However, Governor Ganduje, who is apparently aware of unforeseen consequences should Kwankwaso and Shekarau join forces, is said to be working hard to stop his predecessor from moving to the NNPP. Sule Ya’u Sule, Mallam Ibrahim Shekarau’s spokesperson, in a chat with DAILY POST, said, “Yes, Governor Ganduje was this evening at Mallam (Shekarau)’s house, but I cannot tell you what actually transpired there.” Reports had it that the moment Ganduje entered Shekarau’s house, there were thunderous echoes of the senator’s supporters shouting, “We must not be stopped from going out of the APC by whatever reason.”
