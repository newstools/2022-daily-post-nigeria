Presidential aspirant and Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal has assured that the circumstances which led to the death of Miss Deborah Moses in the state will not reoccur. He said the fate suffered by Deborah was not a true representation of Sokoto people. Recall that owing to an alleged WhatsApp message from late Deborah, against the prophet Mohammed, a mob of Islamic fundamentalists stoned her to death and set her ablaze. But Tambuwal while addressing delegates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to woo their votes in the forthcoming national convention on Saturday, said his state believed in the unity and oneness of Nigeria and that his administration has demonstrated openness and oneness of the country. “We pray it doesn’t happen again”, he said while blaming the incident on the failure of the security system. He challenged Nigerians to aspire to have a modern President who can do the job and not the President of 1984, stressing that the difference between the PDP government and the All Progressives Congress (APC) is visible for all to see.
