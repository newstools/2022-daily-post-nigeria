Former Chief of Staff to Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State Terwase Orbunde has formerly decamped from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP to the All Progressives Congress, APC. DAILY POST reports that Orbunde who recently engaged in a face-off with the state governor over an amount of money he claimed to have spent during the governor’s campaign in the 2015 election, is one of those vying for the top political office in the state. The governorship aspirant registered as a member of the APC on Monday at Ajio, headquarters of Mbaketsa council ward in Shangev-ya, Kwande local government area, of the state. APC ward chairman, Godwin Ager, after proper documentation, presented a membership card and a broom to him. He expressed appreciation to his political associates, supporters and partners for their prayers, patience, support, as well as goodwill, and appealed that all these be sustained as the elections draw near. Prior to his registration, Orbunde submitted a letter of resignation from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to the ward chairman of the party, Tersoo Ukaa.
