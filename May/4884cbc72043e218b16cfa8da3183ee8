President Muhammadu Buhari’s Personal Assistant on New Media, Bashir Ahmad, has claimed that former president, Goodluck Jonathan, has decamped from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Ahmad stated this in a tweet from his verified handle on Monday night. He wrote: “So Goodluck Jonathan has dumped the opposition PDP and now member of our great party, the All Progressives Congress (APC).” [sic]. DAILY POST reported earlier in the day that Jonathan got APC’s N100million presidential nomination form. The form was purchased for him by the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders’ Association. Jonathan himself has not confirmed if he will run in next year’s election or not.
