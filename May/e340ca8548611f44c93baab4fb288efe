A statement by the State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Sunday Abutu explained that the Command received a distress call that a group of cattle rustlers came to Ikole-Ekiti forest, attacked some herdsmen with dangerous weapons and forcefully went away with a cow valued at five hundred thousand naira (N500,000:00).
