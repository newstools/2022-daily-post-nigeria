Former Scotland midfielder, Michael Stewart, has warned Rangers not to sell their Super Eagles defender, Calvin Bassey, this summer. Stewart believes Bassey is an unbelievable player, adding that the Rangers must do everything to hold him beyond this summer. He said this after Rangers lost against Eintracht Frankfurt in the UEFA Europa League final on Wednesday night. Recall that Bassey was one of the star performers of3-+ the night as Rangers and Frankfurt met in Europe’s second-tier decider at Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan Stadium in Sevilla. Following a 1-1 draw in regulation and extra time, the Bundesliga side went on to beat Rangers 5-4 in a penalty shootout to be crowned. “Calvin Bassey is absolutely unbelievable. Can’t quite believe how good he has been in the second half of the season. “They must do everything to keep a hold of him. If players must be sold, then they can’t let him be one of them. Tremendous player,” Stewart wrote on his Twitter account. Bassey joined Rangers in 2020 as a left-back but has since been shifted to the central position owing to his commanding presence. The 22-year-old has featured for the Gers 29 times in the league this season and provided three assists.
