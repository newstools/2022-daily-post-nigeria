The Lekki Phase One Residents Association (LERA) has urged the Lagos State Government to immediately stop commercial motorcycle operations. They advised the authorities not to wait until June 1 to enforce the ban on Okada, NAN reports. The government has banned riders in six Local Government Areas: Ikeja, Surulere, Eti-Osa, Lagos Mainland, Lagos Island, and Apapa. At a news conference held on Thursday, some Lekki Phase 1 residents expressed their grievances. They displayed placards with inscriptions such as ‘Lekki Phase 1 Says no to Okada’; Let’s take back Lekki Phase 1′. LERA Chairman, Yomi Idowu stressed the need for immediate enforcement of the ban. “The government had called for the ban on commercial motorcyclists two years ago. “But to our chagrin, this was not properly enforced and soon the menace returned. “We are calling for this ban to commence with immediate effect. We choose to live and say no to okadas on our roads and streets’’, he said.
