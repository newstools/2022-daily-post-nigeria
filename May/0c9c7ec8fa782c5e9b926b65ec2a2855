Former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki has said that Nigeria has moved from being a weak nation to a failing nation under the present administration led by President Muhammadu Buhari. Saraki, a former governor of Kwara State, made this disclosure while speaking in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital on Tuesday. Saraki, who is one of the presidential aspirants on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ahead of the 2023 elections, claims Nigeria was already a weak nation before Buhari came to power in 2015. He insisted that the country has moved from being a weak nation to a failing state because the present administration has failed the citizens. Saraki while addressing the PDP delegates in Oyo State at the party’s secretariat, added that the country needs someone who will rescue it from total collapse. Present at the party’s secretariat to receive the former governor were the party chairman, Dayo Ogungbenro, secretary, Wasiu Adeleke, former Minister, Wole Oyelese, Saka Balogun and other party chieftains. Saraki while addressing the PDP members, maintained that the country needs a person who can unite the country and its people. He advised Nigerians to elect someone who has the capacity to be president in 2023. He said, “Before Buhari, APC came to power, we were a weak nation, but now, we are now a failing nation. There is a difference between a weak nation, a failing nation and a failed nation. “We have moved from a weak to a failing nation. But, we need someone who can rescue us from being a failed nation. “We must elect someone who has the capacity. We need a man with experience. We need someone who can unite Nigeria and I am that person. “We need someone who can unite both the old and the young together. Let us vote for the person that can unite the country.
