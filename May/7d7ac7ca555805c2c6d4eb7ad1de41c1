Tottenham Hotspur manager, Antonio Conte, has admitted there has been a virus outbreak in the squad this week. However, the Italian insists striker Harry Kane will be fit to play against Norwich City in their final Premier League fixture on Sunday. A win at Carrow Road would guarantee Spurs Champions League football for next season. But Kane’s fitness was thrown into doubt after he pulled out of a media appearance on Friday as a precaution due to feeling unwell. When asked if Kane will be fit for the match, Conte said: “Yes for sure. In the last game, we had Deki Kulusevski and he didn’t train on Saturday but was good to play. “Harry doesn’t want to miss this type of game.” On the rumours of illness within the Spurs camp, Conte added: “If you remember the last game, we had three or four cases of stomach problems. “In this week I have to be honest we had a couple of cases but we overcame the situation. “At this moment, though, this virus is the last of our problems. We are close to a big achievement and we are totally focused.”
