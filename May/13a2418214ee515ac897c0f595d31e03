The General Overseer of Champions Royal Assembly, Prophet Joshua Iginla has urged the Federal Government to grant Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, a presidential pardon. Iginla said if corrupt politicians can be granted a presidential pardon, then the same gesture should be extended to Kanu. He advised the Nigerian Government to grant Kanu a pardon and use him to unite the country. The clergyman spoke while addressing his members in Abuja. According to Iginla: “Recently, I read in the news that the Government of the day granted some prisoners a presidential pardon, that’s a welcome idea, but sometimes I ask myself if those ideas are factors in the unity of this country. “While you are giving people a presidential pardon, why can’t you give people like Nnamdi Kanu? A pardon that can unite the country; if the Igbos are aggrieved, we have to do things that can make this country united. An average Igbo man will tell you that he doesn’t think he’s part of this country; we are more disunited in this country. “I’m not an Igbo man, but if people stealing money in the country can be given a presidential pardon, if people killing others are called repentant Boko Haram, why will someone crying for the independence of a region not be given a pardon and called for dialogue?”
