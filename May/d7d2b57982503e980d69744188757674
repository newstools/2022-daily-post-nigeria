Three staff of Dangote cement company have been killed in a ghastly motor accident in Kogi State. The incident occurred on Thursday at about 5:45pm around Zariagi Obajana road in Kogi State. The deceased victims according to a source from the company are Victoria, Beatrice, and Aliyu. DAILY POST further learnt that it was a multiple crash that involved four vehicles: a truck, a luxurious bus, Toyota and Peugeot 406. It was also revealed by eyewitnesses that many were injured in the accident and are currently receiving treatment at an undisclosed hospital. The Kogi State Sector Commander, Federal Road Safety Corps, (FRSC) Stephen Dawulung confirmed the incident to DAILY POST on Friday Dawulung said the total number of people involved in the accident were 48 males and 15 females. He explained that ” the incident led to the death of one male adult and two female adults. While attributing the cause of the accident to overspeeding and brake failure, the Sector Commander admonished motorists to avoid overspeeding and be disciplined while plying the road. ” We will keep talking to them. Motorists know what to do but they won’t do it. Many people have lost their lives on that Obajana road due to overspeeding just because the road is a little bit good. Sometimes we say roads are not good, that is why people get into accidents. But in this case, the good roads are the ones that cause accidents because drivers don’t adhere to the speed limit. We need to adhere to the speed limit because driving has to do with discipline. If not for overspeeding even if a crash happens, the consequence will be light but when it is on top speed, the accident will be fatal” he added.
