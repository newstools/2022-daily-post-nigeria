Manchester United forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, has said that the hunger for achievements never fades. Ronaldo said this while reacting to winning the Premier League’s Player of the Month for April ahead of Manchester City’s Kevin De Bruyne. DAILY POST had on Thursday reported that the Portugal captain won the prize ahead of De Bruyne, Nathan Collins, Bruno Guimarães, Gabriel Jesus, Son Heung-min, Thiago and Leandro Trossard. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner scored five times in just four matches for the Red Devils. Ronaldo had won the same prize last September ahead of Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah. “My 2nd Premier League Player Of The Month Award, the 6th in my career. I’m as happy to win today as I was in my early days, the hunger for victory and achievements never fades away. Thanks to everyone that made this possible,” Ronaldo tweeted. In the month of April, Ronaldo scored his 100th Premier League goal in a 3-1 defeat at Arsenal, while he also registered his 50th club hat-trick in a 3-2 win over Norwich City. Ronaldo netted his fifth goal of the month, equalising to earn a 1-1 draw with Chelsea.
