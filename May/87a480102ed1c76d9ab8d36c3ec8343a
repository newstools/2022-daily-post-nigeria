Senator Emmanuel Bwacha, representing Taraba South Senatorial District, on Wednesday, reacted to the Court of Appeal judgment on the Electoral Act, saying it’s a good development for the nation’s democracy. The Court of Appeal Abuja Division, on Wednesday, set aside the judgment of the Federal High Court in Umuahia which voided the provision of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022 and upheld that the provision was in line with fairness to all citizens. Senator Bwacha, who is also a governorship aspirant in the 2023 general election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Taraba, believed that the court decision would strengthen democratic governance. According to him, political appointees should resign before going into a contest in the spirit of fairness, justice and equity. According to him, “There is nothing wrong with the court judgment, in fact it is in order. I could recall when I was a Commissioner in Taraba State some years back, I had to resign my appointment to contest for elective office. “It has always been like that and I don’t know if the current appointees should be different,” he said.” President Muhammadu Buhari had on Wednesday ordered the resignation of his cabinet members who are contesting elections into various political offices in 2023. Also, three members of President Muhammadu Buhari have already tendered their resignation to enable them participate in their party’s primaries. They are the Minister of State for Education, Chuckwuemeka Nwajuba, the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, Ogbonaya Onu, and Godswill Akpabio, Niger Delta Minister, with more to follow suit. The Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, who is contesting for Kebbi governorship and the Central Bank governor, Mr Godwin Emefiele who is a presidential aspirant were yet to resign as at Wednesday, but have until Monday to do so.
