Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has reacted to their 3-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on Thursday. According to Arteta, he will be “suspended for six months” if he gives his opinion on some of the decisions that went against his team. The Gunners conceded a controversial penalty, before Rob Holding was sent off after picking up two yellow cards in the first half. Harry Kane converted from the spot kick and scored one more as Spurs took the lead, before Heung-Min Son added one more after the break. When Arteta was asked about the referee decisions, he said: “If I say what I think I’m suspended six months. “I’m allowed to give my interpretation of what happened but I don’t know how to lie.”
