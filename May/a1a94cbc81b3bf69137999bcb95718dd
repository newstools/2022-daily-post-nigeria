Former Senator, Francis Arthur Nzeribe has passed on. Nzeribe died at the age of 83 on Sunday morning. The former lawmaker died of an undisclosed ailment at a foreign hospital. “He died this morning in a hospital abroad. The family will soon release a statement,” a family source told Sahara Reporters. Nzeribe was elected a Senator to represent Orlu in 1999. In November 2002, a former Senate President, Anyim Pius Anyim, suspended Nzeribe indefinitely over an allegation of N22 million fraud.
