Apostle Johnson Suleman of the Omega Fire Ministries, Auchi, Edo State, has hit out at Arsenal after the club’s failure to qualify for next season’s Champions League. Suleman said Arsenal are not ready for the Champions League, adding that the Gunners disappoint when it matters most. The clergyman said this while reacting to Arsenal’s Premier League final day 5-1 victory over Everton on Sunday evening at Emirates Stadium. Goals from Gabriel Martinelli, Eddie Nketiah, Cedric Soares, Gabriel Magalhaes and Martin Odegaard gave Arsenal the victory over Frank Lampard’s men. The result against Everton means Mikel Arteta’s men finished in the fifth position on the Premier League table this season. Reacting, Suleman, a passionate Arsenal fan, in a tweet via his Twitter handle after the game, wrote: “Arsenal will just disappoint you when it matters most. Sadly! “Not so bad for the season, though! Obviously, we aren’t ready for UCL. Let’s hope we buy quality come summer!”
