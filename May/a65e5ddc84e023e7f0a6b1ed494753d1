A popular rights activist, Deji Adeyanju, has accused Vice President Yemi Osinbajo of desperation in his 2023 presidential campaign. Adeyanju accused Osinbajo of behaving like a desperate yahoo boy. The Abuja-based lawyer reacted to Osinbajo’s recent promise to end the ‘up NEPA’ chorus and give Nigerians broadband internet if elected President in 2023. In a post on his Facebook, Adeyanju wondered why Osinbajo has refused to use his superpower in resolving Nigeria’s power issues since the current government assumed power seven years ago. According to Adeyanju: “Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo is behaving like a desperate Yahoo Boy. “So you could solve Nigeria’s power problem in the last seven years and you kept this superpower away from your own Govt?”
