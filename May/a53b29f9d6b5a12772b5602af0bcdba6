Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, a presidential aspirant under the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has withdrawn from the race. The businessman announced his withdrawal on Friday via a statement from his media office, saying his own day will come. He added that certain developments made him withdraw, citing them as the reason he did not purchase the N100 million APC nomination form. He added that he is “retreating not out of the lack of will to fight for our resolve and collective aspiration for a New Nigeria, a struggle which has attracted enormous support. Sometimes will and resolve, energy and preparation may not be enough to engage in an encounter.” “I stepped aside believing that another day will come. I hope our party will still be able to find a candidate for the 2023 election that will unite and secure our country. One that will lead an inclusive government, and build a prosperous economy that will not leave anyone behind. I leave the race believing that by the Grace of God my own day will come!” He said. Olawepo-Hashim had declared his intention to contest on May 3, 2022. He had consulted APC stakeholders in the North Central before throwing his hat in the ring.
