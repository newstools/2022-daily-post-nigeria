Former Governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi has joined the Labour Party. Obi confirmed this on his Twitter page on Friday as he registered with the party in his Agulu Ward in Anambra State. Giving reasons for joining the Labour Party, Obi said:“ Since I resigned from the PDP because of issues that are at variance with my persona and principles, I have consulted widely with various parties and personalities to ensure we do not complicate the route to our desired destination. “ For me, the process of achieving our goal is as fundamental as what one will do thereafter. “Therefore, I have chosen a route that I consider to be in line with our aspirations and my mantra of taking the country from consumption to production; and that is the Labour Party which is synonymous with the people, workers, development, production, securing and uniting Nigerians as one family. “I invite all Nigerians to join me in taking back our country. “Be assured that I’ll never let you down.”
