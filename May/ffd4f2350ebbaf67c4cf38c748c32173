A coalition of pro-Biafra groups has thrown its weight behind the quest for Nigerian President of Igbo extraction. The coalition, made up of pro-Biafra groups from the old Eastern region, said they had resolved to support the clamour for the Nigeria presidency of Igbo extraction, whether from the South-East or the South-South. In a statement signed by Comrade Udemba Okwudili, the administrative Secretary of the group, they said the people of the region must unite against those “who used divide and rule syndrome against our fathers and are still relevant in their scheme of political subjugation.” He said they had watched the political enslavement by the northern oligarchy against the southern elements, “which if unchecked, will continue to jeopardize the political and economical emancipation of the people of Eastern region from Nigeria.” He added that, “we have unanimously resolved that we shall support any Igbo aspirant that emerges as a candidate for the office of Mr. President, whether from the South-East or the Igbo South-South States, including Rivers. DAILY POST reports that apart from other presidential aspirants from the South-East, Governor Nyesom Wike and Rotimi Amaechi are both from Igbo speaking areas of Rivers State.
