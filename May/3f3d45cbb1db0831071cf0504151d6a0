Joe Igbokwe, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Lagos State, has cautioned the North against thinking it would produce President Muhammadu Buhari’s successor in 2023. Igbokwe said the North should perish the thought of a Northerner succeeding Buhari in 2023. The Special Adviser to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State on Drainage and Water Resources said the clamour for a Northerner to succeed Buhari in 2023 is “a joke”. In a Facebook post, Igbokwe wrote: “Someone just called me to say that the North is thinking about producing the presidency again in 2023. I laughed until tears started coming out of my eyes. Perish the thought and consider it a joke.” Ahead of APC’s Presidential primary election, the party is yet to zone its ticket. President Buhari is from the North, while the party’s National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, is also from the North. But there is now a counter-clamour to throw the ticket open to all the six geo-political zones of Nigeria, which seems to be gaining the upper hand.
