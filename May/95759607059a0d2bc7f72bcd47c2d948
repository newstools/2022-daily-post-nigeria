A chieftain of the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bauchi State, Ukkasha Hamza Rahama, on Wednesday, frowned at the alleged destruction of aspirants’ billboards in the state. Rahama called on the state Commissioner of Police and the Director of the State Security Services (DSS) to arrest and prosecute those destroying billboards of APC aspirants, so as to serve as a deterrent to others. The APC chief made the call while speaking with journalists in Bauchi, drawing a particular reference to the recent destruction of campaign billboards of an APC gubernatorial aspirant, Nura Manu Soro by some unknown persons, describing the development as “condemnable and unfortunate”. According to Rahama, the destruction of the aspirant’s campaign billboards was coming at the time that the said Nura Manu Soro had “every constitutional right to contest whatever political seat he may deem fit, according to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria”. He said, “I see the need to draw the attention of His Excellency the Executive Governor of Bauchi State Senator Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed (Kauran Bauchi) on the urgent need to address the increasing attacks on the opposition All Progressives Congress in the state, especially as we are approaching the general elections of which the process of electing leaders through party process has commenced earnestly,. “The governor, as a beneficiary of opposition, must protect Bauchi’s long ancestral heritage where power and money do not win elections for aspirants.” He added that the clampdown on the opposition APC in the state was condemnable, saying that, “it should not continue to happen as the recurrence of such will pitch the parties and the politicians against each other and consequently deny the state any meaningful development. “We are using this medium to call on the Commissioner of Police and the Director of the State Security Services in the state and security agencies to ensure that these political thugs and their sponsors behind this ugly and unfortunate situation are arrested and prosecuted according to the laws of the land to serve as a deterrent to others who may have similar motives.”
