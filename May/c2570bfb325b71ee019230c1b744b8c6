The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has expressed its displeasure with the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor, Karim Khan. Khan, who was in Nigeria a fortnight ago, held talks with President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo at the State House in Abuja. In a statement on Friday, CAN General Secretary, Joseph Daramola said the body wrote to Khan twice in 2021 to engage him on religious violence affecting Christians. “Till this day, we have not heard any response. Mr. Khan failed to make any contact with us before, during or after his visit to Abuja. “To our consternation, we found out about his visit in the media. It appears that this Prosecutor engages in political games and is unwilling to engage with victims of atrocity.” The Christian leadership maintained there is a great deal of explaining to be done because Khan only met with Nigerian officials. CAN accused Khan of playing a political game, prioritizing relations with the government and not interested in standing up for those being attacked. The statement noted that for many years, the Christian community has borne the brunt of the religious violence in Africa’s biggest nation. “We have, in a communication that was ignored by the Prosecutor, pointed out flaws in the approach taken by his predecessor in relation to Nigeria.” CAN vowed to vigorously challenge the murder and targeting of Christians even if the ICC does not take a decisive action as expected. Noting that the search for justice and redress for “persecuted and brutalized Christians” will not stop, the body said it remained willing to engage Khan and his office.
