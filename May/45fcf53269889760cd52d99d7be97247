The Aragbiji of Iragbiji, Oba Abdur-Rasheed Ayotunde Olabomi Odundun IV, has described the killing of Deborah Samuel as an unIslamic act. Oba Olabomi, who condemned the killing of Miss Samuel, also described the protests and mayhem that was unleashed on Sokoto town and the destruction suffered by businesses and innocent residents, as worrisome and uncalled for. The monarch made this known via a statement signed by Abdulkareem Opeyemi Mubarak, his Press Officer. The monarch, while urging everyone to exercise restraint, remain calm and ensure peaceful coexistence between people of different faiths, charges law enforcement agencies to get to the root of the problem and arrest the culprits responsible for her death. In his words, “Even as many Nigerians, including Islamic scholars and groups condemn the dastardly act of jungle justice, it is unfortunate that some mindless bigots have the temerity to defend the criminal act. “I call on law enforcement agencies to fish out other collaborators and bring all of them to justice. I also appeal to the Nigerian youths to shun all acts of criminality under the guise of religion. All the perpetrators of Deborah’s murder must be made to face the law of the land. “Killing of fellow human being unlawfully has no place in Islam. This issue must be treated as a very heinous criminal act and the law of the land must take its cause.” Deborah Samuel, a student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, was accused of blasphemy and burnt to death by a mob of extremists on Thursday, May 12, 2022. On Saturday, May 21, 2022, a mob also embarked on a violent protest in order to forcefully secure the release of two of the alleged perpetrators of the heinous crime who are under police custody.
