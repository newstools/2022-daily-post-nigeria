Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, the Governor of Ondo State, has congratulated Muslim faithful in the state and around the country on the successful completion of Ramadan and the celebration of this year’s Eid-el-Fitr. Akeredolu urged the faithful to uphold the principles of Ramadan, which had ended today in their daily activities. In a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Richard Olatunde, the Governor urged all Muslims to ponder on the lessons of Ramadan by praying and giving supplication for the nation’s peace and growth. “The Holy month of Ramadan teaches kindness, forgiveness and sacrifice. We must uphold these teachings and imbibe it as we live together in peace and harmony. “We must continue to seek God’s face more than ever before. At this crucial time in our nation, we must join voices and seek God’s intervention on the issues of insecurity. “As we also prepare to elect a new leader for the country in the forthcoming 2023 elections, we must pray for God’s choice.” Akeredolu reiterated his administration’s commitment to promoting understanding and peaceful coexistence among the people of the state, irrespective of their religious differences.
