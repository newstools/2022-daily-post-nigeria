The Zamfara State commissioner of Religious Affairs and Chief Imam of Muslims Foundation Jumu’at Mosque in Gusau, the State capital, Dr. Muhammad Tukur Sani Jangebe, has urged the Federal Government to as a matter of fact address the demands of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). Sheikh Jangebe stated this in Gusau while answering questions from newsmen. According to him, the strike was seriously affecting the entire teaching and learning system among students and their lecturers across the country. “The Federal Government should look into negotiating with ASUU and bringing back our children to their respective universities for them to continue with their studies. “Everyone knows that the contribution teachers are giving to nation building can never be overemphasised and we are calling on the government to provide a mechanism to boost their morale,” he said. He also called on parents and teachers of various institutions of learning to intensify prayers. The Chief Imam also called on the Federal Government to look into the ultimatum given by the colleges of education union in order to salvage the education system of the country from total collapse.
