Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has rated Chelsea’s chances of finishing top four in the Premier League table after their latest 1-0 loss to Everton on Sunday. Tuchel also explained why he benched Lukaku against Everton at Goodison Park. Frank Lampard’s side defeated Chelsea, thanks to Richarlison’s only goal of the match. Speaking on Chelsea’s chance of finishing top four, Tuchel said during his post-match press conference: “I said it weeks ago. I never feel safe. And it doesn’t matter if we are in a race for top four, the last four games are not enough. Four points is never enough no matter the race we are in.” On why he did not bring on Lukaku against Everton, the German added: “Because we brought Jorginho off. We only had three changes.”
