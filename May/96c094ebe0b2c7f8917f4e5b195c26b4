The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has appealed for calm in Sokoto over the demonstration that followed Deborah Samuel’s killing. The Islamic group told the demonstrators to respect the Sultan of Sokoto, Sa’ad Abubakar, the leader of Muslims in Nigeria. Deborah, a 200 level student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education, was lynched on Thursday. On Saturday, protesters stormed the streets to demand the release of the suspects linked to her murder. The Police had announced that two persons are in custody. It is unclear if more arrests have been made. In a statement, MURIC director, Prof Ishaq Akintola noted that now is not the time for division but for peace. “As the seat of the caliphate, we must always ensure that Sokoto State is peaceful. “The state must be allowed to develop both spiritually and economically.” Akintola said Muslim faithful across Nigeria “has tons of love and immeasurable respect” for the Sultan. “We demand same from the Muslim youths in Sokoto State”, the statement added.
