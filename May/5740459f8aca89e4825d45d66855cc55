The Trade Union Council (TUC) has decried increasing spate of insecurity nationwide. Chairman of TUC Kaduna State, Comrade Abdullahi A Danfulani, on Sunday, in Kaduna, described insecurity and hunger as major challenges confronting Nigerian workers. In a press conference to herald the Workers’ Day celebration, Alhaji Danfulani, however, urged workers and Nigerians to continue to pray for peace, unity and love as the challenges facing the country would soon be a thing of the past. He lamented that banditry, kidnapping, cattle rustling and other criminal activities were giving Nigerians sleepless nights, just as he tasked governments at all levels to find lasting solution to the mirage. He added that following the outbreak of COVID-19, the congress had always marked the Workers’ Day on a low key, with the 2022 edition marked same way. He recalled that Workers’ Day was first marked in 1980 in Kano State, when the Executive Governor, was late Alhaji Abubakar Rimi and since then, it has been marked annually on May 1, which informed the press briefing. According to him, other activities organised by TUC to mark the day, include Juma’at Mosque prayers on Friday April 29 and church prayers on May 1. On steps taken to cushion the economic realities on its members, he said that they sought funds from the Federal Mortgage Bank of NIgeria (FMBN) to help in securing housing to the tune of N2bn. He also listed other interventions to include the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Anchor Borrower Programme by its members. “We are getting soft loans from workers to start small business around houses that won’t affect their work,” he added.
