Abducted Kaduna-Abuja train passengers are still in captivity ten weeks after their abduction. Bandits had on March 27, 2022, kidnapped over 300 Kaduna-Abuja train passengers after killing eight, and wounding 26 others. Nine days later, the bandits released one of the victims, the Managing-Director of the Nigerian Bank of Agriculture, Mr. Alwan Hassan, on age grounds. The bandits, who refused to accept monetary ransom, had threatened to kill all the abducted passengers if the federal government refused to free their members in government custody. On April 27, 2022, one of the victims, a pregnant woman, reportedly gave birth through the help of a doctor provided by the bandits. Although the abducted train passengers are still in captivity, the federal government, through the Managing Director of Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC), Fidet Okhiria, on May 06, 2022, told Nigerians that Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) has completed the repairs of the Abuja-Kaduna rail track bombed by the bandits. He further told the world that the Abuja-Kaduna train service would resume soon with additional security measures put in place. Angered by this, friends, relations and parents of abducted victims vehemently warned the federal government not to allow the train resume operations while victims of train attack were still in captivity.
