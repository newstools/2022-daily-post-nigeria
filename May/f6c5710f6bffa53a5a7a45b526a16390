In spite of the Kaduna State University (KASU) management order compelling students to resume on May 9, 2022, the school still remained under lock and key. Management of the institution on April 27, 2022, ordered students to resume academic activities on May 9, 2022. However, ASUU-KASU branch, while reacting to the directive given to students by the school management, appealed to students/parents to ignore the order, pending the outcome of the meeting between the National body of the union, and Federal Government. DAILY POST on a visit to KASU on May 9, 2022, and May 10, 2022, observed that all entrance/school gates were locked and keyed except the central administrative block where a fierce looking security guard mounted the gate, with rapt attention, throwing question to anyone entry the school premises. As at the time of visit, few administrative staff were seen standing discussing the next step to take. When DAILY POST approached one of the school management staff on the next step, he declined comments, and referred the reporter to the higher authority. Also, when asked by the ASUU-KASU chairman, he declined comments, instead sent a press release dated April 27, 2022, saying, all you want to know about ASUU-KASU is contained in the press release. However, the content of the press release was not different from the widely reported reactions of the union over KASU management’s threat to resume on May 9, 2022.
