The Ebonyi State Police Command has found a 26-year-old lady, Miss Ugochukwu Nworie dead in a hotel. The Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Loveth Odah, on behalf of the Commissioner of Police, Aliyu Garba, on Wednesday in Abakaliki, vowed to arrest killers of the victim. She disclosed that investigation confirmed that the Lady was gang-raped, as more than 12 used condoms were found in the hotel room. She stated that an investigation was still ongoing and other information needed will be provided at a later time. The police Spokesperson said the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) of Kpirikpiri Police Division in the State, confirmed that the incident took place in Hope-in hotel, situated at Nine Ngbowo Street, Abakaliki. “The DPO reported that the incident took place while on a routine check on the hotel. A room not accounted for was discovered. “So the DPO decided to enquire from the receptionist, who told him that the guests in the room were unknown to him. “Efforts to open the room proved abortive, until he requested for the spare key to open the door, only to discover a lifeless body of the lady, naked and her legs, hands with mouth were tied to the bed in the room,” Odah said. She added the corpse had been deposited at a morgue, describing the incident as unfortunate and an offence against humanity. Odah advised the general public, especially young ladies, to be careful, adding that efforts were on top gear to arrest and prosecute those behind her death.
