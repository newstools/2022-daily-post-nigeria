Arsenal held on to beat 10-man Leeds United 2-1 at the Emirates on Sunday. The Gunners were playing a day after their rivals Tottenham Hotspur were held to a 1-1 draw at Liverpool. The result meant Mikel Arteta’s men could go four points clear of their North London rivals ahead of Thursday’s derby. Eddie Nketiah’s brace saw Arsenal race into a two-goal lead within the opening 10 minutes. Although Luke Ayling was shown a red card, the hosts failed to extend their lead and there was a nervy ending after Leeds pulled one back through Diego Llorente. If Arsenal win at Tottenham next week, they will officially clinch fourth place.
