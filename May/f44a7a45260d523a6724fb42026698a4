Ben Igbakpa, the House of Representatives member for Ethiope Federal Constituency has spoken on his defeat. The incumbent lost the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to Erhiatake Ibori-Suenu. Erhiatake is the daughter of James Ibori, a former Governor and Delta politics honcho. On Mondays, Igbakpa and Erhiatake tied at 34 votes each at the primary election held at the Oghara Township stadium. At the re-run on Tuesday, Igbakpa polled 22 votes while Erhiatake got 46. In a statement, the lawmaker declared that the outcome was the result of muscling. He said the majority of the people recognize competence, invested their hopes and expected quality representation. “The public opinion is that we delivered and realized the dreams of most people. All of these have been painfully stolen by the establishment. “The grave silence on the streets amplifies the fatal setback for Ethiope Federal Constituency. My contest was never about me but for the people. “Hence their grief. Neither I nor the people prevailed in our hope for sustenance. We have now seen what force and intimidation can do.” Igbakpa said he would continue to devote to the development of Ethiope and continue to advance my belief in democratic good governance. “I wish the winners of today’s re-run all the best and I pray that the losers (the people) can endure the outcome and the aftermath”, he added.
