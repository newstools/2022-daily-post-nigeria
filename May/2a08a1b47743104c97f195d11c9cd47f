Reno Omokri, a socio-political activist, has reacted as Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders’ Association purchased the All Progressives Congress, APC presidential nomination form for Goodluck Jonathan. DAILY POST had reported that Jonathan on Monday got APC’s N100million presidential nomination form. Although Jonathan has not confirmed if he will run in next year’s election, reactions have trailed his defection from the People Democratic Party, PDP to APC. Reacting, Omokri on his Twitter page urged Nigerians to read between the lines. He maintained that he will continue to follow Goodluck Jonathan “To those who think I am in a dilemma, just be patient. You will all be so disappointed with yourselves and your premature celebration when you see my next tweet. “I am, after all, the #TableShaker! You guys are so easy to manipulate. They just yank your chain and you drink kunu. “First of all, to whet your appetite, let me say that under the rain and under the sun, I will follow Jonathan. Secondly, I can’t ever be one with APC. Thirdly, nobody can shave HE @GEJonathan’s head in his absence. Read between the lines.”
