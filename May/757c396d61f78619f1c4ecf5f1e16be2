A group has alleged of plans to manipulate the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) primary election in Ibadan North Federal constituency. The group, Southwest Watchers, made this disclosure via a statement made available to DAILY POST, Sunday evening. Ibadan North is one of the federal constituencies in Oyo South Senatorial district. Southwest Watchers alleged that some politicians were making attempts to manipulate the primary election in the federal constituency, earlier scheduled to hold on Sunday but was postponed. Secretary of the group, Engineer Wale Adeoti in a statement made available to DAILY POST in Ibadan, insisted that the party’s primary election must be free and fair. The group noted with dismay that the politicians, in an attempt to manipulate the primary, did all the necessary things to postpone the primary election. Adeoti alleged that the politicians deliberately omitted name of one of the candidates which resulted into the postponement of the party’s primaries on Sunday. He added that the ruling party ought to find a solution to the plans by the few politicians in an attempt to manipulate the election. He said, “They deliberately omitted one of their favorite candidate’s name for them to restrategize and find other ways to manipulate the election. “We already know that some politicians are making every attempt to swerve the true course of democracy, in the ongoing primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party in Oyo State. “They are already perfecting arrangements to compromise the voting process; and the delegates, including INEC officials, to ensure victory for their candidate in the primary election.”
