Former Manchester United keeper, Tomasz Kuszczak, has urged Bayern Munich’s Robert Lewandowski to join the Red Devils. Kuszczak believes Lewandowski would be a perfect partner for Cristiano Ronaldo and has spoken to him about this. Lewandowski is keen to leave Bayern Munich this summer as he wants a fresh challenge. “It would be fantastic to see him [Lewandowski] at Manchester United. I have had conversations with him about it and when he was back at Borussia Dortmund,” Kuszczak told Metro (via Bet365). “He had options during his previous move as his contract was expiring. I know for a fact that he was thinking about leaving Germany and going somewhere else. I know he loves Spanish football and has a connection with Real Madrid,” he said. He added, “You hear people say, ‘Bayern Munich is full of great players, it is easy’, but he’s played well everywhere he’s gone. “I would love to see him at Manchester United, but we have spoken about that, and it would be fantastic if he could come and link up with Ronaldo. He and Ronaldo upfront would be something.”
