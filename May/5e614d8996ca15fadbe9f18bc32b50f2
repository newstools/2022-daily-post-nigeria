Gareth Bale has revealed why he missed Real Madrid’s La Liga title celebrations on Saturday. The Welsh man said he could not participate in the celebrations because of a ‘back spasm’. The former Tottenham winger was the only member of the first-team squad that was not present as the Galacticos paraded their 35th league title across the Spanish capital. The Wales international has not played any significant part for Madrid this term with supporters making their feelings towards him known, each time, booing him. The 32-year-old’s made just seven appearances across all competitions and he’s set to leave the Bernabeu at the end of the season when his contract expires. There were speculations among supporters of the club that his absence from the title celebrations was down to a disinterest in the club, with Bale often accused of not caring about football. But the winger has dismissed those claims, insisting that he was gutted to miss the celebrations because of a back problem. ‘So disappointed that I’m not able to be part of the celebrations this evening due to a bad back spasm but really proud of the team for winning the title,’ said Bale on Twitter. ‘Enjoy tonight boys!’
