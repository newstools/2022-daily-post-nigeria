Wife of the immediate past Governor of Anambra State, Willie Obiano, Mrs Ebelechukwu has won the ticket of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) to contest for a seat in the Senate. Mrs Obiano is running to represent the people of Anambra North Senatorial zone in the National Assembly. Mrs Obiano, in the keenly contested primary election, which held at Chuba Ikpeazu Township Stadium in Onitsha on Sunday, beat Mr Primus Odili, who was her husband’s Chief of Staff, during his tenure as governor. Results released by the election committee showed that Mrs Obiano, who is popularly known as Osodieme, scored 152 votes, while Odili scored 120 votes. Two other aspirants, Mr Junior Onwuteaka and Mr Tony Nnacheta scored two votes each. Violence had erupted at Otuocha Stadium in Anambra East Local Government Area on Saturday at the venue of the election, forcing the committee to move it to Sunday. Mrs Obiano has been having a tough challenge over her aspiration, as two persons, said to have been made by her husband, had allegedly ganged up to stop her from picking the ticket. Wife of the former governor will now square up with Princess Stella Oduah, a former Minister of Aviation and current senator of the zone in the general election next year.
