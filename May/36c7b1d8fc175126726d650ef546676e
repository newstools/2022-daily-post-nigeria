The Ekiti State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has stated that an allegation by a former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, that the Governor of Ekiti State and presidential aspirant of the party, Dr Kayode Fayemi, once asked him to rig an election in his favour has confirmed that Fayemi is an election rigger and never a democrat. The Ekiti State Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Raphael Adeyanju, in a statement in Ado Ekiti on Wednesday, said, “Comrade Oshiomhole’s allegation, which was made on national television that Fayemi is a fraudulent democrat has only reinforced our stance that the incumbent Governor of Ekiti State has never won any free and fair election. He has always been a product of rigged election and manipulated judicial victory.” Adeyanju dismissed the desperate attempt of the governor’s spokesman to launder the image of his principal “when the damage has been puerile and laughable. Since members of the public are fully aware of what is going on in the APC.” “It is on record that Dr Fayemi contested a primary election on the platform of the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria, ACN, and the primary election was rigged in his favour. This prompted 17 other aspirants in the party to pull out as a protest against the fraudulent election. He eventually became the Governor of Ekiti State through a manipulated judicial victory,” he added. The opposition party also alleged that Fayemi also got his second term ticket through a very rancorous and controversial primary election. “The primary election had to be conducted twice because aggrieved party members had to violently disrupt the primary election over the allegation that Fayemi was manipulating the whole process. The general election was seriously rigged against the PDP gubernatorial candidate in 2018,” he said. Adeyanju added that Governor Fayemi has not supervised any free primary election as the Governor of Ekiti State.
