The Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Forum of Vice-Chairmen nationwide, Azua Ashongo has said each and every Nigerian has had a “full dose of the bitter pill of the misrule and incurably bad leadership provided by the All Progressives Congress (APC). Ashongo stated this while delivering a speech at the inaugural meeting of the forum held in Abuja on Friday, saying, the citizens are tired of APC’s misrule and are now looking up to PDP to rescue them in 2023. He charged his colleagues to go beyond the party membership to work assiduously in mobilising other general voters. He enjoined them to work as a team with the leadership of the party in their various states to avoid unnecessary frictions and bad blood, stressing that “Party Chairmen in local governments under our watch are very critical stakeholders in the Rescue Agenda of our party in the 2023 elections and beyond. We must, collectively integrate them in the running of the party for more cohesive and fruitful election outcomes.” Ashongo said, “Like our National Chairman, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu said recently, ours is a true democratic party and not a party of pretenders and hypocrites who are destroying our people and making life impossible for them; our economy has gone comatose; insecurity climaxing, hunger expanding and poverty ravaging. “Our people must hear this and make a choice and, they sure, have only one choice to make. And that choice is to vote PDP back to power in 2023.”
