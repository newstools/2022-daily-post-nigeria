Nigerian celebrities have slammed the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government as students across the country continue to stay at home following the lingering Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), strike. ASUU embarked on a one-month warning strike on February 14, 2022, but it was extended on March 14 by two months over some unresolved agreements. Since February, ASUU and the Buhari-led government have held several meetings, but no agreement has been reached to find solution to the ongoing strike Despite the ASUU strike, the Minister of State for Education, Mr Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba bought the APC presidential nomination form worth N100m, a development that has since been condemned. Lamenting the fate of students following incessant strike, Yemi Alade via her Twitter handle said the government had ailed the youth. Yemi Alade “Our government has failed us,
students are still at home.” Teni Makanaki also took to Twitter writing: “ASUU free them kids (students)! What the h***.”
