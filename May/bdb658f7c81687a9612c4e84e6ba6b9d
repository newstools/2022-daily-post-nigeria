Farouk Adamu Aliyu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has declared that he would not withdraw his ambition for any of those aspiring to become candidates of the ruling party in the state. He stated this on Thursday in Dutse, Jigawa State while declaring his intention to contest for governorship under the APC platform. Responding to questions from journalists, he called on the state governor Muhammad Badaru Abubakar to fear God and be a man of his words by not throwing his weight on any of the intending aspirants after claiming he had no anointed candidate. He added that the Governor should allow for fair primaries, saying part of the things he will do differently from Badaru’s regime is that there will be reward and punishment. He said under Badaru many people have crossed red lines and have not been punished “but I will punish anyone that crosses the redline. That is what I will do differently from Badaru” he stated.
