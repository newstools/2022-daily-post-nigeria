A presidential aspirant under the platform of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) Olufemi Ajadi, has withdrawn from the 2023 race, to support the former Kano State Governor, Rabiu Kwankwaso. Ajadi, at a press conference he addressed at the NUJ secretariat, Okelewo, Abeokuta, said he has stepped down to be the running mate of Kwakwanso, who is also eyeing the presidential seat. The entrepreneur said: “Ladies and gentlemen, I Olufemi Ajadi Oguntoyinbo, having considered many things, and in the interest of our great party and beloved country, today, relinquish my presidential ambition, to support the presidential candidacy of Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso as his running mate.” The aspirant said this was done in the interest of the party and the nation, saying, “Senator Kwakwanso is a great Nigerian, an accomplished politician and administrator who will lift this country.” Speaking about the state of the nation, Ajadi regretted that nothing was working well in the nation. “Nigeria is a country that God Himself has blessed, but look around you today, you will agree with me that things are not working well. “There is hunger in the land, despite Nigeria having arable land and varieties of foods and crops. “There is insecurity in the country, despite an elected government, with the police, the Army, the Navy and the Air force “Our children finish school and there are no jobs. Is it a wonder that there is crime everywhere? Roads are in terrible condition. There is no public water supply, no electricity and all the basic necessities of life. But we have a government. We have billions of Naira in cash and assets. I now ask, What is the missing link? “Distinguished Nigerians, the missing link is selfless, sincere, and servant-based leadership, guided by the highest sense of equity and fairness. That is what we in the NNPP have come to offer,” he explained.
