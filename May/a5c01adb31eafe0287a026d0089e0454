Basking in the euphoria of the Supreme Court judgment which dismissed former Governor Rotimi Amaechi’s suit on N96B indictment, Rivers State Governor, Nyemsom Wike, has said that the coast has become clear for elders of the state to determine the fate of the former governor. Wike asserted that as a person, he would not take any action on the report of Justice George Omekeji Commission of Inquiry, which indicted Amaechi for alleged massive fraud without the direction of Rivers Leaders. In his reaction to the Friday judgment of the apex court, Wike, flanked by his political associates said the leaders of the State will meet to decide on the fate of Amaechi over the misappropriation of N96billion belonging to the State. Wike thanked the judiciary for stabilizing the country’s democracy. “If leaders of the State say we must prosecute the former governor and those indicted by the Commission of Inquiry, I will have no problem with that. “By Monday, I will direct the Attorney General of the state to file charges against him (Amaechi) and others found culpable in the fraud once I receive elders’ advice to do that. “I’m not being vindictive, but at the same time, I have been vindicated. “It is for the leaders of the state to meet and decide on what to do next. “There is nobody that sees the report and recommendation of the panel of Inquiry that will not cry for Rivers and its people. “Remember, Amaechi was not to be cleared by the Senate for Ministerial appointment but a government that says it is fighting corruption was pressured and he was cleared. “I have to consult the leaders of the state on what to do next. If they say, prosecute them, on Monday, the Rivers Government will file charges against Amaechi and others,” Wike stated. “Imagine that the sum of $50million dollars was paid to Sahara Energy Company that belongs to Tonye Cole, etc,” Wike lamented.
