Two men were on Wednesday docked in an Akure Magistrate’s Court for allegedly stealing a businessman’s international passport. The police charged Moses Zindu, a commercial motorcyclist; and Sola Oluwole, a trader with conspiracy and theft. The Prosecution Counsel, Insp Mary Adebayo, told the court that the defendants stole an envelope containing the international passport of Mr Olalekan Kolejo. Adebayo said that the defendants committed the offence on May 1 at Alagbaka, Akure at 5:55 pm. The offence, she said, contravened the provisions of Section 383 and is punishable under Section 390( 9) of the Criminal Code Cap 37, Vol. 1, Law of Ondo State. The prosecutor, therefore, prayed for an adjournment to enable her to study the case file. The Defence Counsel, Mr Oladele Oladejo, prayed the court to grant his clients bail in the most liberal terms. Oladejo said that the suspects were presumed to be innocent, hence, they should not be deprived of their rights as enshrined in the Nigerian constitution. Magistrate Folasade Aduroja admitted the defendants to bail in the sum of N500,000 each. Aduroja adjourned the case until May 18 for a hearing. (NAN)
