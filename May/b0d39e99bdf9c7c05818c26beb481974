Former Aide-de-Camp to General Sani Abacha, Major Hamza Al-Mustapha (retd), said if elected as Nigeria’s president in 2023, he would relocate to the dreaded Sambisa forest. Al-Mustapha boasted that he will end the protracted Boko Haram insurgency bedeviling the country in six months. Al-Mustapha also said, he will relocate to the notorious Sambisa forest which is believed to the strong hold of Boko Haram terrorists in Borno state for one week, where strategies would be initiated and implemented aimed at ending the menace once and for all. The former ADC disclosed this on Friday in an interview with BBC Hausa service on a wide range of issues, which was monitored by DAILY POST. He expressed dissatisfaction on the way Nigerian soldiers are operating without ‘patriotism, zeal, commitment and passion’ to the defence of the nation unlike before. His words, “Nigerian soldiers have now become police and you know how corrupt our police are. So, within these six months, I will bring sanity into the way the Nigerian military operates to be able to confront emerging security threats with renewed vigour and commitment.” Al-Mustapha, who is aspiring for Nigeria’s number seat come 2023 on the platform of Action Alliance, AA, lamented over the alarming level of insecurity in the country. He alleged that President Muhammadu Buhari is surrounded by sycophants and corrupt politicians who have done great damage to his administration. “Those surrounding him are the problem of this country,” he said. He equally blamed President Buhari for not checking the activities of those whom he had delegated power to them, saying when he becomes the next president of the country; check and balance, due process and strict adherence to the rule of law would be the cardinal principles of his administration without fear or favour.
