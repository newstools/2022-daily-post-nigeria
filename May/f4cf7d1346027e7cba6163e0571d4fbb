Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe has dumped the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Abaribe also resigned as the Minority Leader in the upper chamber of the National Assembly. Recall that Abaribe who was an Abia governorship hopeful, withdrew from the PDP governorship primaries on Tuesday. He confirmed his defection in a letter to the ward chairman of the PDP in the Obingwa Local Government Area of Abia State and the President of the Senate in the National Assembly, Ahmed Lawan. Abaribe gave ‘illegality, impunity, and hesitations in decision-making’ as reasons for dumping the PDP. “This development is consequent upon the shameful display of illegality, impunity and undemocratic decision of the party and after due consultations with my constituents,” he added. His letter to Senator Lawan Ahmed, read in part, “This is to notify you and my dear colleagues in the Senate that I have formally resigned my membership of the Peoples Democratic Party through my ward. This also means my resignation as (the) Minority Leader of the Senate. “I wish to thank you and my dear colleagues in the leadership of the Senate for the warm camaraderie we enjoyed while I was Minority Leader.”
