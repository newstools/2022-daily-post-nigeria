Former Ghana forward, Charles Asampong Taylor, has claimed former Nigeria international, Taribo West, threatened to break his leg during a 2002 World Cup qualifier in Accra. Taylor, who was in impressive form at the time, started the game against the Super Eagles in 2001. Despite fielding a team of mostly home-based players, the Black Stars held a star-studded Super Eagles team to a 0-0 draw. “I was afraid when I saw Okocha, Nwankwo Kanu, and the likes because they were playing for big teams in Europe. “But I overcame that fear when after the first half I realized that the Nigerians were afraid of me. “I remember Taribo West asked the team I play for in Europe. Upon telling him that I play for Hearts of Oak, he threatened to break my leg if I keep dribbling them,” Taylor said in an interview with Dan Kweku Yeboah TV on YouTube. Both teams met again in Port Harcourt and the Eagles won thanks to a Tijani Babangida brace and a goal from Victor Agali. The win saw Nigeria qualify for the 2002 edition of the World Cup co-hosted by South Korea and Japan.
