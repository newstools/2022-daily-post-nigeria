Jigawa State Governor, Muhammad Badaru Abubakar, has directed for the immediate reinstatement of suspended Yankwashi Local Government chairman, Mubarak Ahmed Achilafiya. This was contained in a press release signed by the Commissioner Ministry for Local Government, Alh Kabiru Hassan Sugungun. DAILY POST reported that Jigawa State House of Assembly had indefinitely suspended Achilafiya for alleged disloyalty to the state chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC. The statement further explained that the directive has superseded previous directives which gives the vice-chairman the power to take over of the council. The Commissioner, however, appealed to all parties concerned to live in peace with one another for the development of the state.
