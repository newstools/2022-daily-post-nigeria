President Muhammadu Buhari has been urged to replace the Attorney-General of the Federation, AGF, and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami with Festus Keyamo, and Rotimi Amaechi with Gbemisola Saraki as the Minister of Transportation. Some Nigerians made the call following Buhari’s directive to his Ministers with political ambition to resign. Buhari, at the Federal Executive Council, FEC, meeting on Wednesday, told cabinet members who have declared their political ambition to resign before Monday 16th of May. This directive affects the following cabinet members, Malami; the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; Minister of Science and Technology, Ogbonnaya Onu; Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige; Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva. Following the directive, Amaechi, Nwajiuba; Godswill Akpabio, Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, and Ogbonnaya Onu, minister of science and technology, have resigned their appointments. However, some Nigerians noted that Keyamo was better positioned to replace Malami as the country’s chief law officer. Comments DAILY POST gathered from Twitter read below: @DOlusegun: “Festus Keyamo should be deployed to Ministry of Justice when Malami resigns.” @OvieNews: “Gbemisola Saraki will become the new Minister of Transportation and Festus Keyamo the Minister of Labour and Employment.” @Oritzjaja: “Keyamo would be a natural replacement for Malami being somebody that is knowledgable about the law, looking at his past antecedents.” @Lanbano: “I pick Keyamo to replace Malami that has really tried to destroy Nigeria’s judiciary system. Keyamo would be a better replacement.” @Ejirooghene: “I think I would subscribe to Keyamo replacing Malami; that man has done more harm than good to the judiciary system in this country.”
