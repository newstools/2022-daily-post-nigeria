Calvin Bassey remains committed to Rangers despite persistent rumours linking him with a move away from the Scottish Premiership club. Bassey has been one of the top performers for the Gers this season. Naturally, a left-back, the Nigerian has slotted perfectly into the centre-back position. The 22-year-old earned huge plaudits from pundits and former players following his superlative showing in Rangers’ UEFA Europa League final defeat to Bundesliga club Eintracht Frankfurt in midweek. Bassey was also at his marauding best as Giovanni van Bronckhorst’s side captured the Scottish Cup crown on Saturday courtesy of a 2-0 win against Hearts at the Hampden Park. “It’s unbelievable. I think the boys have been excellent this season, worked so hard, to come back from the disappointment of Wednesday in extra-time, it shows the character of the players, we got our reward,” Bassey told the BBC Sports. “I thank God and thank my team-mates. It’s not a one man team. Without them I would not be where I am. “I’m focused here. I’m getting ready to come back in pre-season fitter than I was last season.” Bassey joined Rangers from Premier League club Leicester City in June 2020. He has two years remaining on his contract with the Ibrox outfit.
