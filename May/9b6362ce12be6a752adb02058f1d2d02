The Authority of Nigerian Army on Tuesday, described the killing of two soldiers by IPOB/ESN, as callous and despicable. Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, Director Army Public Relations, in a statement on Tuesday, said the Nigerian Army on Saturday, April 30, 2022 received information on the gruesome murder of two soldiers; Master Warrant Officer (MWO) Audu M Linus (retired) and Private (Pte) Gloria Matthew, by Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its armed affiliate, Eastern Security Network (ESN). According to him, the soldiers were killed while embarked on the trip to fulfill the traditional rites of conjugating their matrimony, as the very well respected and cherished Igbo tradition demands He said though, one of the soldiers, Pte Gloria Matthew hails from Nkwerre LGA of Imo State, did not prevail on the sensibility of the dissidents, adding that the dastardly act, clearly portends the deep seated hate, desperation and lawlessness with which foot soldiers of IPOB/ESN have being unleashing terror on Ndigbo, whom they claimed, are on a mission to protect and emancipate, as well as other innocent Nigerians who are resident or transiting the South East. He said the NA will ensure the perpetrators of this dastardly act unleashed on its personnel do not go unpunished, just as it condoled with the families, relations and close associates of the victims. While enjoining members of the public to oblige security agencies with actionable information that will lead to the arrest of these criminals, he said the NA has commenced investigation to unmask and bring the criminals to book.
