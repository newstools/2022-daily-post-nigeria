Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State has said that the South-East and North-East have the most legitimate claim to the presidency in 2023. Mohammed, a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant, said this on Friday in Awka during his consultation with the party faithful in Anambra. He contended that the two geo-political zones had yet to produce the nation’s president in a democratic dispensation. He said: “The Igbo nation is critical in the Nigerian project. “Their entrepreneurial ingenuity and apprenticeship should be imbibed by other parts of the country as a model for addressing poverty and unemployment.’’ He, however, said he would support whosoever emerged as candidate from the primary in order to ensure that PDP wrestled power from the ruling-All Progressives Congress. He said, “I am presenting myself for election and I seek your support. “But if I do not win, I will support the eventual candidate because we have to rescue Nigeria.” The presidential hopeful said he was duty bound to accept the outcome of the primary election as a true party man.
