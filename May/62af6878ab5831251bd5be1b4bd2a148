Former Tottenham Hotspur striker, Darren Bent, has urged incoming Manchester United new manager, Erik Ten Hag, to sign Yves Bissouma from Brighton & Hove Albion this summer. Bent believes Bissouma would improve Manchester United under Ten Hag next season if the Red Devils sign him. According to him, the 25-year-old is an ideal midfielder who can fit into Man United’s system for next season when Ten Hag replaces Rangnick. Speaking to TalkSPORT, Darren said, “Listen, they should have got a holding midfielder. They should have got one a while ago. I don’t think they are going to stump up the money (for Rice) – West Ham is likely to hold onto him. Someone I would really like to see them a sign, I think he’s a really good player, Yves Bissouma.” He added: “I think he’s a top player, I think he is gettable as well, I think he would improve Manchester United because he is not just your average box-to-box he can get about he is a top midfielder. I would probably go out to get him.”
