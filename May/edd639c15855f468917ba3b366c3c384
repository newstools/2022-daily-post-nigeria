Former Liverpool attacker, Stan Collymore has urged Marcus Rashford to get out of Manchester United this summer. Collymore believes Man United is not a home for Rashford anymore, adding that he should leave the Red Devils and become a hero in another club. Rashford has struggled for form this season and has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford. Speaking to Caught Offside, Collymore named four clubs the England international could sign for to get his career back on track. “I could not tell you, having watched Rashford play a thousand times, what he really does well, what he really does poorly and what his role in the team is anymore. That is a damning indictment on Manchester United Football Club – so get out, Marcus,” Collymore said. He continued: “The two or three (clubs Rashford should sign for) are Spurs (for the prospect of Champions League football), West Ham, absolutely – Wolves, no brainer and (Aston) Villa. I think those are four clubs he could add significantly to. Find a home, all big clubs and become a hero,” he added.
