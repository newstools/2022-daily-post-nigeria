Sky Bet Championship club, Cardiff City are set to complete the signing of Nigeria defender Jamilu Collins on a free transfer. Collins, according to WalesOnline is expected to undergo medicals at the club on Thursday (today). An announcement is expected to be made in the next 48 hours pending the outcome of his medicals. Collins recently severed ties with Bundesliga 2 outfit SC Paderborn following the expiration of his contract with the modest club. The left-back spent five years at SC Paderborn, scoring two goals in 127 league appearances for the club. Cardiff City have already signed three players; winger Ollie Tanner, goalkeeper Jak Alnwick and midfielder Ebou Adams and want to make Collins their fourth acquisition. The Bluebirds are particularly enticed with the player’s versatility, given he can play multiple roles (centre-back, wing-back and left-hand side of midfield). The 27-year-old has made 11 appearances for Nigeria. He was part of Super Eagles squad that won bronze at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.
