Social commentator, Chima Christian believes the real cause of Kano explosion is being concealed by federal and state authorities. The incident claimed many lives and injured an unknown number of persons. The casualty figure may rise. Nine bodies of school children were deposited at the Armed Forces Hospital on Tuesday. In a statement on Wednesday, Christian accused the Governments of Nigeria and Kano of lying. “There are attempts to manage the narratives around the explosion in Sabon-Gari area of Kano State”, the activist said. “It is both a revelation and a confirmation that the Nigerian State is aware of the precarious situation at hand. “By sowing seeds of doubt as to the cause of the explosion, authorities inadvertently admitted their awareness that Nigeria is only one spark away from a total collapse of order. “May that spark not happen till we fully defuse both the gas cylinder, bomb or whatever this explosive device called Nigeria is.” Christian further urged the authorities to pay attention to the situation in Dei Dei Market in Abuja. The violence started after a woman reportedly fell from a commercial motorbike (Okada) and was crushed by a trailer. The burning of the bike triggered a riot as Okada riders attacked shops at the building materials market.
