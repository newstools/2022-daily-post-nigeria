Everton manager, Frank Lampard has hailed his team’s fighting spirit after they came from two goals down to beat Crystal Palace 3-2 on Thursday night. Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s diving header, with five minutes left, extended the Toffees’ proud 71-year stay in the top flight. His goal completed a comeback started by Michael Keane’s finish and Richarlison’s sixth goal in nine games. Lampard said: “What we’ve just seen, it’s Premier League safety, it’s not Champions League. But what it means to the club and circumstances they were given in. “The character of this club, the fans, players, just got us through. The spirit of the club was immense. “There are a lot of people who work so hard for that, the players, the board, the fans, my staff. It’s a huge night for Everton and now we want to take that forward.”
