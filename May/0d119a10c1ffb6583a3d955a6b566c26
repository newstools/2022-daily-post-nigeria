The Oyo State Government has advised members of the Park Management System (PMS) not to consume any form of intoxicants while on duty. The government gave this advice on Sunday. Our correspondent recalls that the PMS was created shortly after the state government led by Mr. Seyi Makinde prohibited activities of National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) in the state. The government has, however, warned officials of the PMS against consuming all forms of intoxicants. It stated that intoxicants such as cocaine, cannabis, heroin, codeine, opioids, tobacco indian hemp and tramadol should not be consumed by the officials while on duty. Commissioner for public works, infrastructure and transportation, Professor Dahud Sangodoyin made these disclosures while speaking in Ibadan. Sangodoyin, who said that no official of PMS must hold canes, sticks or rods while on duty, added that the regulations are parts of the new standard operating procedure for PMS. He added that all officials of PMS must adhere to the new regulations. “No member of the PMS must drive recklessly and negligently whether on duty or otherwise. No member of PMS is allowed to drink any form of liquor or intoxicant substances while on duty. “The guidelines also prohibit members of the PMS from consuming any form of prohibited hard drugs such as cocaine, cannabis, refnol, heroin, codeine, opioids, tobacco indian hemp, tramadol among others. “The guidelines further provide that no member of PMS must hold canes, sticks or rods while on duty, just as they are expected to as Civil as possible and ensure that commuters rights are well protected.”
