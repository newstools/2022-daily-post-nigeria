Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba’s possible next club after snubbing Manchester City has been revealed. Pogba had reportedly told Manchester City he will move elsewhere when his contract with Man United expires this summer. However, according to Fabrizio Romano, Paris Saint-Germain are still in the race to sign Pogba, while the player’s representatives are holding a meeting with Juventus to sign the France international. Romano disclosed this in a tweet via his Twitter handle on Monday. He wrote: “Meeting still ongoing between Paul Pogba’s agents and Juventus in Turin as expected, with Raiola group’s lawyer Rafaela Pimenta taking care of the negotiations. “Pogba has already turned down Man City approaches, while there’s Paris Saint-Germain still in the race.” Pogba has struggled for consistency as Man United have continued to underperform following the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson.
