Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has emphasized that the value of labour cannot be shoved aside in any government’s success. On the occasion of the 2022 Workers’ Day Celebration, Akeredolu commended the State’s workers and lauded the civil servants’ perseverance and dedication, which he said had resulted in optimum service delivery to the people of the State. The Governor commended the State’s organized labor leadership for their sustained maturity, understanding, and support, particularly during these trying times. “The workers are the strong engine room of every government. Their contributions to the success of any administration cannot be over-emphasized. “It is in recognition of the importance of our workers that this administration has continued to place premium on their welfare. “We have set aside the obnoxious practice which encouraged partisan politics and truncate the careers of committed public servants. Our administration has in the last five years, determined the promotion of public servant on merit. These promotion exercises are regular and timely. “While we are optimistic that better days await us, we shall not shy away from performing our avowed responsibilities. “We shall keep exploring every available means to ensure that we meet our obligations of paying workers salaries, pensions and gratuities, and subventions as and when due, despite the paucity of fund and the dwindling federal allocation,” he said.
