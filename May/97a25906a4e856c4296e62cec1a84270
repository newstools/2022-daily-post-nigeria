The All Progressives Congress (APC) has cleared twelve Benue State aspirants, ahead of the Friday governorship primary election in the state. Mr Dan Morgan-Ihomun, the state APC Publicity Secretary, said this when he spoke with newsmen on Monday in Makurdi. Morgan-Ihomun promised that there would be no manipulations at the governorship primaries, insisting that all aspirants would be given a level playing field. “There will be a level playing field for every aspirant in order to elect the best candidate,” Morgan-Ihomun said. “It’s the delegates that will elect who will be our candidate for the 2023 governorship election. “We do not have a preferred candidate, whoever they elect for our party he will be acceptable.” According to Morgan-Ihomun, about 1, 517 delegates would take part in the Friday primaries. The aspirants cleared included former Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Michael Aondoakaa, Mr Terwase Orbunde, former Chief of Staff to Gov. Samuel Ortom and Mr Herman Hembe. Others were Mr Sam Ode, Chief Steven Lawani, Mr Mathias Byuan, Chief Barnabas Gemade and Prof. Terhemba Shija.
