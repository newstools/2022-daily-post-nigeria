Chelsea is monitoring Robert Lewandowski’s situation at Bayern Munich and may rival Barcelona for his signature this season. Lewandowski has publicly informed the Bundesliga club that he is not renewing his contract. The 33-year-old has just one year left on his current deal and wants a fresh challenge. Barca is targeting a deal but they would have to find a way to avoid LaLiga’s Financial Fair Play (FFP) sanctions. The Spanish giants are also concerned that Thomas Tuchel’s personal interest could play a part in the Polish striker’s decision. Currently, Chelsea is sanctioned and unable to make transfers – but that’s projected to end soon, with the Todd Boehly takeover into the final administrative details. After that, they will begin planning their summer, as they are already behind most of Europe’s big clubs who have started to make moves for new players.
