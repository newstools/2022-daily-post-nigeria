Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, has thrown his weight behind the N100 million price tag for the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential nomination forms. Akpabio said any serious presidential aspirant would cough out the money without going to the bank. He spoke while appearing on Channels Television’s Politics Today on Thursday. The minister explained that a serious presidential aspirant should have people who could raise such an amount. According to Akpabio: “As far as he is concerned, the N100m fee is a fair deal, explaining that the aspirants do not necessarily need to raise the money themselves. “The N100m in my view is very fair. You see, even in modern democracies like America, it is not the candidate that sends himself into presidential elections; it is the people. “So, when you talk about Nigeria, just 100 Nigerians bringing out N1m will give you N100m. “I want to think that any serious presidential candidate does not need to go into his bank account and bring out N100m because you are not the person going to vote for yourself.” APC presidential aspirants like the Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Bola Tinubu, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, Minister of State for Education; Pastor Tunde Bakare and others have obtained their forms.
