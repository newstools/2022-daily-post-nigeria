The founder of the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), Ralph Uwazuruike, has said there is no serious Presidential aspirant from the South-East. Uwazuruike said most of the Presidential aspirants from the zone are jostling for the Vice President slot. He described them as pretenders. In a statement he issued, the MASSOB founder said most Presidential aspirants from the South-East were lobbying the North for the Vice President slot. He said: “No Igbo man is contesting for the presidency. All these people you are seeing are pretenders. “No Igbo man, let them swear, all of them, that they are not going to the North to lobby for vice president. “People have called me from the North telling me that all those clamouring to be president are the ones seeking to be vice presidents. I laughed because I know them. “None of these people you are supporting today are serious. They are all looking for vice president; all of them, from A to Z, I challenge them. They are pretenders.” The race for the 2023 Presidency has some contenders from the South-East, like Peter Obi, former Anambra State governor; Chris Ngige, Minister for Labour and Employment; Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, Minister of State for Education; Orji Uzor Kalu, Senate Chief Whip; and Rochas Okorocha, Imo West Senator.
