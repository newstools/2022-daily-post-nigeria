The Emir of Ringim, in Jigawa State, Abubakar Sayyadi Mahmoud has said the proper implementation of girl child education policy would bring a solution to Nigeria’s problems. The Emir, represented by the Chiroma of Ringim Emirate council and Chief Counsellor, Usman Sayyadi Mahmoud said this on Monday when he received education development partners in his office, Ringim. He said the importance of girl-child education in the development of a society cannot be overemphasized. “This Emirate is always advocating for education, especially for the girl child, because we believed it is the only solution to the current social problems of drugs abuse, and other insecurities bedevilling the country” “Ignorance among mothers is the cause of all these problems because when you educate a girl it is like educating the whole society” the Emir stated. He, however, promised to collaborate with all the development partners to enlighten his communities on the importance of girl child education for the development of the country. Earlier the Chairman, Education Development Partners, Tasi’u Abubakar said the advocacy visit to traditional leaders is aimed at addressing girl education issues in Jigawa State. He said despite the numerous efforts by state and non-state actors on girl education, there are still persistent issues hindering girls’ enrolment, retention, transition and completion in schools. He said some of the persistent issues include, Socio-cultural barriers, economic barriers, funding and releases and governance/administrative issues. Tasi’u noted that traditional rulers and religious leaders have a greater role to play in addressing the problem.
