Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta, has reacted to Manchester City’s acquisition of Europe’s top striker, Erling Haaland from Borussia Dortmund. Manchester City announced during the week that 21-year-old Norway international will join the club this summer after agreements were reached. Reacting to the news, Arteta said the Gunners must continue to try and close the gap on City. Pep Guardiola’s side beat competitions from Chelsea, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Barcelona to sign the 21-year-old for a fee around £55 million. Arteta, however, expects all the sides at the top of the table to strengthen heavily this summer, insisting Arsenal have plans underway to ensure they are not left behind. Asked about Haaland’s imminent arrival in Manchester, which was confirmed by City this week, Arteta told a press conference: “We expect every team is going to reinforce and get better every single year. “It has been the case the last three or four years in particular. The standards and the levels of the top teams in the league is unprecedented in Premier League history. “That is the level and it will only get more difficult and that is the planning we have to try and bet at that level.” [sic]. Manchester City and Liverpool have dominated the last five seasons in the Premier League while Arsenal are struggling to return to finish fourth place and have the chance of playing in the Champions League next season. The Gunners are currently fourth in the Premier League with Tottenham breathing down their neck and both sides meet on Thursday in a rescheduled league game that will prove decisive for the north London sides. A win for Arsenal will cement their place in fourth and guarantee them a Champions League place while Tottenham will close the gap to one point with a victory.
