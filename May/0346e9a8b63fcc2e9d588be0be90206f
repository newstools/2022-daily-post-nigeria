Senator representing Ondo North Senatorial district, Robert Ajayi Boroffice Saturday formally declared his ambition to contest the 2023 presidential election. Addressing a mammoth crowd of supporters in Abuja, he said pre-colonial challenges were still facing Nigeria 61 years after independence, a development that is a disappointment. He said: “It is quite unsettling to me, to you and indeed many Nigerians that 61 years after independence, Nigeria is still grappling with the basic problems that dogged the pre-independence era despite enormous human and natural resources. “I can still recall when I usually recited the beautiful lyrics of our National Anthem with utmost enthusiasm in 1960 and thereafter, I loved it and I lived it, particularly the line that says “though tribes and tongues may differ, in brotherhood, we stand.” He recalled reciting the lyrics of Nigeria’s ‘National Anthem’ which was a sort of inspiration to him but lamented the nebulous development that Nigerians have lived with since independence. He pointed out that citizens haven’t been living together and there wasn’t inter-ethnic cooperation, which he asserted was contributory to the interruption of democracy for a long time. The lawmaker, however, paid tributes to the heroes past and present who were committed to Nigeria’s development, particularly those who ensured that Nigeria returned to democracy in 1999. Boroffice who is the deputy majority leader of the 9th Senate is a third timer in the upper legislative chamber on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). He is among the three Senators aspiring to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023
