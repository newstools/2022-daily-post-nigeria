Governor Darius Dickson Ishaku of Taraba State has claimed that apart from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the dream of any other political party salvaging the country, will continue to be a mirage. The governor who stated this on Monday in Jalingo the state capital, while playing host to the former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, said until the country has a shift in leadership, the dream of attaining the much-needed growth, would continue to slip off our fingers. Describing Nigeria as a “big elephant that cannot produce anything for herself, he said the PDP remains the only political party that can bring Nigerians out of the dungeon of poverty. Stressing how his desire to catapult the state to the height is most often frustrated, he said such inaction would not deter him from carrying out the much-desired development in the rural areas of the state. Earlier, Peter Obi, a Presidential aspirant of the PDP, who was in the state to canvass support from delegates and critical party stakeholders, identified poverty, and lack of investment as the major causes of crimes in the country. Stressing that the “debts we have in this country cannot be paid, he said the more you push people out of poverty, the more you reduce crimes.” Obi who admitted that it has become relevant to move the country from “sharing formula to producing formula said Nigeria as a nation needs the support of small scale businesses to survive. In actualizing this, the Nigerian youths who are talented and have the strength to turn the fortunes of the country around, needs our support, he said. Sad that Nigeria has the highest number of people leaving in poverty and the highest number of unemployed youths, he expressed sadness that hen you wake up every morning, you hear of killings stressing that “Nigeria has experienced leadership failure within the year”.
