A notorious armed robber, 42-year-old Taye Fumble, known for terrorising road users in Modakeke, Ife, Ilesa-Ibadan Expressway, has been arrested and paraded by operatives of the Western Nigeria Security Network Agency, Osun Amotekun. Parading the Modakeke indigene on Saturday in Osogbo, the Osun Amotekun revealed that the suspect was arrested on Friday after he and his gang members, who are now at large, attempted to hijack a truck-load of goods. Speaking through its Media Officer, Yusuf Idowu, the Osun Amotekun said its operatives who were on patrol saw them operating on the road. Idowu revealed that, “When they sighted our personnel, they ran and started engaging the Amotekun personnel in a gun duel. “The other robbers escaped in the truck with the goods but luck ran against them when trying to escape with the goods at Ile-ife. The robbers and Amotekun also engaged in another face-off which lasted for more than an hour. “It was during the gunfire that one of them was disarmed and apprehended. “The suspect confessed that he had been operating with other gang members on the road for a long time before luck ran against him.” Idowu also stated that the suspect had been transferred to the appropriate authority for discreet investigation and prosecution.
