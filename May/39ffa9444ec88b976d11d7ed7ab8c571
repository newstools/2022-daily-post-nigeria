The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) on Monday extended its ongoing strike for another 12 weeks. This was disclosed in a statement signed by ASUU president, Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke. Osodeke said this was to give the government enough time to satisfactorily resolve all the outstanding issues. The roll-over strike takes effect from 12:01 a.m. on May 8, 2021. The decision was taken after the ASUU National Executive Council meeting which started on Sunday night at the Comrade Festus Iyayi National Secretariat, University of Abuja. At the meeting, ASUU accused the Federal Government of being unserious. ASUU is demanding the release of revitalization funds for universities, renegotiation and implementation of the 2009 FGN/ASUU agreement.
