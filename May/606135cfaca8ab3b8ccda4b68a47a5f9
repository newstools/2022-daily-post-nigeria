Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, has warned Russian soldiers to save their lives amid the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia. Zelensky said it is better for Russian soldiers to survive in Russia than perish in Ukraine as Russian forces are trying to ramp up pressure on Ukrainian forces in the eastern Donbas region. The 44-year-old said this in his nightly video address on Saturday evening, according to BBC. Zelensky also said the Russian soldiers are “gathering additional forces for new attacks there [Donbas]”, adding that he had a defiant message that he addressed directly to Russian soldiers. He said, “It’s better for you to survive in Russia than to perish on our soil. “We know that the Russian command is preparing for new big losses. In those units, whose personnel were weakened in March-April, new people are being recruited with little motivation and little combat experience. “Every Russian soldier can save his own life,” he added. The war between Russia and Ukraine started in February and several casualties have since been recorded as a result of the war.
