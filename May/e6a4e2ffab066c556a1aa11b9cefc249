AC Milan forward, Rafael Leao, has named teammate Zlatan Ibrahimovic among his five footballing idols while growing up. Leao insisted that Ibrahimovic would kill him if he did not mention him among his idols in football. The 22-year-old also named Barcelona legend Ronaldinho, Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo and Paris Saint-Germain duo, Kylian Mbappe and Neymar as his idols. He said this during a live session on his Instagram page, where he answered questions from his fans. One fan asked him to list his footballing idols, to which the former Lille man replied: “Ronaldo, Mbappé, Neymar, Ronaldinho. I must also say Ibrahimovic, if I don’t talk about him he’ll kill me.” Leao has been in brilliant form for AC Milan so far this season. He has scored 10 goals and provided seven assists in 32 Serie A matches for Milan this season.
