The Institute for Peace and Conflict Resolution (IPCR) has condemned the killing of Deborah Samuel, who was a student at the College of Education in Sokoto over alleged blasphemy. The IPCR called for calm and sued for peaceful co-existence among citizens, noting in a press statement that Nigerians are family. “We are brothers and sisters, who should be living together as siblings devoid of violence and hate.” The Institute, however, commended the Sokoto State government for already taking measures to address the situation, while still calling on it not to relax or give any chance until peace is restored in the state. The Institute also appealed for tolerance, insisting it is the only way peaceful co-existence and harmony can be guaranteed. It stressed that the country has gone through several challenges and in this period of electioneering, what Nigeria needs more is tolerance and peace if the nation must move forward. The Director-General, Dr. Bakut T. Bakut said all hands must be on deck to assist the nation to achieve its desired peace. Nigeria cannot afford another difficult circumstance that will further strain the nation’s fragile security situation. Bakut said: “We appeal that our youths should be educated by all stakeholders on the danger of violence and taking laws into their hands, as this will only escalate the present crisis situation. “We, therefore, call on all relevant authorities to bring the perpetrators to book to serve as a deterrent to others, who would want to toe such path.”
