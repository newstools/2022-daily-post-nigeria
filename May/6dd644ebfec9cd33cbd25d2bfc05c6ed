Former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, on Thursday, blamed the dwindling security of Nigeria which has led to wanton destruction of lives and property to leadership failure. Saraki, who made this known in Jalingo, Taraba State while interacting with delegates and stakeholders of the state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), felt sad that Nigeria as a nation, has gone through so much. He said, “We can not have the same type of leaders tomorrow as we have today. It is about the future of this country and our children. We need to do things differently.” Wondering why the present leadership of the country under the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has not been able to addressed the predicaments bedeviling the country, the nation, in his view, needs a “competent” leader to rescue Nigeria. Saraki, who took steps further to admit that the country has been so divided, Nigerians, in his opinion, he believed “cannot afford to use sentiments to vote.” While stressing that bad leadership is responsible for the present insecurity, he pleaded for all hands to be on deck in order to right the wrongs, soliciting that “We must do it right for the sake of those who died for no fault of theirs.” Earlier, the state governor, Arc. Darius Dickson Ishaku, who also agreed with what Saraki said, lamented the present state to the country.
He admitted that “We need someone that will fix insecurity and bring investment.” Saraki is one of the fifteen presidential aspirants jostling for the sole presidential ticket of the PDP for 2023 general elections.
