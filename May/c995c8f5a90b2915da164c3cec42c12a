Outgoing Philippines President, Rodrigo Duterte, has hit out at Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin for killing innocent civilians, including children and the elderly, in Ukraine. Duterte said Putin should control his soldiers in Ukraine, adding he started the ruckus in Ukraine. He said this during a public address on Monday night, according to the state-run Philippines News Agency (PNA). “A lot of people are saying that Putin and I are the same because we kill people,” said Duterte. “But I kill criminals. I do not kill children and the elderly. What is happening in Russia and America is different from what is happening here.” He added, “Putin is my friend. You are in control of everything. Anyway, you really started the ruckus there. Control your soldiers. They are running amok.” “The embassy of Russia, if you are listening, I am not picking a quarrel with anybody. I said Putin is a friend of mine. “But … it is your moral obligation to see to it that the civilians, the innocent ones, children, the elderly, the women … They are too vulnerable.”
