The Nigeria Midstream Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Agency (NMDPRA) has shut down two filling stations in Kogi State for hoarding and selling above Federal Government approved pump price of N165 per litre. The two filing stations sealed by the regulatory agency are Masters Energy located at Kporoka a suburb of the Lokoja metropolis and Mak-Tok, located in Otokiti Village, Lokoja, Kogi State. DAILY POST gathered that Master Energy was caught selling fuel for N230 per litre while Mak-Tok was sanctioned for hoarding the product. Speaking to journalists on Friday after monitoring the sales of Premium Motor Spirit, popularly called petrol, in Lokoja, the Kogi State Co-ordinator, NMDPRA Engr. Ogbe Orits Godwin said the sealed filling station would pay a fine before it will be reopened. He added that any filing station apprehended violating the law of the land would be compelled to sell all the available products in their custody to the general public. Engr. Godwin however stated that the agency is on the lookout for some erring marketers who are currently hoarding the product to cause scarcity in the state. According to him, any marketer found wanting will be severely penalized in accordance with the offence committed. His words, “These two filing stations will remain sealed until they pay money to the Federal Government account. We have been warning them to stop sharp practices but some won’t listen. “The Federal Government has not announced any increase in the price of fuel. I begin to wonder why they are using this artificial scarcity to exploit the masses. “Let this be a note of warning to other airing marketers who intend to engage in swindling the people for their own selfish interest. Any marketer caught selling above the approve pump price, hoarding or under dispensing will be sanctioned.”
