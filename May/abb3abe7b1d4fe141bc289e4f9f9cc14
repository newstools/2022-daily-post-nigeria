Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola has taken a swipe at Jurgen Klopp and his Liverpool side. City are now three points ahead of their Premier League title rivals after their 5-0 thrashing of Newcastle United on Sunday. Liverpool’s title hope was dealt a huge blow on Saturday after the Reds were held to a 1-1 draw by fourth-placed fighters, Tottenham. Guardiola said that everyone in England, including the media, supports Liverpool. With three games left to play, Pep Guardiola’s men are now heavy favourites to retain their crown. After the game on Sunday, Guardiola was asked how it feels to have re-taken control of the title race and the Spaniard chose to go off on a tangent about how much support he feels Liverpool have received in the title race. “Well one week ago, even when we were in front, nobody [was saying that],” he told beIN Sports. “Everyone in this country supports Liverpool, the media and everyone “Of course because Liverpool has an incredible history behind them, in European competitions. Not in the Premier League, because they’ve won one in 30 yearbooks. “But it’s not a problem at all. The situation is what it is.”
