A Kano State High Court has sentenced a 19-year-old man, Ibrahim Khalil, to death by hanging for killing his five-year-old nephew, Ahmad Ado. Justice Usman Naabba convicted Khalil of kidnapping and culpable homicide. According to Na’abba, the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and, as a result, sentenced the convict to 14 years imprisonment for kidnapping and death by hanging for homicide. Mr Lamido Sorondinki, the prosecution counsel, had earlier told the court that Khalil committed the offences sometime in 2019 at Karkasara Quarters in the Kano metropolis. He told the court that the defendant abducted his sister’s son, Ado, explaining that he used sellotape to cover his nostrils and mouth and buried him in a shallow grave at Sabuwar Sheka in Kano. The prosecution, therefore, presented three witnesses to the court and four exhibits. The prosecutor explained that the offences contravened sections 274 and 221 (a) of the Penal Code. The convict denied committing the offences. Aisha Abdulkadir, the defence counsel, presented the defendant as a lone witness and pleaded for clemency on behalf of her client.
