The Federal Capital Territory Police Command has arrested suspects linked to the murder of a late National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) member, Stephanie Se-ember Terungwa. DAILY POST recalls that the corps member who was declared missing after leaving home for her Community Development Service was later found dead with her body parts missing. Her body was found kitted in NYSC uniform, about two weeks after she disappeared in the Lokogoma area of the territory. The incident triggered reactions from concerned Nigerians and fear amongst corps members serving in the nation’s capital. A police source told DAILY POST on Tuesday that following the ongoing investigation to uncover the root cause of the corps member’s death, the husband, Terungwa Edward Achado and others are currently in police custody. According to the source, the husband and two others who last called the phone number of the victim were arrested on Saturday. He revealed that the suspects are with the homicide section of FCT Police Command as investigations continue. When DAILY POST contacted the FCT Police Command, the Public Relations Officer, DSP Josephine Adeh simply said “Investigation is ongoing”. Further asked to reveal the suspects arrested following the incident, she said “the command has assembled the best hands to unravel the mystery behind the death of the corps member”.
