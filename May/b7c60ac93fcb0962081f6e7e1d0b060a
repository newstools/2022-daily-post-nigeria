Chelsea forward, Timo Werner, has revealed the effect of Roman Abramovich sanctions on the club as American billionaire Todd Boehly takes charge of the West London club. Werner said Chelsea players were forced to save money after the UK government imposed sanctions on Abramovich. The Germany international explained what kind of changes he and his teammates experienced in their day-to-day after it was confirmed that Abramovich’s assets were frozen. Abramovich had announced his decision to sell Chelsea in March following the UK government sanction on the Blues. However, Boehly and his consortium are now on the verge of completing a £4.25 billion takeover after agreeing to a deal to buy Chelsea from Abramovich a few days ago. “For example, our bags and stuff had to be out of our rooms by 11 am when we had a Champions League game where before our bags could stay in the room for as long as we stayed in the room,” Werner told The Mirror. “It was little things which were a bit funny. Not things to worry about. “We felt we couldn’t come to the game with two buses anymore, we had to be a bit closer together, we had to save money at some points, which is different to what we were used to in the hotel and somewhere else. “Of course, we heard a lot in the press and the media. What’s going on, who is the new owner, what happens if we don’t find a new owner. “I think the club did a very good job to keep everything away from us as much as possible.”
