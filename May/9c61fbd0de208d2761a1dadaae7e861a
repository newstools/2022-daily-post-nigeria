Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has alleged that the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, sold properties belonging to the State, including gas turbines, Olympia hotel and transfered $50 million from the State’s account when he was governor in Rivers. The Governor, who spoke during a Thanksgiving service at St. Paul’s Anglican Cathedral in Port Harcourt on Sunday, alleged that an All Progressives Congress, APC, governorship aspirant in the State, Tonye Cole is a business partner of the Minister. He accused the former governor of plotting to bring his business partner to become governor of the State as a means of turning Rivers into his personal property. “You (Amaechi) think you can sell this State? The former governor thinks that he can bring his business partner, after you have sold all our gas turbines, Olympia hotel, collected our $50million cash. “He (Cole) must account for the $50 million they took from our account. Whoever knows him should tell him. $50 million was taken from Rivers State Access Bank account and transferred to Sahara Energy account. “And I asked them what is the job you people did for Rivers State? Can I see the contract paper, did you people loan us money?” He queried.
