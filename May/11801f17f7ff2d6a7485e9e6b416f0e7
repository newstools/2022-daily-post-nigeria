Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has confirmed that they have a preferred bidder, as the club looks to find a new owner. The Premier League side need to complete the takeover before next month’s deadline. Tuchel is confident that a deal will be struck soon. Todd Boehly’s consortium is believed to be preferred bidder status by the Raine Group, the New York bank overseeing Chelsea ’s sale. They had beaten a number of other bidders, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s last-minute bid now also expected to prove unsuccessful. “I’ve been told last week that we have a preferred bidder and things are going forward,” Tuchel said. “It’s a pretty important week for the club, but I was fully focused on the pitch. But after what I heard last week I’m confident.”
