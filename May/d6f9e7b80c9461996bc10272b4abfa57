Thibaut Courtois has warned Liverpool ahead of this weekend’s Champions League final, claiming that: “When Real Madrid play a final, they win it”. The LaLiga winners are seeking to lift a record-extending 14th title in Paris on Saturday night. For Courtois however, it will be the first time he wins the prestigious European Cup. The Belgian goalkeeper finished on the losing side in the 2014 final when Atletico Madrid were beaten by Real Madrid. Speaking at the pre-final press conference, Courtois said: “They’ve already played one final against Madrid in 2018. It was different for me. “Real Madrid, when they play a final, they win it, and so now I’m on the right side of history.”
