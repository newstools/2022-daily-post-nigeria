Garba Shehu, Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and publicity, has dismissed claims that his principal pays no attention to victims of attacks in Nigeria. Shehu spoke on Friday while responding to the debates generated following President Buhari’s condolence visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over the death of the country’s President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. “Those Nigerians should be told that they should look at all of the facts. I’ve accompanied the President to Sokoto on a condolence visit after a major incident,” Shehu said on Channels Television’s Politics Today. “However, it’s unfair also to make the conclusion wrongly that he hadn’t paid attention or hadn’t visited. He had been to Maiduguri quite a number of times.” He continued: “I accompanied him to Zamfara (State). He spoke to the governor, parliamentarians, religious and traditional leaders. “I accompanied the President to Benue State. He addressed the governor in the Government House, Makurdi, after a major incident. I accompanied him to Jos [Plateau State] after a crisis. “So, did the President go to all the places where there have been incidents of violence or killings? No, he didn’t go,” he added. Buhari is expected back to the country this weekend.
