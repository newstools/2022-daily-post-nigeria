Former England striker, Trevor Sinclair has revealed Real Madrid may come out sluggish and struggling in their Champions League final against Liverpool on Saturday, having rested for three weeks. Real Madrid, who have rested the majority of their first-team stars since after claiming their LaLiga title about three weeks ago, will clash with Liverpool, who just had a week of rest after narrowly losing the Premier League title to Manchester City on Sunday. Liverpool can become the joint-second most successful Champions League club in history alongside AC Milan with victory on Saturday night in Paris. A win for Real Madrid will give them their 14th Champions League trophy at Stade de France Sinclair told talkSPORT, “Sometimes when you’ve had a bit of a break, you can be lethargic and sluggish. “Other times, when it’s been a tough season, it can be a nice rest, especially if you’ve got a few injuries. “The experience the manager has got, he’ll keep them in tip-top condition. So it might work in Madrid’s favour.”
