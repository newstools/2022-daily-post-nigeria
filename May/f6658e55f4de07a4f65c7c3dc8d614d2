A gubernatorial aspirant in the Bauchi State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Dr Musa Babayo, has tasked the leadership of the party in the State to be fair, just and equitable to all aspirants. Babayo stated this on Saturday when he led his campaign team to the APC State secretariat to signify his interest to run for next year’s gubernatorial election on the platform of the party. According to him, providing a level playing ground for all aspirants would ensure the emergence of the best and acceptable candidates to fly the party’s flag in the general elections. While expressing confidence in the State executive members of the party, Babayo, who holds the traditional title of Talban Katagum, advised them to exhibit justice and fairness in the conduct of all party activities, including the party primary elections. “As a gubernatorial aspirant, I have every confidence in the leadership of the party in the State in whatever activity they might conduct for the benefit of members (of the party) and mankind. “So, offer the best of your ability for it is only the Almighty Allah who can judge you,” the governorship hopeful told the State executive members of the party. Speaking on his aspiration to take over the mantle of leadership in the State as its next governor, Dr Babayo said his sole objective was to pay Bauchi State back for what it had done for him, especially in sponsoring his education up to university level. Responding, the APC State chairman, Alhaji Babayo Aliyu Misau, assured all gubernatorial aspirants in the party that the executives would exhibit justice, fairness and equity. The chairman further assured that the party leadership would undertake their responsibilities to the best of their abilities in consonance with democratic norms.
