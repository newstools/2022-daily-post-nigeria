Chelsea will offer Mason Mount a huge pay rise once the Todd Boehly consortium complete their takeover of the club, SportMail reports. The 23-year-old has become a key member of both the Blues and England set ups. Mount scored 11 goals and provided 10 assists in the Premier League this season. The England midfielder was the only Chelsea player to reach double figures for either. Despite his impressive season, he remains one of the lowest paid players at the club with a weekly wage of £80,000. However, that is set to change if the planned takeover goes through, as the club will more than double if the club is bought successfully. They also claim Mount is happy to commit his long-term future to his boyhood club, as they look to build a team around him that can compete with Manchester City and Liverpool.
