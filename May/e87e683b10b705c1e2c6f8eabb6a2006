A governorship aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party in Rivers State, Farah Dagogo, has pleaded not guilty to two counts of felony and attempted disruption of screening exercise of PDP in the state, preferred against him by Rivers state government. In the charges read before the court, Dagogo and others who are now at large are alleged to have on the 27th of April, 2022 invaded PDP party secretariat on Aba Road Port Harcourt with firearms causing panic with intent to disrupt screening exercise of the party. When the charges were read out, the accused who was brought to court on a wheelchair, pleaded not guilty and his Counsel informed the court of his bail application. The counsel cited sections of the Rivers State law, which authorized the court to grant bail to his client after withdrawing a motion for preliminary objection on the jurisdiction of the court. But prosecution counsel, Zacchaeus Adango, who is Attorney General of the state, in his response, objected to the application saying the bail application cannot be tendered in the court before plea. He argued further that there are other pending motions for preliminary objection of jurisdiction of the court to hear the matter and therefore asked the court to dismiss the bail application. Trial Judge, Justice Chinwendu Nworgu before adjourning till 20th of May, 2022 for consideration of bail application and possible commencement of trial, directed that Dagogo should be taken back to hospital where he is receiving medical attention.
