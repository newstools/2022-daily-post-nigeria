Akwa Ibom State First Lady, Martha Emmanuel, has advised women, especially victims of gender-based violence to consider stepping aside from abusive relationships rather than exposing themselves to life-threatening risks. Speaking during the inauguration of a Sexual and Gender-Based Referral Center for Uyo Senatorial District on Thursday, Emmanuel, who is also the chairperson of the State Gender-Based Violence Management Committee, urged victims to always report abusive cases to law enforcement agents, saying her committee will not spare resources in bringing perpetrators to book. She said, “Victims of abusive relationships should consider the option of stepping aside than expose themselves to life-threatening risks. “I encourage all victims of sexual and gender-based assaults in the state to report to the law enforcement agents, our Committee is ever ready to swing into action once notified.”
