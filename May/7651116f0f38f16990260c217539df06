Some disgruntled members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Sunday took their protest to the Osun State Government House, GRA Oke-Fia, Osogbo. The protesters were demanding that Abosede Ogo-Oluwa, an aspirant in the just concluded primary election for the Osogbo Federal Constituency that was held on Friday, should be declared the winner. The aggrieved members of the party, mostly women, called on the leadership of the party to as a matter of urgency announce their candidate whom they said is the winner of the primary election conducted on Friday. They condemned the continued delay in the announcement of the people’s choice. They wondered why the committee saddled with the responsibility of conducting the election would delay the announcement of the results and appealed to them to do the needful as the people of the federal constituency had waited enough. They explained that with evidence backed up with video clips and pictures of voters lining up for Abosede Ogo-Oluwa during the primary elections in designated wards, there was no doubt that Abosede Ogo-Oluwa remained the winner of the primary election. The protesters called on party leaders and other stakeholders to let the people’s votes count by announcing the winner, Abosede Ogo-Oluwa to avoid any confusion.
