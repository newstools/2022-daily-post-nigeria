There was pandemonium in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, on Saturday as over 20 persons scrambling for free food and gifts in a new generation church reportedly died in a stampede. The Nation reports that the church had invited members of the public for its fourth edition of free gifts and food items distribution at the church premises. DAILY POST gathered that the incident occurred in the early hours of Saturday when a crowd of persons stormed the gate of the church and pushed it causing scrambling that led to the stampede. Details of the incident are still sketchy as of press time, however, it was learnt that scores of victims who sustained injuries have also been rushed to hospital. When contacted by DAILY POST, the state’s Police Public Relations Officer, Iringe Grace Koko, pledged to revert with details. She said, “we are currently there now. You will hear from us shortly”.
