The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has disclosed why its operatives invaded the residence of Imo West Senator, Rochas Okorocha. EFCC’s spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, disclosed that operatives of the anti-graft agency were in Okorocha’s house to arrest him. Uwujaren explained that the move followed the All Progressives Congress, APC, Presidential aspirant’s failure to honour EFCC’s invitations. He noted that the former Imo State Governor jumped administrative bail the commission granted him and had refused to honour invitations. A statement by Uwujaren reads: “Operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, today May 24, 2022, arrived at the Maitama, Abuja home of a former governor of Imo state, Senator Rochas Okorocha, to effect his arrest. “The move followed the refusal of the former governor to honour invitations after jumping the administrative bail earlier granted him by the Commission. “In the circumstances, the Commission is left with no option than to effect the arrest of Senator Okorocha and bring him to trial.” On January 24, 2022, the commission had dragged the lawmaker before an Abuja Federal High Court for alleged diversion of public properties worth N2.9 billion. EFCC had filed a 17-count criminal charge against the former Imo State Governor. The case was assigned to Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja. However, attempts to arraign the APC Presidential aspirant stalled twice due to his absence. EFCC claimed that Okorocha evaded being served court processes twice. At the last adjourned date, March 28th, 2022, Justice Ekwo before adjourning until May 30th, 2022, had warned that it was “the last adjournment I shall grant in this matter”.
