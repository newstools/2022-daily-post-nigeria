Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has said Thiago Alcantara has “a good chance” of being fit for their Champions League final with Real Madrid. Thiago suffered an Achilles injury in their final Premier League fixture against Wolves on Sunday. But Klopp has confirmed the 31-year-old will resume training on Thursday, in what will be a huge boost to the Reds. Asked at a media conference about the midfielder’s fitness, Klopp told reporters: “I only just met him now inside. There’s a good chance. “He will be training this afternoon. He did some stuff this morning. It was not planned that he was doing this session with the players this morning, but it looks like he can be part of [team] training tomorrow. That would be really helpful! “We hope he can. It is surprisingly good. After the [Wolves] game I was not really positive about it, but then we got that news overnight that it was not bad. “So we will see. I can imagine everybody thinks now it is three days before the game and he is not training, but we just have to be sure that we do the right stuff in the right moment.”
