Departing Manchester United striker, Edinson Cavani, was seen swearing at fans as he got onto the team bus, following their 1-0 defeat at Crystal Palace. The Red Devils finished their worst season ever in the topflight with a loss at Selhurst Park. Wilfried Zaha netted the only goal as United recorded their 12th league defeat. Cavani was clearly unhappy as he walked towards the bus, and he reacted to some fans taunting him by sticking his middle finger up at them. When the Uruguay striker got onto the bus, he turned back again towards the crowd and repeated the action. It is unclear if the supporters were Palace or United fans. The 35-year-old is expected to leave Old Trafford this summer.
