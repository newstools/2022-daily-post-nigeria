The deputy gubernatorial candidate of Accord Party in the 2022 Osun gubernatorial election, Kunle Jimoh has revealed that seven other political parties have indicated interest in forming a broad-based coalition with Accord Party. He said this would further help its push to snatch victory from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Jimoh was, however, silent on the names of the said political parties. He also assured the Osun electorates that the Accord Party will come out victorious in the July 16 gubernatorial election in the State. Jimoh, who is the running mate to Akin Ogunbiyi, the Osun Accord Party gubernatorial candidate, disclosed this on a radio political programme in Osogbo on Saturday. He stated that there was a possibility of other political parties joining forces with them, adding that with a determined force, victory will be achievable and the State will be liberated. He promised that with the Accord Party coming, all local governments in the State would be granted total autonomy to deliver dividends of democracy. “Also our agenda is that the State pensioners will receive their entitlement as at when due under the Accord party government,” he said.
