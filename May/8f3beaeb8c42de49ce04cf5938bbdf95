Former Arsenal midfielder, Emmanuel Petit, has urged the club to sign ‘big names’ like Crystal Palace’s Wilfried Zaha, Newcastle’s Allan Saint-Maximin and Manchester City duo, Gabriel Jesus and Raheem Sterling this summer. Petit said Arsenal needs these players to help their manager Mikel Arteta source alternatives in the Gunners’ attack to boost their squad depth next season. “I have heard big names as well, Jesus, Sterling, I really like Zaha, or even someone like Saint-Maximin from Newcastle,” Petit was quoted by Sportskeeda as saying. “Martinelli is a very good player, just like Saka, but when they get injured, who’s going to play on the left and right? There are no options, they need at least four players, at least two upfront.” Arsenal are currently engaged in a tight Premier League race for the top four with Tottenham. Arteta’s side fell to a harrowing 3-0 defeat away to Tottenham in their last game.
