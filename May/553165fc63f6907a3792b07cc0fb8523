The All Progressives Congress, APC, in Gwaram Local Government Area has suspended two-party executives for allegedly disobeying the party’s directives. Chairman of the party in Gwaram, Ayuba Umar Nasarawa, stated this after a meeting with the party’s executives. He said those suspended include Gambo Umar Bango, APC youth leader of Gwaram Local Government Area and Salisu Garba, APC chairman of Dingaya ward. He explained that the party had set up a committee to investigate the alleged misconduct and violation of the party’s guidelines. Nasarawa noted that the affected executives will remain suspended until after the outcome of the committee. He said the party will not tolerate any act of indiscipline and disloyalty to the party leadership. This is coming days after the Jigawa State House of Assembly had indefinitely suspended the Chairman of Yankwashi Local Government over alleged disloyalty to the state chairman of the party. However, a few hours after, the Jigawa State Governor, Muhammad Badaru Abubakar, had ordered for the immediate reinstatement of the suspended council chairman Mubarak Ahmed Achilafiya.
