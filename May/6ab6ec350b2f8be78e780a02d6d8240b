The Emir of Kagara, Ahmed Garba Attahiru II, in Niger State has called on his subjects and well-meaning citizens of the state to continue to pray for the total return of peace to the emirate, following incessant attacks by bandits in the past few years. Making the call in Kagara, headquarters of Rafi local government area, the royal father said the emirate has suffered a series of torments from bandits for some couple of years. He explained that his people are desirous of peace as, without it, there can be no meaningful development while commending the state government for the gradual return of peace to the area. The monarch stated,” efforts of our government and security agencies are highly commendable in curbing insurgency in the emirate and other parts of the state. We are happy that we are relieved of the incessant attacks by the bandits and we should continue to pray for this peace to continue going forward.” However, Attahiru II urged politicians in the state to shun rancour during the electioneering campaign as well as avoid politics of bitterness in order not to heat the polity. The Emir also advised youth who have reached 18 years of age to obtain their voter cards to enable them exercise their civic rights of electing credible leaders in the forthcoming general elections.
