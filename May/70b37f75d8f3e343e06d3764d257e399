Former Monaco star, Victor Ikpeba has named the club that will join Watford and Norwich City in relegation this season. The battle for Premier League survival resumes this weekend, with three teams, Everton, Leeds United and Burnley, fighting to avoid relegation from the top flight as Watford and Norwich have since been relegated. Everton are two points ahead of 18th-placed Leeds United, who have the same number of points as 17th-placed Burnley but have played a game more than the Clarets. But Ikpeba believes Leeds United will be returning to the Championship at the end of the season. Speaking on SuperSports’s Monday Night Football, Ikpeba said: “Looking at Burnley and Leeds United, Burnley will have to be very careful. Leeds just needs to beat Brighton & Brentford.” “Any of the two teams that pick six points will escape relegation. Burnley cannot beat Spurs, who are fighting for a Champions League position. “Leeds United will join Watford and Norwich as the relegated teams,” he said.
