President Muhammadu Buhari has appointed Mr. Anamekwe Chukwunyere Nwabuoku to oversee the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation. Nwabuoku is to take over the position pending the outcome of the EFCC investigation of the suspended AGF, Ahmad Idris. Buhari’s former aide, Bashir Ahmed confirmed the development on Sunday. DAILY POST had reported that Idris was last week suspended by the Minister of Finance, budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed. His suspension came after the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, arrested him for allegedly diverting funds and laundering N80billion. He wrote on Twitter, “Mr. Anamekwe Chukwunyere Nwabuoku has been appointed to oversee the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation, pending the outcome of the EFCC investigation of the suspended AGF, Ahmad Idris.”
