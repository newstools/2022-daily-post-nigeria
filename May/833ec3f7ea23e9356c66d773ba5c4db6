Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi, has shared his conversation with President Muhammadu Buhari regarding Biafra agitator, Nnamdi Kanu. The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) leader faces treason charges filed by the Federal Government of Nigeria. Umahi told State House correspondents in Abuja on Tuesday that a political solution could resolve the matter. The governor said it was left for South-East leaders to ensure that the out-of-court settlement option works. “The President repeatedly said the matter is in court, we must appreciate his pedigree and integrity. “He cannot just as a President say he is going to destroy the matter in court. “He said, ‘Your cultural leadership should be able to initiate that with Nnamdi Kanu’s lawyer’. “This is over six months and we have been begging the President of Ohaneze to take up that responsibility.” Umahi recalled meeting the Attorney-General of the Federation, Department of State Services (DSS) Director-General and the Inspector General of Police. The Ebonyi helmsman confirmed they are all disposed to negotiation, adding that “the ball is in our hand”.
