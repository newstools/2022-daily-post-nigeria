Governor Chukwuma Soludo of Anambra State has called for the immediate and unconditional release of Mr. Okechukwu Okoye, a member representing Aguata 2 in the House of Assembly and his campaign director. Gunmen kidnapped Okoye and his campaign director, Mr Cyril Chiegboka, on Sunday. In a statement issued on Monday by Christian Aburime, his Chief Press Secretary, Soludo condemned the abduction and increasing wave of insecurity in the State. He said, “The Governor condemns the spate of insecurity across the State in recent times where innocent citizens have been attacked or killed. “This is happening at a period when the government is already reaching out to critical stakeholders for the restoration of peace and security to the State.’’ Soludo condemned the spike in the kidnapping and killing of innocent citizens and the undermining of the sanctity of lives in the State. According to him, no one or group had the right to take human life with impunity. He expressed his heartfelt condolences and sympathy to families of those who had lost their loved ones and property directly or indirectly. “My government is doing everything possible in collaboration with security agencies to restore peace and security to the State in accordance with the law,’’ Soludo was quoted as saying.
