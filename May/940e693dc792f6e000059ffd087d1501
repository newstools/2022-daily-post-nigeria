Godday Samuel Adagboyi, the lawmaker representing Apa/Agatu Federal Constituency at the National Assembly, has lost his return bid ticket. Adagboyi, who contested for the APC ticket in the just-concluded primaries of the party in Benue State, lost to business mogul, Adama Joseph Adama, popularly known as Otalaka. Adagboyi’s defeat brings the number of serving lawmakers who lost their return bid tickets in Benue to four. Among those who earlier lost at the primaries of the party were Mr. Mark Gbillah representing Gwer East/Gwer West Federal Constituency, Francis Agbo representing Ado/Okpokwu/Ogbadibo Federal Constituency and Kpam Sokpo of Buruku Federal Constituency, all of the Peoples Democratic Party. Announcing the result on Saturday, the Electoral Committee led by Samuel Shagbaor (Chairman) and Franklin Shankodi (Secretary), said Adama polled 21,747 votes to beat the incumbent, Godday Samuel Odagboyi, who scored 3,151 votes in the direct mode primaries. Godday won the Apa/Agatu Federal Constituency seat on the platform of Labour Party in 2019, but later defected to the APC in June 2021.
