The leadership of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, in Cross River State has proactively forestalled likely bloodbath that may ensue if they went ahead to conduct party’s primaries for the Boki/Ikom Federal Constituency seat. They have, therefore, summoned caucus members to an emergency meeting tonight at Senator Victor Ndoma-Egba’s house in Calabar to arrive at a consensus candidate. In a statement signed by the Publicity Secretary of the party, Erasmus Ekpang, it explained that they want to prevent what happened when two policemen were shot dead during Obudu/Bekwara/Obanliku PDP primaries two days ago. The statement said, “I have the directives of the State Chairman of the APC, Barr. Alphonsus Ogar Eba to invite all caucus members and aspirants of Boki/Ikom Federal Constituency for a meeting today, Wednesday 25/05/2022, by 8:00pm under the chairmanship of Distinguished Senator Victor Ndoma-Egba SAN. “This meeting has become necessary to arrive at a consensus candidate and to forestall any bloodbath as was experienced in Obudu/Bekwarra/Obanliku Federal Constituency primaries of the opposition party.” The statement emphasised that it was mandatory for all aspirants for the House of Reps. The party caucus members to attend are those strictly permitted by the party’s constitution.
