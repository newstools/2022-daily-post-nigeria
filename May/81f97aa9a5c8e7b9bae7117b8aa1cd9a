Death toll from the collapsed three-storey building at Ebute Metta, Lagos, as of Monday morning, has risen to five, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) officials say. Recall that an old three-storey building collapsed at No. 24 Ibadan Street, Herbert Macaulay Way, Ebute Meta, on Sunday night, at about 10.56 p.m. The Lagos State Fire and Rescue Service disclosed this late Sunday on its Twitter handle. The service assured that rescue operations have begun to save anyone trapped in the building. However, the Zonal Coordinator Southwest, NEMA, Mr Ibrahim Farinloye, told NAN in Lagos that the deceased persons included three males and two females. The number of rescued occupants remained at 23. Rescue operations are ongoing at the site of the incident in search of four of the remaining occupants of the building.
