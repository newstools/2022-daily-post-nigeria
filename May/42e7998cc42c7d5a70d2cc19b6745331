Gunmen suspected to be bandits on Friday reportedly stormed Kurmin Sata community, a few kilometres from Millennium City, a suburb of Kaduna metropolis and kidnapped 20 residents and killed one. Mallam Nasir Umaru, whose relatives were among those kidnapped, told DAILY POST in Kaduna that the bandits stormed the area around 11 pm on Friday when residents were sleeping. “Immediately they raided our community, they started shooting sporadically while moving from house to house, abducting the villagers,” he said. He said after they left, the villagers made a headcount and discovered that 20 residents, including a visitor who came to pass the night in his fiancee’s house, were taken away. Another resident said, “Yes, the visitor and his heartthrob were kidnapped. Also kidnapped were women and children who were taken to an unknown destination.” The head of the Joint Security Task, who pleaded for anonymity, said seven of the kidnapped victims have escaped and have returned to their respective homes. He also said that the village head of the community and some traditional title holders were among the kidnapped victims. “One of the villagers died from a stray bullet that hit him on his chest,” he said. The spokesman for the state police command, ASP Muhammad Jalige, did not pick up his call when our reporter called him for comments.
