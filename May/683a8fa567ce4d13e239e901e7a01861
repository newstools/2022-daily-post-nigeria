Despite failing to clinch the party’s ticket to represent Ondo Central Senatorial District, Clement Faboyede, the former Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ondo State, has stated that he will not abandon the party. Faboyede claimed that as a core party member, he will never desert the party, especially after he gave his all to the party while the PDP was struggling in the state. The former PDP Chairman, who emerged in third place in the party’s senatorial primaries, stated that the process was free and fair. Faboyede lost the PDP primary to Adedipe Ifedayo, SAN, who scored 82 votes. He disputed viral allegations insulting former Governor Olusegun Mimiko and other PDP leaders over the outcome of the party primaries while speaking to journalists in Akure. He went on to say that he accepted the primary results and was ready to work with Ifedayo to win the general election. “The truth is the primary was free and fair. The atmosphere was pleasant, free of hostility, and all processes were followed. That primary result is acceptable to me. “I want to be clear that I stand without malice, and I have never invited anyone to start throwing aspersions and nasty language on my leader, Dr Rahman Olusegun Mimiko, on Facebook or WhatsApp,” he said. “I’d like to be clear that I have no grudges against anyone. If PDP chooses anyone tomorrow, I will still perform and Ifedore will continue to deliver. “I’m a PDP person who believes in the party. I was the state chairman of the Democratic Party when it was in shambles. When I was released from prison as a result of APC victimization, Eyitayo Jegede SAN helped me re-establish the party.”
