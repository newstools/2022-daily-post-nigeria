A minor (name withheld) on Tuesday narrated her defilement to the Ikeja Domestic Violence and Sexual Offences Court in Lagos State. The 14-year-old recounted how her father’s neighbour, Rafiu Sanusi allegedly raped her five time in his room. The victim was 12-year-old at the time Sanusi allegedly had sex with for the first time, NAN reports. Sanusi, also known as “Baba Aliyah” and “Baba Maruwa”, is facing a charge of defilement. Led in evidence by Lagos Director of Public Prosecutions, Babatunde Martin, the girl recalled she was abused every time she visited her dad at Amukoko. “He used to call me inside his room and would ask me to remove my clothe and have sex with me. “He had sex with me five times but I did not report to anyone because the defendant threatened that I will die if I tell.” The victim told the court that one Ibrahim eventually caught Sanusi violating her through the window and informed the father. The girl disclosed that she was taken to the police station where officers directed the family to a hospital for checks. Under cross-examination by defence counsel, Idowu Adekoya, the JSS 3 student said her father, a butcher, works between 9.00 a.m. and 10 p.m. A forensic expert with Mirabel Medical Centre in Ikeja, Dr. Oyedeji Alagbe, confirmed that the test carried out on the girl showed a forceful penetration into her vagina. Justice Ramon Oshodi adjourned the case until June 27. Sanusi is expected to take the stand.
