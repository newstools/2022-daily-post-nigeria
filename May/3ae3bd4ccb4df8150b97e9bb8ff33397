Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has said that Manchester United and Liverpool are the most important clubs in the history of the Premier League. The Man City boss said this while insisting that he believes that the whole of England wants Liverpool to beat his side to the Premier League title this season. “Liverpool alongside [Manchester] United are the most important teams in history in terms of titles, legacies, history, dramas, for many, many things,” Guardiola told beIN Sport. The former Barcelona boss, however, said that Manchester City have been able to climb the top of the ladder in the English Premier League and that his side’s position in the last 10,11,12 years has made some people uncomfortable, adding “but I don’t care.” Guardiola said that even as it seems that Liverpool have more supporters and many people want them to win more than City, the Cityzens have more supporters all around the world than the Reds “But this is not the question, the question is: today, before the start of the game, the people cheering and supporting us more than ever in a home game because they know, even being out of the Champions League, we can rely on these players. “The support was amazing and hopefully we can arrive in the last game here with the chance to be champions,” he said.
