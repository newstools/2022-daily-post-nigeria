Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode has warned political parties against a Muslim-Muslim ticket in 2023. Fani-Kayode warned that Muslim-Muslim ticket in 2023 is reckless and dangerous. In a series of tweets, the All Progressives Congress, APC, chieftain also cautioned the Northwest, Southwest, and South-south against vying for the Presidency. He said the Igbos should be allowed to produce Nigeria’s next President in 2023. According to Fani-Kayode: “Is Nigeria made up of only the NW, SW & SS? Are the others not human beings too? “The Southerner who has betrayed the South is the one that says the Igbo must not produce the next President and that it must come to the SW or SS and not the one that supports a Northern candidate. “Worse is that one of those presidential aspirants from the South is toying with the idea of a Muslim/Muslim ticket! Can there be anything more reckless and dangerous than that? “And neither should anyone from the SW, SS or NW be talking about being President or Vice President in 2023. “The SE, NE and NC should have the right of first refusal for both. “Anything outside of that would be unjust and as they say, there can be no peace where there is no justice.”
