The Federal Government has amended the treasonable felony charges against Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB. Aloy Ejimakor, Kanu’s Special Counsel, said one of the seven-count charges was removed. Speaking with DAILY POST on Wednesday, Ejimakor said: “The Federal Government just amended the charges against Nnamdi Kanu now, they removed one, you know it was seven, but they removed one, and now it’s six. “We are in court waiting for the judge’s arrival, and Kanu himself is yet to arrive.” Trial Justice Binta Nyako had, on April 8, struck out eight out of the 15-count treasonable felony charge FG preferred against Kanu. A few weeks ago, Justice Binta Nyako of an Abuja Federal High Court had struck out eight of the 15 count charges against Kanu. Justice Nyako struck out counts 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12,13 and 14 of the charges. She, however, allowed counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 15. The IPOB leader would appear before Justice Nyako today for a hearing regarding his bail application.
