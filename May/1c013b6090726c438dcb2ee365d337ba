The Deputy Governor of Oyo State, Engineer Rauf Aderemi Olaniyan, has declared that God is the only one that will determine his next political office. Olaniyan made this disclosure while addressing journalists at his Ibadan residence on Monday. Our correspondent gathered that there are rumours of plans to replace him with another person ahead of the 2023 elections. Olaniyan has, however, announced that only God will determine his next political office next year. While addressing the journalists who thronged his residence as part of activities to celebrate this year’s Eld-el-Fitri festival, Olaniyan insisted that God is the one that gives power to whom he wishes and takes the power from whomever he wishes. He said the fact that he was not with Governor Seyi Makinde, when the governor went to obtain the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) nomination form does not mean that Makinde would drop him as running mate in the 2023 governorship election, adding that there is no rift between him and Makinde. When the curious journalists asked the deputy governor if he will serve as the running mate to the governor for the second term, Olaniyan said that only God will determine his political career in 2023. He said that he is still a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). “Where exactly am I going in 2023? “I know that 90 per cent of you people that are here will have the same question and that is why some of you are here. “But, on that question, you will be disappointed with the answer. Where are we going in 2023? The answer is very simple, Idina siratalmastakim. (God is our guidance). “As of today, I am a bonafide member of PDP. Anything can happen between now and then, 24 hours is too long in politics. Anything can happen.”
