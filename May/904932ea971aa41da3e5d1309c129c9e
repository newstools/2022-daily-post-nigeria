President Muhammadu Buhari’s aide on new media, Lauretta Onochie, has mocked a former lawmaker representing Kogi West, Senator Dino Melaye, and Senator Shehu Sani, who represented Kaduna Central during the 8th National Assembly after the pair failed to secure the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Senatorial and Governorship tickets respectively. Melaye lost the PDP Kogi West Senatorial ticket to TeeJee Yusuf. Sani, meanwhile, lost the PDP run for governorship ticket to Isah Ashiru. The PDP primary election was conducted on Wednesday across the country. In a tweet via her Twitter on Thursday, Onochie said Melaye and Sani staying in retirement is good for Kogi and Kaduna States. “Staying In Retirement. Good for Kaduna State. Good for Kogi State. Good for Nigeria,” She tweeted alongside a picture of both politicians.
