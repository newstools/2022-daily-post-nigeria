Deputy Governor of Oyo State, Engineer Rauf Aderemi Olaniyan, has disclosed that no fewer than five political parties have approached him to contest the 2023 election on their respective platforms. Olaniyan, an indigene of Igboho, in Oorelope Local Government Area of the State made this disclosure while addressing some journalists in Ibadan, the State capital on Wednesday. Olaniyan was elected as running mate to Governor Seyi Makinde in 2019 on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). There are speculations that the deputy governor has perfected plans to dump the PDP so as to realise his next political ambition ahead of the 2023 elections. Our correspondent recalls that Olaniyan had while receiving journalists as part of activities for this year’s Eld-Fitri festival said that only God will determine his next political office in 2023. The deputy Governor has now explained that five political parties have approached him to contest the gubernatorial election on their respective platforms in 2023. Olaniyan, who insisted that he is still a member of the PDP as at the time he was addressing the journalists, added that four of the political parties are ready to offer him their governorship ticket to contest in 2023. He said he had not made a decision either to leave the PDP or to remain in the party. Olaniyan said, “About five parties are wooing me with their ticket. Four of them are wooing me with governorship ticket. “Why the speculation is always coming up is because I have decided to stay aloof, all through the nominations and so, I haven’t bought any nomination form and I didn’t participate in it.
