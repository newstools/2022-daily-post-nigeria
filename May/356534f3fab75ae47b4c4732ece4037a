Despite Kano Governor Umar Abdullahi Ganduje and the All Progressive Congress, APC, stakeholders’ anointing of the State Deputy Governor as the governor’s successor, the party would still go for primary elections. Speaking to DAILY POST on the sudden move by one of the contenders, Barrister Inuwa Waya to insist on obtaining the party’s form, the Secretary of the Party, Zakari Sarina said they have no option but to go for primary election. He said, “it is true that almost all the stakeholders present during a meeting at the Government House endorsed the Deputy Governor as the party flag-bearer; however, that does not in any way stop anybody from testing his popularity through the primary”. Sarina added that, “in the case of Barrister Inuwa Waya, he met with Governor Ganduje and pleaded with him to allow him test his popularity and the Governor gave him a go ahead, and that is the beauty of democracy”. Waya, one of the strong gubernatorial contenders in Kano, had said he would still obtain his form. With this position, there is likelihood that other contenders like Senator Barau Jibrin, and A.A. Zaura may also obtain the party’s nomination form.
