A Magistrate Court sitting in Sokoto has remanded two suspects arrested over the murder of a 200-level student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Deborah Samuel, for alleged blasphemy. The Police arraigned the two suspects, Bilyaminu Aliyu and Aminu Hukunchi, who are also students of the college, on Monday. The Police First Information Report said both suspects were arraigned as a result of the mob action, which led to Deborah’s lynching. Both suspects pleaded not guilty to the charges levelled against them following their arraignment. Against this backdrop, the prosecutor, Inspector Khalil Musa, prayed the court for another date to enable the Police to complete its investigation. However, the defence counsels, led by Professor Mansur Ibrahim, who did not oppose the application, pleaded with the court to grant the defendants bail. Ibrahim cited sections 157, 161(a,f) and 164 of the administration of criminal justice law of Sokoto state, as well as 36(5) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended. The court, however, adjourned ruling on the application to a later date which would be communicated to the lawyers. It, therefore, directed that the defendants be remanded at the Sokoto Correctional Centre.
