Ukraine President, Volodymyr Zelensky, has declared that his country will never forget what its ancestors did in World War II amid the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Zelensky said Ukraine would win in the ongoing conflict against Russia because they are fighting for their children’s freedom. He said this in a video message he released as Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered his Victory Day speech in Moscow on Monday, according to CNN. “We are fighting for our children’s freedom, and therefore we will win,” Zelensky said. “We will never forget what our ancestors did in World War II, which killed more than eight million Ukrainians. “Very soon, there will be two Victory Days in Ukraine. And someone won’t have any. “We won then. We will win now. Happy Victory over Nazism Day!” Recall that Ukraine and Russia have been fighting for over two months. Several casualties have already been recorded as a result of the war. Putin had ordered the invasion of Ukraine because of some political differences between both neighbouring countries.
