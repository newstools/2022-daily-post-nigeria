Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp has given reasons why his side’s winning the quadruple will not happen this season. The German mentioned the fact that Tottenham’s Hary Kane and Heung-min Son were well-rested before the game against Liverpool helped Spurs record the all-important draw. Liverpool dropped a point against Antonio Conte’s Spurs on Saturday, playing out a 1-1 draw at Anfield and Klopp believes their hope to win the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup and Carabao Cup in one season might be over. Son gave Spurs the lead on Merseyside and while Luis Diaz pulled one back with a deflected strike 15 minutes from full-time. A 1-1 draw was enough to see Liverpool go to the top of the Premier League table on goal difference. But Manchester City will have the chance to open a three points lead over Liverpool if they beat Newcastle United on Sunday. “I’m not happy, but not as sad as the players are right now and it is my job to explain why something happens like this,” Klopp told BBC Sport. “Harry Kane and Heung-min Son were completely rested, that is why it is so hard. “That is why the quadruple is so unlikely, there is a reason nobody has done it in this country. We will keep going.” He added: “I would love to sit here and say City will drop points but I can’t see it.”
