Barcelona president, Joan Laporta, has said Neymar and Lionel Messi can only return to the club from Paris Saint-Germain as free agents. According to Laporta, it would make “no sense” to pay money for players that both previously played for the club. “Who doesn’t like Ney? He is an exceptional player, but he has [three] years on his contract with PSG. He is effectively enslaved to money. “The only way he could come back to Barca is for free. It would be irrational to pay a transfer fee for a player you have already had. “Leo left how he left. We would all have liked him to end his sporting career here, but because of [LaLiga’s] fair play rules and because of PSG’s offer, it was not to be. “If he wants to return one day, it would have to be for free. And the technical staff would have to decide if he fits the new project or not” Laporta told L’Esportiu.
