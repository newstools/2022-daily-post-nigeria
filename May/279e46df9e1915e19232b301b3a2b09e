An Ogun State House of Assembly aspirant in Imeko/Afon State Constituency, Hon. Sanusi Muisdeen, has rejected the outcome of yesterday’s primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC). DAILY POST reports that the primary election held within the premises of the Imeko/Afon Local Government Secretariat was won with 47 votes by the current lawmaker representing the constituency, Jemili Akingbade, who is seeking a third term. Akingbade was said to have defeated other aspirants like Muisdeen, known as Mese, Kunle Adisa, Idowu Matthew Idoma, James Oguntoke, and Hon. Aseroko, all of whom scored no vote in the primary. But Muisdeen lamented that “the election was a sham organised in favour of the sitting lawmaker.” According to him, supporters of the lawmaker did not allow other aspirants to participate in the election. He said Akingbade’s loyalists barred all the delegates of other aspirants from voting for candidates of their choice. He called on the APC National Working Committee (NWC) to address the issue, saying “the choice of Akingbade as the candidate of the party will not be accepted by the people of Imeko/Afon after a fruitless eight years in office.” “We went for the election but the delegates were not allowed to vote for the candidates of their choice. This is why I called on the State Working Committee( SWC) and the National Working Committee (NWC) of our great party APC to cancel the purported primary and conduct another free and fair one that will allow delegates to vote for their choice of candidates; only that can strengthen the party and prevent it from losing the assembly seat in our constituency,” he added.
