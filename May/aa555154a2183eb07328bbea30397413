The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arrested Nigeria’s Accountant General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris. EFCC Head of Media, Wilson Uwujaren announced this in a statement on Monday. The spokesman said EFCC operatives took Idris into custody for alleged massive fraud. The top official is accused of diversion of funds and money laundering to the tune of N80billion. Uwujaren noted that the commission acted on verified intelligence against Idris. He is said to have “raked off the funds through bogus consultancies and other illegal activities using proxies, family members and close associates”. The funds were laundered through real estate investments in Kano and Abuja, the EFCC added. Idris was nabbed after failing to honour invitations to respond to issues connected to the alleged fraudulent acts.
