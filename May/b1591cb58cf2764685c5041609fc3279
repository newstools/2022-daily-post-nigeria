A legal practitioner, Festus Ogun, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to sack Godwin Emefiele as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor. Emefiele, who is in his second term as the apex bank boss, has joined the 2023 presidential race. The CBN governor obtained the All Progressives Congress (APC) nomination and expression of interest forms which cost N100million. In a statement on Friday, Ogun said the action was illegal, morally reprehensible and weakens whatever is left of Nigerian institutions. The lawyer buttressed his call for Emefiele’s sack with Section 9 of the CBN Act, 2007. It states: “The governor and deputy governors shall devote the whole of their time to the service of the bank, and while holding office, shall not engage in any full or part-time employment or vocation, whether remunerated or not.” Ogun noted that politics is a vocation and Emefiele is not allowed by law to engage in partisan politics. He said despite “embarrassing failures”, Emefiele disregarded law and morality to vie for President under the ruling APC. “Our national vault is no longer safe. Mr. Godwin Emefelie must immediately resign his position as CBN Governor to save our country from this unthinkable absurdity. “The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) must immediately commence thorough investigation into Emefiele’s period in office. “I call on President Muhammadu Buhari to invoke his statutory powers under Section 11(2) of the CBN Act to sack Emefiele. “The National Assembly and civil society organizations are equally enjoined to intervene in this peculiar institutional desecration. All is not well”, the statement added.
