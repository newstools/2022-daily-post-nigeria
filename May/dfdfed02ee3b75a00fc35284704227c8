Former England goalkeeper, Paul Robinson feels Manchester United defender, Brandon Williams should move on because he will not get a starting place under incoming manager, Erik Ten Hag, next season. Williams joined Norwich City on loan at the start of the season. Following their relegation back to the Championship, the 21-year-old is set to return to Manchester after their final Premier League game on Sunday against Crystal Palace. Williams still has two years left on his contract with Man United. “Under [Erik] ten Hag, everyone will get a clean slate at Man United. Williams has never really been given a run of games at United but that could change. What he has to do is hit the ground running in pre-season.” “But, if I am honest, he is unlikely to even get a place on the bench next season. For that reason, I think it is more than likely that he will move on, whether that be on loan or on a permanent basis,” Robinson told Football Insider. Williams has featured regularly for Norwich, making 29 appearances.
