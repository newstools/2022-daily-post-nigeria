Contrary to rumours making the rounds, Delta State Governor, Arthur Ifeanyi Okowa today insisted he has not endorsed any governorship aspirants to succeed him as the 2023 elections draw near. The governor made the revelation at the just concluded quarterly media interaction held at the government house, Asaba. “If anybody tells you l have endorsed him as a sole candidate, I have not endorsed anybody. So, don’t mind those who are saying they have endorsed one person or the other as a sole candidate in the forthcoming PDP primary election.” He noted that many aspirants are in the governorship race with the rumours everywhere that he has endorsed some persons where he has not. He explained that it is the primary election which would be held soon that would determine the candidate that would fly the People’s Democratic Party’s, PDP flag. Gov. Okowa expressed the belief that whoever would take over from him as the next Governor of the State should be a person who will only initiate new projects to move the State to the next level but the person who can consolidate on the projects which he has done in the State. “All l pray and know is that the person to take over from me is the one who can consolidate on the projects which l have done in the State”. While pointing out that many projects including roads have been completed and many more are ongoing across the State, Okowa appealed to Deltans to protect government property saying whatever projects done in the state belong to all not ‘Okawa’ projects. He said it is wrong for people to see government property as Okawa’s and take pleasure in destroying them. “It is wrong for people to destroy government property, l think it is good for everyone to protect government’s property because they belong to all.” Gov. Okowa said it is not true of his critics to say that he has not done anything for the benefit of Deltans.
