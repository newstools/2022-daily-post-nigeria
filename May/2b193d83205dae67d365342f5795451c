Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State has accused President Muhammadu Buhari of excluding the South East. The Sokoto governor said people from the South-East feel cheated because Buhari keeps excluding them in the scheme of things, thereby heightening the insecurity in the region. Tambuwal said this while meeting with Imo State delegates under the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. He said; “Buhari has shortchanged the South-East. I was the one who advised Bukola Saraki to choose Ike Enweremadu to become his Deputy in 2015.” He said no head of the ten major parastatals in the country or Service Chiefs is from the Southeast which shows the level they have been excluded. “There’s a complete case of exclusion of the people of South East. The head of the ten most important parastatals are not from the South-East, including the CBN governor. “None of the service chiefs is from the South-East,” Tambuwal said.
