Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State has told the All Progressives Congress, APC, that there must be detailed reasons before he can accept a decision on a consensus candidate for the party. The Governor, who is among the crowd of APC’s presidential aspirants, insisted that there must be a cogent reason to back up such a decision, especially when he is not the favoured aspirant. Ayade told Channels Television on Tuesday that once he is convinced, he would accept the party’s decision and work with whoever gets the APC flag, describing himself as a team player. “In a scenario where the party creates very classical elucidations of the basis and selection criteria that I find completely adequate, I will have no objection,” the Governor said. “If they narrow down to somebody on the consensus basis and I don’t happen to be the one, I need to understand the selection criteria to explain how they arrived at Mr A and not B. If I feel that is a fair process, of course, I will yield to the supremacy of the party. “I am a team player and I don’t have any qualms with that. But I must see that it is fair and transparent. I know that capacity will be one of the key factors in consideration,” he added. Meanwhile, the APC on Tuesday said that former President Goodluck Jonathan was at liberty to join the fold if he so wished. The APC, speaking through its Bayelsa State Chairman, Dennis Otiotio, said the ex-President has yet to join the party. Otiotio disclosed this after the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders’ Association of Nigeria, MACBAN, purchased the ruling party’s nomination and expression of interest forms for Jonathan. DAILY POST understands that there’s growing confusion in the ruling party over moves by some politicians to draft Jonathan into the 2023 presidential race through the back door.
