Arsenal suffered a huge blow to their hopes of playing in the Champions League next season, following a 3-0 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur. The Gunners came into Thursday’s North London Derby four points ahead of their fierce rivals. A win would have seen Mikel Arteta’s men confirmed fourth place. However, they went behind to a Harry Kane penalty, before Rob Holding was sent off for two bookable offences. Kane completed his brace, while Heung-Min Son also got on the scoresheet. Tottenham will now take on Burnley on Sunday, before Arsenal travel to Newcastle on Monday night.
