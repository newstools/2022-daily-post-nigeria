Apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide has urged Ndigbo to utilize the opportunity of President Muhammadu Buhari’s visit to Ebonyi State. The advice was contained in a statement made available to DAILY POST, on Tuesday, by Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, the Secretary-General, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide. He spoke shortly after the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Elders’ Council meeting held in Abakaliki, on Tuesday, which was chaired by Prince Dr. Richard Ozobu. Isiguzoro said Ndigbo, at the meeting, agreed that President Buhari had been fair to Ndigbo in the area of infrastructural projects. He added that the Chairman of the South-East Governors’ Forum and Ebonyi State Governor, Engr Dave Umahi had made tremendous efforts towards getting the President’s attention to the zone, leading to the execution of several projects. On Buhari’s visit, the Ohanaeze scribe said “it is the best opportunity for Igbo leaders, together with the South-East Governors, to dialogue with President Buhari over the release of IPOB leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. “This window of opportunity must be fully utilized. We are upbeat that this will be one of the most remarkable visits of Mr. President to the South-East.” “We expect that the President’s two days working visit to Ebonyi State will change the narrative that Buhari hates Ndigbo, and he will prove it by kick-starting the process for the release of Nnamdi Kanu,” he added. Ohanaeze called on the IPOB and other pro-Biafra groups to “hold their peace and be part of the diplomatic moves towards the release of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.” “Buhari’s visit will also usher in fresh hopes of having a Nigerian President of Igbo extraction. “Having said that, we are welcoming President Buhari with an open mind and wish him a pleasant stay in Ebonyi State,” Isiguzoro declared.
