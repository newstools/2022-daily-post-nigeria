Rangers hero, Kenny Miller, believes Calvin Bassey has what it takes to thrive in the English Premier League. Bassey was voted Rangers’ Young Player of the Season in what has been an outstanding campaign domestically and in Europe. The versatile defender proved his mettle in Rangers’ UEFA Europa League defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt where he was unarguably the Gers best player of the game. The Nigerian international followed that up with another spirited display in Giovanni van Bronckhorst’s side Scottish Cup final win against Hearts on Saturday. The 22-year-old has been linked with a move to clubs in England, with Aston Villa, now managed by Steven Gerrard, the man, who brought him to Rangers said to be among the frontrunners for his signature. “For me, Bassey is now a £20million player. That’s what clubs are going to have to pay for him,” Kenny Miller wrote in his column in the Daily Record. “He can play in the English Premier League, there’s no doubt about that now. No one would disagree after watching his recent performances. “So can Rangers keep him? If they can’t, they need to make sure they get top dollar. Whether that’s £15m, £20m or £25m, they need to hold out for it –because he’s worth it. “His career is on such an upward trajectory at the moment that clubs will come calling.” Bassey was bought by Rangers from Leicester City two years ago. He has two years remaining on his contract with the Scottish Premiership outfit.
