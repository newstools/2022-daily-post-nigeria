An Upper Area Court in Jos on Friday issued a warrant for the arrest of a medical doctor, Michael Owoicho-Odeh. Maduabuchi Orji, a Jos-based businessman accused the former staff of the Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH) of an illicit affair with his wife. The Judge, Lawan Suleiman, gave the order when he was told that the defendant was again absent, NAN reports. Suleiman said the court cannot tolerate any form of disrespect “when a defendant deliberately refuses to show up and is constantly absent”. He upheld the argument by the prosecution counsel that the bail earlier granted the defendant be withdrawn. “I hereby order that a bench warrant be issued against the defendant and for him to appear before this court on the next adjourned date.” Muleng Alex, the Plateau Police Command Legal Officer had prayed the court to revoke the doctor’s bail. “The defendant and his surety have deliberately refused to show up for the continuation of the case. The court should not allow them to hold us to ransom”, she said. The defence counsel, Joseph Danboyi explained that his client was currently writing an examination. But the judge dismissed his objection and adjourned the case until June 13 for the continuation of hearing. The Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN) has suspended Owoicho-Odeh for six months for malpractice and infamous conduct. The five-member Medical and Dental Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal announced the sanction in Jos on March 23.
