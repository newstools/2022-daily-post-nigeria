The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State, on Sunday, held its primary elections to elect candidates for House of Representatives and State House of Assembly. DAILY POST gathered that the shadow elections were marred with crisis in some local governments, especially in Ogun Central and some parts of Ogun East. It was observed that there was a delay in the supply of voting materials, as the exercise did not start across the state until Sunday night. In Abeokuta South 1 & 2, Abeokuta North and Odeda, there were controversies over the list of delegates, a situation that almost disrupted voting in the constituencies. It was a similar scenario in some parts of Ijebu and Ado-Odo/Ota, our correspondent was told. However, the Publicity Secretary of the PDP in Ogun, Akinloye Bankole said the exercise recorded success across the State. He said the minor issues that took place in a few local government areas were not significant enough to rubbish the exercise. When DAILY POST contacted Bankole at 9:05 on Sunday night, the PDP spokesman said he was at his local government in Ipokia where voting was still ongoing. He confirmed that there were some disagreements, but the primaries were conducted, won and lost. “The primaries took place in Ogun State today (Sunday). In fact, we are still voting in Ipokia. The voting materials came late, but results are coming out already. “So far, good success has been recorded, except for some minor hiccups here and there; but those hiccups are not significant enough to rubbish the entire process,” Bankole explained.
