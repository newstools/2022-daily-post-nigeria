Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, Professor Yakubu Mahmood has debunked a report that he might purchase the N100 million presidential nomination and expression of interest form of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) A statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Rotimi Yekanmi said Yakubu remains an umpire committed to free, fair and credible elections. DAILY POST reports that the Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, had said that it would not be a shock should the Chairman of INEC buy the N100 million presidential nomination, following the decision of the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Godwin Emefiele But reacting, Yakubu said it is a preposterous proposition and will not happen. “Our attention has been drawn to innuendoes in certain quarters that Nigerians should not be surprised if the INEC Chairman joins the Presidential race or urges him to do so. It is a preposterous proposition. It will not happen. “The Chairman remains an umpire committed to free, fair and credible elections. “His constitutional responsibilities as the Chief Electoral Commissioner of the Federation and Returning Officer for the presidential election are onerous enough for him to even contemplate straying into extraneous matters at variance with the law, morality and his personal principles. “The Chairman will continue to discharge his responsibilities without affection for, or ill will against, any political party or candidate.”
