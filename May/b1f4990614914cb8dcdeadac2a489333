The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has concluded its National Assembly primary elections with the party failing to field aspirants for two senatorial seats in the three senatorial districts in the state. Speaking on the outcomes of the party primary elections, the National Secretary of the Congress Committee, Sani MB Ahmad, said the party had conducted peaceful elections although some House of Representatives also did not field aspirants for the election. Although Sani MB Ahmad, refused to reveal the two senatorial seats still vacant, reports have it that Kano, South and North are the ones having this problem. Similarly, some local governments did not have House of Representatives aspirants, something that created a serious vacuum in the primaries.
