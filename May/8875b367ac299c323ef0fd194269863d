Tottenham Hotspur head coach, Antonio Conte has warned his team against complacency as they prepare to face Arsenal on Thursday. The North London Derby could decide who qualifies for next season’s Champions League Spurs sit fifth on the log, four points behind the Gunners with three games left. Conte is hoping his team can get all three points on their home turf, which would take the battle to the wire. “I continue to tell my players to enjoy this moment, because to arrive at three games to go with an important target to play in the Champions League, it means that we are doing a good job, (but) the job has not finished. “And we have to try to get three points but the answer is it won’t be easy because we are talking about a really good team, a well organised team. I think he’s (Mikel Arteta) doing a really good job,” Conte told a news conference.
