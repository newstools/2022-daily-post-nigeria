Former Liverpool striker Dean Saunders, has said that Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah are entitled to demand higher wages given their performances for the club in recent years. Liverpool’s front three of Roberto Firmino, Mane and Salah remain very popular with the Anfield faithful. And Sounders believes Mane and Salah are the best players in the world and for this reason, deserve the best wages. The contracts of the two Africa Cup of Nations finalists, who have scored more than 275 goals for Liverpool between them, expire at the end of next season. And there are uncertainties over their futures at the club but Saunders believes they deserve the best. He told talkSPORT: “The two players we’re talking about, for me, are the two best players in the world right now. “Salah and Mane, it’s guaranteed that they’re going to get 25 goals a season. “The minute that someone gets £100k a week, whose not as good as Wayne[former Manchester United striker]Wayne [Rooney]would say ‘I need what he’s getting, I’m better than him’. “I think Salah and Mane are looking at Mbappe and thinking ‘well, what are you going to pay us?’”
