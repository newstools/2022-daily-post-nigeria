Yoruba socio-cultural organisation, Afenifere, has insisted that an Igboman should be given the opportunity to lead Nigeria come 2023. The group was only re-echoing the calls, which have been made by several groups and well-meaning individuals in the country for the presidential seat to be zoned to the South-East region. Afenifere said this call is based on morality as its leader, Ayo Adebanjo, maintained on Sunday that the region should produce the next president in the spirit of fairness and unity. “It is a question of principle. It is a question of morality. It’s a question of being inclusive in everything we do,” he said during an interview on Channels Television’s Sunday Politics. “If you want peace, you must have equity,” he added. The elder statesman explained further that since the South-West has had its turn with former President Olusegun Obasanjo and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, the South-South with ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, political parties should not hesitate to see the South East as the next in line. “Is South-East not in the south? Is it not in Nigeria?” the Afenifere leader asked, maintaining that the country had always given consideration to every part even during the pre-Independence days. “It is because of this inclusiveness we put federal character in the constitution,” he added.
