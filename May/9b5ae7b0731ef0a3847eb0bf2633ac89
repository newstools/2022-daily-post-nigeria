Liverpool legend, Graeme Souness, has picked out Chelsea’s strikers as their problem area under manager Thomas Tuchel this season. Souness said this after Chelsea lost 1-0 against Everton in a Premier League tie on Sunday. According to him, Chelsea’s strikers, such as Timo Werner, have just Premier League goals, adding that they have been confronted by an Everton team who have been very aggressive. Recall that Frank Lampard’s men defeated Chelsea at Goodison Park, thanks to Richarlison’s only goal of the match. “They are a team that don’t really have strikers they should have for the qualities in other departments of the team,” Souness said on Sky Sports. “For the money they have spent, they should have a lot more than what they have got, for me. “[Timo] Werner, four goals. They have been confronted here by an Everton team who have been very aggressive, they have matched that aggression.”
