However, a statement by its Deputy Director, Public Relations, Mr. Yakub Mahmoud, said the service will resume on Monday, May 23rd 2022. The resumption is coming two months after the train was bombed by terrorists. According to the statement, the service will return with greater security measures and without the early morning and the night train operations. The statement, however, assured the relatives of the abducted citizens still in captivity that the safe rescue of these passengers is a top priority and not to misconstrue the resumption of train services, as abandonment or nonchalant attitude of the government towards their plight. It said the federal government will never abdicate its responsibility in rescuing these valuable citizens, and assured of its resolve not to succumb to threats by any faceless group It further said additional security measures are being put in place at both the train stations and the track to ensure the safety of the passengers onboard. According to it the measures are not only for the Abuja-Kaduna Train Service (AKTS) but also for all the passenger train services especially on the standard gauge railway lines. “The passengers are enjoined to cooperate with the NRC in order to enjoin improved service delivery, safety and comfort by patiently complying with additional measures that will surely be introduced for the safety of our passengers, such as requesting for passengers National Identification Numbers (NIN) as part of our internal security check in addition, presentation of the following must be strictly complied with before boarding the train,” it said.
