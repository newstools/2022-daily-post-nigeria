Flying Eagles head coach, Ladan Bosso says his team will go all out for a win in Friday’s (today) final clash against neighbours, Benin Republic at the WAFU B U-20 Championship. Bosso’s team have already secured a place at the Africa U-20 Cup of Nations which will hold in Egypt next year, but are determined to finish the competition as champions. The Flying Eagles have no doubt surpassed expectations in this competition, taking into cognisance their lack of adequate preparation. The team spent less than three weeks in camp before travelling to Niamey, Niger Republic for the tournament. They started their sojourn with a comfortable 2-0 win against perennial rivals and defending champions, Black Satellites of Ghana. The Flying Eagles sealed top spot in Group B with a 2-2 draw against Young Stallions of Burkina Faso in their second game. The Nigerians survived a tensed semi-final clash, edging out Cote d’l voire 2-1 in extra-time to qualify for today’s final. A win against the Young Squirrels will cap an outstanding tournament for Bosso and his boys and the gaffer is upbeat they can achieve their objective. “We are happy to have the AFCON ticket under our belts now, but we want more. The Cup is now within reach and we will go all out for it,” Bosso said ahead of the final. “We want to be WAFU B champions. That will give us tremendous boost going into the African championship next year,” he said. The highly anticipated encounter will take place at the Stade General Seyni Kountché, Niamey.
