A 2023 governorship hopeful on the platform of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Abia State, Dr Alex Otti has tasked party faithful on peace and unity ahead of the upcoming general elections in 2023 in the State. This is coming on the heels of the current internal squabble in the Abia chapter of the APC, especially as activities leading to the general election in 2023 gather momentum. Otti, an ex-bank chief, in a statement by Ferdinand Ekeoma, his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, on Saturday, called on party leaders, stakeholders and teeming supporters at all levels in the State, to remain calm and confident, assuring that the challenges bedeviling the party currently would be resolved. The APC chieftain told them that in spite of the distractions from some quarters, key leaders and stakeholders of the party were intensifying efforts to ensure that peace and stability was restored, which he opined, was the panacea for victory in the upcoming 2023 general elections. He posited that since democracy is a game of numbers, no individual would be allowed to cause the destruction of the party through mischief and lawlessness, and predicted huge success for the APC in the 2023 election in Abia once popular and credible candidates are fielded. Otti pledged to liaise with other progressives and ensure that the majority of those who may have left the party out of anger and frustration returned in due course, under a united, peaceful and progressive APC family. “I want to further use this opportunity to call on those who have not obtained their Permanent Voters Cards to go and do so as quickly as possible in order to enable them vote for candidates of their choice at the appropriate time,” he advised.
