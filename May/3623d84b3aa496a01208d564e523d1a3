Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has hinted that Kepa Arrizabalaga will leave Stamford Bridge this summer. The German admitted the Spanish goalkeeper is ‘not happy’ with his role at the west London club and ‘deserves to play more’. Kepa became the most expensive goalkeeper in history when he moved from Athletic Bilbao to Chelsea on a stunning £72m deal in 2018. He lost his place in the team to 2020 after the signing of Edouard Mendy, who quickly established himself as one of the best goalkeepers in Europe. Asked about Arrizabalaga’s future during his last pre-match press conference of the season Tuchel said: “It depends what he wants and it depends what his plans are, but I know that we are very privileged to have Edou [Mendy] and Kepa in our squad. “I know for sure that Kepa is not happy about the situation and he deserves to play more and he can be a strong number one. “He arrived as a number one goalkeeper so the situation is not easy. I can tell you that he has been a fantastic team player since day one and always was and never let anybody down,” he added. Having admitted that the Spain International is unhappy at Stamford Bridge, Tuchel said he hopes to talk to the 23-year-old to find a way to convince to stay longer at the club. However, despite speculations linking the Spanish goalkeeper out of Stamford, Tuchel said he would like to have both strong goalkeepers, Mendy and Kepa at Chelsea next season, adding “Let’s see.”
