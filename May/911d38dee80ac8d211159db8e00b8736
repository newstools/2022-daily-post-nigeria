Former President Goodluck Jonathan has been cautioned against defecting to the All Progressives Congress, APC, ahead of the 2023 presidential election. Deji Adeyanju, an Abuja-based rights activist, said APC intends to embarrass Jonathan during its national convention in Abuja. In a tweet on Thursday, Adeyanju wrote: “What is Goodluck Jonathan really looking for again? These APC people are extremely dishonest; they might embarrass him at Eagle Square.” There are indications that Jonathan is working towards joining the APC and clinching the party’s ticket. Recall that N100 million nomination and expression of interest forms of the ruling party was reportedly bought for former President Jonathan by a northern group on Monday. Jonathan denied knowledge of the move. On the same evening, the former President reportedly paid a visit to the National Chairman of the APC and former Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Adamu, at his residence in Abuja. Sources confirmed that the former President was at Adamu’s residence to seek assurance of the APC before he could decamp from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to the ruling party. Sources privy to their discussions told DAILY POST that although the APC Chairman welcomed the former President to the ruling party, there was absolutely no assurance that he could be handed the party’s presidential ticket.
