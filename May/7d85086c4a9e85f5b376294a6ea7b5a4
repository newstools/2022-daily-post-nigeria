Adamu Garba, a former chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, who abandoned the party over the cost of its nomination forms, has purchased a presidential expression of interest form of the Young Progressives Party (YPP). The presidential hopeful, who declared his intention to run for president under the YPP, one week after he left the APC, told journalists on Tuesday that he was worried over a situation where over 200 million Nigerians cannot feed themselves. Garba warned Nigerian youths that there was no future for them in either the APC or the PDP, calling for a mass exodus from the parties he described as a box for Nigerian youths. He warned that young people have been boxed into a corner in the two popular parties, insisting that the future of Nigeria lies with the YPP. Garba also decried the spate of corruption in the country, citing the recent arrest of the Accountant General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris by the EFCC. DAILY POST reports that Adamu Garba was offered the presidential form at the cost of N 7.5 million as against the N15 million pegged by the party. He, however, explained that he got the 50% discount on the form because he is a young Nigerian under 40 years of age. ”The youth have no future in the APC or PDP. I was a strong member of the PDP in 1999, in 2003 we moved to ANPP and in 2007 we came to PDP and stayed till 2014 when APC founded and we moved,” he said. ”I think there should be no credible person to say youths have no future in APC or PDP because I have identified strongly with the party, fought for the party and was insulted for it but all the young people in the party are mushroomed, packed and dustbined maybe we are waiting for them to set fire on them but we will not be burnt”.
