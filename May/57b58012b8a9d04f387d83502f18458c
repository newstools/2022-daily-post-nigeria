The Hausa Christians Foundation (HACFO) said they would not bow to persecution and killings of faithful in Nigeria’s North. The reaction followed recent events including the gruesome murder of Deborah Samuel. The Shehu Shagari College of Education student was lynched last Thursday in Sokoto State. The European Union (EU), the United Kingdom, the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) and bodies have condemned the murder. In a statement, HAFCO declared that no amount of threats can stop or intimidate Christians. “Death is our servant because we conquered it already. We actually died since we became Christians. “That’s why we are alive. You can’t kill a dead person. These killers are more afraid of death than anyone else. “They thought the way they are hopeless and helpless about their death that’s how we are. Our eternity is secured in Jesus! “We have been crucified with Christ. The life we live now, we live by faith in the Son of God who died for us. “For us to live is Christ and to die is a great gain! Satan, you’re a liar. We can’t go back, we’re going forward and further with the Gospel of Christ.” “We are Hausas and we are Christians”, the statement added.
