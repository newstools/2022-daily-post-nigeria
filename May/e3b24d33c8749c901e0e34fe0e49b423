Newcastle United legend, Alan Shearer, has pinpointed the mistake Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel made in the Blues’ FA Cup final against Liverpool. He said the German tactician missed a trick with his team selection by leaving Timo Werner on the substitutes’ bench. Werner has endured a largely difficult time at Chelsea since joining nearly two years ago from RB Leipzig. Shearer, a Premier League legend feels Werner’s pace on the break would have represented a major threat with the Liverpool boss employing his trademark high defensive line. He told the BBC: “No surprises to me in the Liverpool team that’s pretty much as expected. “With Chelsea, Havertz is injured. But I’m surprised Werner’s not playing, because of his pace, because of the high line we know Liverpool play. “I know he gets offside a lot but it would have been a huge threat for him to be running behind.”
