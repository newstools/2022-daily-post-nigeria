Former Liverpool star, Steve McManaman, has insisted that the club’s management are doing a fantastic job, saying that everything they touch turns to gold at the moment. McManaman said this while giving his verdict on Liverpool’s UEFA Champions League final against Real Madrid on Saturday night in Paris. The 50-year-old, who played for Liverpool and Real Madrid in the past, insisted that the Reds are an impossible team to play against when they are on it. According to him, he wants Liverpool to be successful as they face Real Madrid at the Stade de France. “I’m in a no-win, no-lose situation,” McManaman told DW. “I have got friends in both camps, and all these years on, Real Madrid still have the same kitman and a lot of the same physios working there. “So to see these types of people is an incredible thing that you want them to do well. “But I still work at the Liverpool Academy and I want Liverpool to be successful – that goes without saying.” He added, “Liverpool are an impossible team to play against when they’re on it – and they’re on it all the time it seems. “Even in finals that have gone to extra time, they just always seem to find a way. And they haven’t had an easy run this year, drawn into a group with AC Milan, Atletico Madrid and Porto – they steamrolled the group – and then beating the likes of Inter Milan too. “Klopp has done an exceptional job with the team. I think the staff around Klopp are doing an amazing job. And also the people upstairs who were buying and selling the players – everything they touch seems to turn to gold at this moment.”
