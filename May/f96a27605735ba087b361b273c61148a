Ahead of the All Progressives Congress, APC primary election, Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi, has revealed that he would tender his resignation letter on Monday, May 16. Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari had directed members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) seeking elective positions to resign their appointment and focus on their ambition. Amaechi gave the hint of his resignation in Kaduna on Sunday where he visited the state to canvas the support of APC delegates for the presidential primary. He expressed appreciation to Buhari for the opportunity to serve as Minister. The minister, while discussing with the delegates, revealed that the attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train would not have happened if the Federal Executive Council (FEC) had approved the surveillance contract he requested to monitor the rail track.
