Director-General, Micheal Imoudu National Institute of Labour Studies, MINILS, Ilorin, Comrade Issa Aremu has advocated immediate convocation of an expanded meeting within the context of the statutory National Labour Advisory Council, NLAC, to resume social dialogue on all issues in the ASUU/FG dispute. The call is coming on the heels of street protests by the National Association of Nigerian Students, NANS, against the three months prolonged strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU. The former Nigeria Labour Congress leader lamented that since the return to democratic rule in 1999, ASUU had gone on strike for 50 months, almost five years, adding that strike by lecturers that lasted 18 months under former President Olusegun Obasanjo had truncated the legitimate aspirations of students in public universities to complete their studies in record time. Comrade Aremu, who noted that Nigeria has vibrant and tested institutions for grievance and dispute resolutions, urged both officials of the Education Ministry and the ASUU to take advantage of the tripartite National Labour Advisory Council, suspend current hostilities and resume social dialogue for students to return to classes. He appealed to all parties to resume discussions to salvage the education sector, which had already suffered from poor facilities, brain drain and mismanagement of limited funds. Comrade Aremu noted that President Muhammadu Buhari was mindful of the urgent need to resolve the crisis in his May Day speech. He further expressed solidarity with the students who are out of school due to the prolonged labour crisis.
