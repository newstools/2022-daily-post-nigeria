On Saturday, Chelsea officially confirmed American billionaire, Todd Boehly, as the club’s new owner. In a statement via Chelsea’s website, the Blues confirmed that terms have been agreed for the new ownership group, led by Boehly, to acquire the Stamford Bridge club. Boehly replaces Roman Abramovich, who was Chelsea’s owner for 19 years, following the completion of his £3.5billion takeover. His consortium, which comprises Dodgers co-owner, Mark Walters, British businessman, Jonathan Goldstein, Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss and US investment firm, Clearlake Capital, was named as the preferred bidder to take over Chelsea by the Raine Group, the US bank who are overseeing the sale. What are some of the things you need to know about the new Chelsea owner? 1. Boehly is 46 years old, according to Forbes, worth around £3.6 billion ($4.5bn). 2. He is already a part-owner of both the Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Dodgers. He holds a 27 per cent stake in the Lakers and a 20 per cent stake in the Dodgers. 3. This is not the first time Boehly has shown an interest in football either, with reports suggesting that he tried to buy the West London club back in 2019 as well. Luckily, the sanctions against Roman Abramovich following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, gave him the chance to finally make his move. 4. Boehly’s career began as CS First Boston in New York in 1996, a division of Credit Suisse, after graduating with a degree in finance. He then moved to JH Witney & Co and then to Guggenheim Partners in 2001. 5. Boehly has worked alongside Mark Walter for a considerable length of time, with the latter also part of the Chelsea consortium. Boehly is also known for his philanthropy, having invested in a number of charities.
