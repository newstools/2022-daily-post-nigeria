Pep Guardiola has taken a dig at Roma boss, Jose Mourinho after the Portuguese failed to secure Champions League football for the Italian side next season. Guardiola found a reason to involve Mourinho while attempting to defend his own record in the Champions League. Guardiola led Manchester City to the semi-finals of the competition this season but they bizarrely crashed out to Real Madrid in Spain and are still licking their wounds. City found themselves 5-3 on aggregate heading into the 90th minute at the Bernabeu but conspired to concede twice in injury time and went on to lose 6-5 to La Liga title winners. Pep Guardiola has failed in many attempts to win the Champions League for Manchester City the way he did at Barcelona. He could not also win the trophy while in Germany with Bayern Munich. He said it was not money that make people win the competition, let alone qualify for it. Guardiola in his claims said if money plays a role, Mourinho would not have had a disappointing maiden domestic campaign with Roma, where he failed to qualify for Europe’s elite competition. Mourinho and Roma sit 10 points behind fourth-place Juventus in Serie A with three games remaining. Guardiola said during his press conference ahead of their Premier League game on Sunday, “I know that the people here are obsessed with the Champions League. “The day we win it I’m sure they will say it’s it was because we spent so much money, not for the work behind it “For me, it is not a question of money and the fans do not understand it. Roma has also spent a lot of money but they are not in the Champions League.”
