With only four states left to fully domesticate the Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) VAPP, law, an advocacy pushing for an assent to the VAPP Act earlier passed into law by the Kogi State House of Assembly has commenced with the inauguration of a steering committee to drive the process. At an event put together by the Savannah Centre for Diplomacy, Democracy and Development (SCDDD), members of the steering committee drawn from the media, Civil Society Organisations, representatives of government and faith-based organisations were saddled with the task of ensuring the Bill is signed into law by Governor Yahaya Bello. During its maiden meeting held on Friday evening, members of the steering committee led by its interim chairman, Mr Abu Michael, agreed on a number of strategies it would deploy in prevailing on the State government to assent to the Bill. Parts of the strategies include media day of action where it intends to explore media platforms, as well as engage with key stakeholders towards seeing to the signing and gazetting of the Kogi State Violence Against Persons (Prohibition)- VAPP Bill. Members of the committee expressed optimism that the Bill would attract speedy attention from Governor Bello in view of its objectives of safeguarding the citizens against violence of any kind, and also considering the Governor’s passion for issues of safety, rights, dignity and security of Kogi people. DAILY POST reports that the VAPP law is designed to tackle all forms of violence against persons, in private and public life, as well as provide maximum protection and effective remedies for victims and punishment for offenders. On his part, Senior Program Manager, Savannah Centre for Diplomacy, Democracy and Development(SCDDD), Sir Bola Abimbola urged the committee to discharge the assignment with utmost commitment and dedication, with a view to achieving the desired success.
