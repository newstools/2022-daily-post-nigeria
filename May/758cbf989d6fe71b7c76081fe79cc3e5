A few hours before the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National Convention, a presidential aspirant and former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim, protested alleged alterations in the Ebonyi State delegates list. Ayim, in a letter addressed to the PDP National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, and Chairman of the PDP Special Convention, Senator David Mark, dated May 27, described as disheartening that by 6 pm on Friday, the Ebonyi State delegates list has changed from what was officially published. The letter partly read “The Chairman may refer to my earlier letter of today the 27th day of May 2022 and captioned as above. “I am to observe that shortly after my letter, I noticed in an official publication by the party, a list of Ebonyi State Delegates alongside other states. It is disheartening that by 6 pm today, the Ebonyi State Delegates List has changed from what was officially published. “There is no doubt that the aim of this gamble with Ebonyi State Delegates List is to disenfranchise duly elected delegates from Ebonyi State from participating in the presidential primary election.” He warned that anybody not on the list originally published by the party, is certainly not a delegate from Ebonyi State.
