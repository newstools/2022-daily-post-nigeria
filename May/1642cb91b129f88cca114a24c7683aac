A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in OrukAnam Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State, Sir S J Ntefre, has been shot dead. Ntefre was gunned down by unknown gunmen at his residence in Ekparakwa, leaving behind the vehicle they came with for the operation. It was gathered that the incident happened on Sunday at about 8:00am when the gunmen attempted to abduct him in his compound An eyewitness, who identified herself as Mrs Sarah Williamson, told DAILY POST that the gunmen arrived at the residence of the deceased in a black SUV and dragged him outside while other members of the gang were shooting to scare neighbours. She added that the gunshots attracted youths who raised the alarm against the gunmen causing the whole community to chase the hoodlums. She said by the time the youths started to chase the kidnappers, they had already abducted the party chieftain into the nearby bush and shot him severally while some members of the gang who were waiting in a standby vehicle abandoned it and escaped through the bush. “Community people came out and rolled the vehicle away from that place. I don’t know where they took it but I am sure they ran away leaving the car behind.” It was gathered that the youths quickly searched the bush and discovered the corpse of the party chieftain lying in the pool of his blood . It could be recalled that last Sunday, just a week ago, the Catholic Priest of X Parish along Ekparakwa – Etinan road was abducted and he later regained freedom after four days in the kidnappers’ den. A resident who pleaded anonymity said the killing of the party chieftain may not be unconnected with forthcoming House of Assembly party primaries. The AKwa Ibom state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Odiko Mcdon, said he has not received official report on the incident but promised to react once the command is briefed. “We have not received any report on this, I’ll communicate you as soon as I am briefed,” he said.
