Amaechi described himself as a true Nigerian candidate. “I just got my expression of interest and presidential nomination forms. I appreciate my friends and associates for doing me this honour.  “I assure you that I am a representation of all tribes and regions. A true Nigerian candidate,” he wrote. Recently, the Minister declared his aspiration to become Nigeria’s President in 2023. The APC pegged its presidential forms at N100 million.
