Manchester United legend, Michael Carrick, has backed Arsenal to finish in the fourth position on the Premier League table this season, insisting that Mikel Arteta’s side has had a terrific run. Carrick said this after Arsenal defeated West Ham United 2-1 in a Premier League tie on Sunday. DAILY POST reports that two goals from Rob Holding and Gabriel gave Arsenal all three points against West Ham. Jarrod Bowen did the score for the Hammers at the London Stadium. The result means Arsenal is now in the fourth position on the log, with 2 points ahead of fifth-place Tottenham, after 34 matches. “They have had a terrific run,” Carrick told Premier League Productions. “People ask the question, would you rather have the points in the bag, or would you rather be chasing and without so much pressure? “I would much rather be in a position where it is in your own hands, 100 per cent. And that is where Arsenal have found themselves, so credit to them that they have put themselves in this position. “West Ham was not an easy game for them, but they got the win. It gives them a great chance now.”
