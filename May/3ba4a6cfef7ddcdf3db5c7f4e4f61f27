Paris Saint-Germain are looking to swoop in for Nigeria striker, Victor Osimhen, to replace Kylian Mbappe, GFFN reports. Mbappe’s current deal with the 10-time Ligue 1 champions expires at the end of this season. The 23-year-old has seen his stock rise at the Parc des Princes since he arrived from Monaco. Mbappe has scored 167 times and provided 84 assists in 214 appearances for PSG. However, the Frenchman could leave this summer and has been strongly linked with Real Madrid. PSG have their sights set on 23-year-old Osimhen to replace Mbappe. Osimhen has been outstanding for Napoli since he joined from Lille two years ago. The Super Eagles star is enjoying his best season ever, notching 17 goals and six assists in 29 appearances.
