Manchester City have retained their Premier League title, following a dramatic 3-2 win over Aston Villa on Sunday. The champions were stunned by Steven Gerrard’s men who went two goals up at The Etihad. Matty Cash and Phillippe Coutinho scored either side for Villa. However, City fought back through goals from Ilkay Gundgoan (twice) and Rodrigo to win the title ahead of Liverpool, who beat Wolves 3-1 at Anfield. Arsenal missed out on the last Champions League spot, despite a 5-1 win over Everton at the Emirates. The Gunners were banking on Norwich to upset Tottenham, but Antonio Conte’s men ran out 5-0 winners.
