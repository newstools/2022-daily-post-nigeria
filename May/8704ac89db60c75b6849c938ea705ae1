Aloy Ejimakor, Special Counsel to Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has reacted as an Abuja Federal High Court denied the Biafra agitator bail. Ejimakor said a recent court ruling by an Abia State High Court sitting in Umuahia would have an implication on Justice Binta Nyako’s ruling. Speaking with DAILY POST, the Special Counsel said the ruling of the Umuahia-led court is the only basis for which the Abuja ruling would proceed. Recall that Justice Nyako had denied Kanu’s bail application on Wednesday. The judge said Kanu should explain his whereabouts when he jumped bail in 2017. Reacting, Ejimakor said: “She denied the bail application, but she also ruled that Kanu can reapply for bail with an explanation of why he did not attend court in 2017. This is where the Umuahia judgment will come into play. “The initial bail application (the one denied today) was filed before the Umuahia judgment that impliedly exonerated Kanu from the notion that he had jumped bail in 2017. “Very significant. It’s the only basis upon which the new bail application can proceed.”
