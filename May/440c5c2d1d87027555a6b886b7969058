Chelsea, on Saturday, became the first team to lose three consecutive FA Cup finals after losing to Liverpool at Wembley. Konstantinos Tsimikas converted the deciding penalty to ensure Liverpool defeated Chelsea 6-5 following a 0-0 draw. The defeat to Liverpool also means Chelsea have lost two cup finals to the Reds this season. Chelsea had lost in 2020 to Arsenal; in 2021 to Leicester and now in 2022 to Liverpool – a record no other club has managed to set in the competition. Despite dominating play in the extra time and coming back level during the spot kicks after Mendy saved from Sadio Mane’s penalty, Mason Mount missed target and gave Tsimikas the opportunity to win it for Jurgen Klopp’s side. Chelsea will now shift their attention to the Premier League following their latest defeat. Thomas Tuchel’s side will host Leicester City in a Premier League tie on Thursday.
