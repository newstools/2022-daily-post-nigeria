At least, three persons have lost their lives in Anambra State in two communities in what was said to be a violation of the Monday sit-at-home exercise. The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB had months back announced every Monday to be a day to sit at home, in protest to the extraordinary rendition of its leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu from Kenya last year. The exercise registered huge compliance, mostly as a result of apprehension, as residents feared attacks by members of the group. Although the group later called off the exercise some unidentified persons wielding guns continued to enforce compliance with the exercise. On Monday, while one person was shot dead in Utuh, Nnewi South Local Government Area, two others were shot dead at Ozubulu, Ekwusigo Local Government Area. The men were said to have been shot by gunmen, who protested their violation of the sit-at-home exercise. The two incidences were confirmed by the Anambra State Police Command. The spokesperson of the command, DSP Toochukwu Ikenga who confirmed it said one of the two men shot in Ozubulu was a policeman. “Our men have been deployed to the venue of the incident in Ozubulu. One of the men has been identified as a policeman, while the second is yet to be identified. “Our men also recovered a vehicle at the scene of the incident, but we are not sure yet the owner of the vehicle; whether it belongs to the victims or the assailants. The men have been deposited in a morgue. “As for the incident in Utuh, we are yet to confirm that but our men have been sent there.
Command has also mobilized fully to counter any further attacks,” he told DAILY POST.
