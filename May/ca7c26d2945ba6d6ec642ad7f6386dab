Liverpool forward, Mohamed Salah, has described himself as the ‘best’ in the world in his position. Salah said that the number of goals he has scored for the Reds back up his claim. Currently the Egyptian has 22 league goals to his name this season and is leading the race for the Premier League Golden Boot. Salah has claimed the Golden Boots twice before and picked up the Football Writers’ Association’s Footballer of the Year award for a second time. He has helped Jurgen Klopp’s side win the Champions League in 2019, and the Premier League title in 2020. With the help of Salah, the Reds are chasing the quadruple and have won the Carabao Cup already. “If you compare me with any player in my position, not only in my team but in the world, you will find that I am the best,” Salah told beIN SPORTS. “I always focus on my work and do my best and my numbers are the best proof of my words.”
