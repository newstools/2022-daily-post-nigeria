Former Chelsea manager, Glenn Hoddle has insisted that Arsenal forward, Eddie Nketiah wants to leave Emirates this summer. Hoddle also said that Nketiah would stay at Arsenal if he is given a chance to remain at the North London club. Nketiah has been one of the club’s standout players in recent weeks. However, his future at the Gunners has come into question as his contract is set to expire at the end of the season. West Ham United are believed to be interested in signing him this summer. “I think he probably wants to leave Arsenal, but if he’s given a chance, he will stay. “They will be bending down on their knees to get him to sign a contract,” Hoddle told Premier League Productions.
