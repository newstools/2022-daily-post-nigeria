I’m going to go for attacking players. “Love Mason Mount, what he’s doing. Kovacic at Chelsea. I’ll go for one No.6… I love Fabinho at Liverpool and I love Rodri. “If I had to pick one of them, Kevin De Bruyne, for me, is an absolute specialist midfielder.

Adding “Makelele I’d add to that as well.” Makelele is was a former Chelsea defensive midfielder.
