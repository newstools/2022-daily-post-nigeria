Delegates of the People’s Democratic Party PDP in Taraba State on Wednesday stoned the convoy of the state Governor, Darius Ishaku and his Deputy Haruna Manu at the Catholic Pastoral Centre Jalingo. Our correspondent reports that the Deputy Governor had driven to the voting arena where the election was billed to take place but the delegates in defiance drove the Deputy Governor away with stones. Shortly after, the state Governor’s convoy drove into the arena but was not allowed to stop as the delegates started stoning the convoy insisting that they did not want to talk to the governor and leadership of the party. Some of the delegates who spoke to our correspondent said they were not comfortable with the imposition of the state PDP party Chairman as an aspirant when he was never a part of the process until barely forty-eight hours to the primaries. Our correspondent recalls that posters of Chairman of the party Kefas Agbu who had earlier denied being a part of the governorship race in the state suddenly sprung all over the state capital Jalingo shortly after the former Minister of Defense General Theophilus Danjuma flew into the state and allegedly anointed him as his candidate for the party’s flag ahead of the 2023 general elections. However, the action has sparked widespread condemnation and agitations from stakeholders who insist that they would not have the elder statesman impose a candidate on the party again, more so that the candidate is the seating Chairman of the party and from the same zone as the current governor who is about to complete his second tenure in office. At the time of filing this report, the primary election which is slated to hold at the Jolly Nyame stadium is yet to commence.
