Aspiring adhoc delegates for the Peoples Democratic Party’s primary election have lamented alleged disenfranchisement during the ward congress held on Saturday in Akwa Ibom State. DAILY POST reports that the aspiring delegates, who trooped out with their supporters for the election, were stranded in the various PDP offices across the State. It was observed that election materials were distributed from Maintain Peace Movement office at Udo Udoma, Uyo, rather than the usual State party office at Atan Offot Uyo, the State capital. Some of the aspiring delegates, who spoke with journalists, expressed deep frustration, claiming disenfranchisement, even as they warned that the party should be ready to organise a fresh election or risk legal actions. According to Mr Willy Etim, an aspiring delegate from Uruan Council area, ”I am aware that the materials were safely diverted to politicians’ private homes where the election and the results were being prepared in favour of aspiring delegates selected by MPM officers, we are waiting for their next line of action.” Also, Mr Paulinus Ekong, an aspiring delegate from Uyo told Journalists that election materials did not arrive at the designated centres. Meanwhile, information gathered by our correspondent, who visited Ikot Ekpene, Obot Akara, Ika, Ibesikpo Asutan ITU and Oruk Anam Local Government Areas exposed lack of election materials at the official designated election centres, with thousands of people stranded. Several calls put to the Party Chairman, Mr Aniekan Akpan by journalists for his reaction were not answered, while a text message to him is yet to be replied as at press time.
