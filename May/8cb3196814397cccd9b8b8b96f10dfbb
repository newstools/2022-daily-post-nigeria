Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo has condemned the killing of a 200-level student of Shehu Shagari College of Education in Sokoto, Deborah Samuel. Osinbajo described Deborah’s murder over alleged blasphemy as deeply distressing. He said there was no justification for extra-judicial killing because there were legal channels of addressing any misdeed. The Vice President spoke to journalists in Abuja, upon his arrival from Uyo, Akwa Ibom State. Osinbajo commended President Muhammadu Buhari and the Sultan of Sokoto for condemning the incident. According to Osinbajo: “Let me say that, first, the President has reacted to this, in a statement which was issued earlier condemning the action. “I must say that it’s a deeply distressing thing, very disturbing – such an atrocious killing of the young lady by a mob who took the law into their own hands; I think it’s very unfortunate. “The swift reaction of the Sokoto State Government and also the Sultan of Sokoto is highly commendable. “I think that their swift reaction to the situation clearly demonstrates the outrage of millions of Nigerians and also the desire of everyone to ensure that the perpetrators are quickly apprehended and prosecuted. “As the President said, there’s really no excuse for anyone to take the law into their own hands no matter the provocation, there are set processes for ensuring that we are able to redress whatever wrongs that are done against us.”
