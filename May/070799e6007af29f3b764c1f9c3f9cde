Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp, on Friday described Manchester City’s Champions League elimination as a massive blow, insisting that everybody was ready to switch the television off. DAILY POST reports that Man City was knocked out of the Champions League semi-final at the hands of Real Madrid on Wednesday. Pep Guardiola’s men seemed to be sailing towards a second consecutive Champions League final when Riyad Mahrez struck in the 73rd minute against Real Madrid to make it 1-0 and put the Premier League champions on a 5-3 aggregate score. However, two late goals from Rodrygo in added time took the tie to extra-time before Karim Benzema’s penalty sealed a monumental comeback victory for Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu. Asked for his response to Man City’s European demise ahead of Liverpool’s must-win Premier League clash against Tottenham at Anfield on Saturday, Klopp said at his pre-match press conference: “It was a massive blow. Everybody was ready to switch the television off and then all of a sudden, part two started and that was really harsh I can imagine. “I had nights like this. It’s not cool, the next morning is not enjoyable. “But then there is a moment when you realise you cannot change it anymore and focus on the next thing, and for them, that’s Newcastle on Sunday and they will be ready.”
