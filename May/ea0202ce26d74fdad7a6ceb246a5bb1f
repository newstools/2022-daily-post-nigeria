The Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 2023 National Convention Organizing Committee, Senator David Mark, charged party delegates to consider the interest of the people in their decisions. The former President of the Senate also urged party faithful across the country to imbibe the spirit of sportsmanship in the conduct of the exercises. Mark, in a statement by his media adviser, Paul Mumeh, Thursday appealed to PDP members to comply with the rules as the primaries begin with the election of candidates for the state Houses of Assembly seats on Saturday. The statement partly read, “The party has clear guidelines and rules for the exercises. Every aspirant should be guided by the processes. The party will not compromise any of the rules. “He counselled delegates to the congresses and conventions to consider the integrity and past accomplishments of aspirants to make informed choices of candidates for the elections. “In making your decisions, consider the interest of the people. Politics is a conveyor belt to serve humanity. The greater interest of our people is paramount.“ He also cautioned against politics of acrimony, bitterness or violence charging all aspirants to embrace and support whoever emerges. Mark added that whoever emerges from the open and transparent elections must be the choice of the people. The former President of the Senate urged all aspirants and their supporters alike to refrain from combative or inflammatory statements to avoid unnecessary provocation.
