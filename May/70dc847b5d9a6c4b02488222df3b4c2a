Adaku Ogbu-Aguocha has emerged as the Senatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, for Enugu East Senatorial zone. The party chieftain was elected during a primary election in Enugu on Saturday, where she ran as the only contestant. Chairman of the election Committee, Abigail Igwe announced that out of the 385 total delegates, 289 were accredited for the election. She said Ogbu-Aguocha polled 270 votes. There were 14 voided votes. Igwe explained that although the party had only one aspirant for the election, it was necessary to do the needful, adding that the exercise was peaceful. In a remark after the election, Ogbu-Aguocha said a time had come to give the constituents deserved representation. “Now is the time for us to wake up and be actively involved in all the decision making processes at the National Assembly,” she said. She added that those who think it was their birthright to rule should prepare to retire home. Ogbu-Aguocha, from Nara Unataeze in Nkanu East, will slug it out against Senator Chimaroke Nnamani who currently represents the zone. Nnamani, a former Governor of Enugu State, has already emerged the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, candidate for the election. DAILY POST reports that Ogbu-Aguocha also in 2019 won the same Senatorial ticket but her name was wrongly substituted with another member of the party. She approached the court for redress and her mandate was returned.
