The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami has denied reports making the rounds that he purchased and distributed expensive cars to delegates ahead of the Kebbi State governorship election. DAILY POST reports that the Minister had five days ago, declared his intention to run for the office of the Kebbi State governor. Subsequently, reports emerged that he procured about 30 cars for delegates that would vote for him during the All Progressives Congress, APC, primary election in the state. The report triggered a backlash from Nigerians who demanded that the minister be probed to unravel his source of income. However, in an interview with journalists in Birnin Kebbi, the state capital, on Tuesday, Malami said he and his friends are innocent of the accusations. He said, “At this moment, I have experienced a barrage of attacks, left, right and centre, some are local and others international, an attack that has to do with an allegation that I shared many expensive vehicles to delegates of APC. “As a person with some associates, neither I nor a friend of mine shared any vehicle to any delegate across the state.”
