Florentino Perez, Real Madrid president, has commented on reports linking Paris Saint-Germain’s Kylian Mbappe to Los Blancos. Mbappe has been heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid this summer. His contract with PSG will expire at the end of the season and the France World Cup winner is keen to join the LaLiga champions. Speaking to Movistar in the wake of Real Madrid’s La Liga triumph on Saturday, Perez was asked about Mbappe’s reported transfer to the Santiago Bernabeu, he said: “I hadn’t thought about it [Mbappe], but now that you mention it, it might be true and so on.” He added: “When we plan next year’s squad, we’ll see.” Meanwhile, Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti, gave a cryptic response, telling beIN Sports when asked about Mbappe: “Mbappe to Real Madrid? With this club, with this president, the future is already written.” However, when asked if that was meant as a confirmation that the deal was done, the Italian replied: “I didn’t say that.”
