No fewer than seven farmers have been killed by terrorists in their farmlands in Faru community of Maradun Local Government Area of Zamfara State, in the early hours of Saturday. According to one Garba Abdullahi, who is an indigene of the community, the farmers were working in their farmlands, preparing for this year’s farmig season, when the bandits attacked and killed them. The eyewitness narrated to DAILY POST on phone that one of his relations, Sani Akwala was among the people killed during the attack. “Sani Akwala was among those who were killed gruesomely by these blood-sucking criminal elements,” he lamented. He explained that the bandits had for a long time been terrorising the axis since the beginning of this year’s farming season. According to him, the bandits had earlier warned that that there would be no farming activities in the area this year. “They have been going round the farmlands in that area to ensure that no farming activity would take place in the area. “We are not hoping for any farming activity this year because everyone is afraid of dying. We are, therefore, appealing to the government and the security agencies to come to our aid before they kill all of us. “As it is now, the situation is calling for a well-coordinated security network,” he stressed. However, all efforts to get a reaction from the State’s Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), SP Mohammed Shehu proved abortive.
