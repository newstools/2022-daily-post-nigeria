The Palace of the Soun of Ogbomoso has been burgled, DAILY POST learnt. It was also gathered that the yet-to-be identified burglars injured the Aremole of Ogbomoso, one of the palace chiefs. The main entrance aluminum sliding doors and the exit door leading to Soun administrative office were all destroyed. The desecration that happened on Thursday was confirmed by Toyin Ajamu, Soun of Ogbomoso palace secretary to our reporter. DAILY POST recalls that since December 2021 when the Oba Jimoh Oyewumi, the Soun of Ogbomoso died, the stool has been vacant, under some controversial circumstances. However, contrary to reports making the rounds, Ajamu said the traditional crown was not stolen from the vacated palace. He added, “To put the record straight, there was no crown at the palace as the seat of Soun of Ogbomosoland is presently vacant with no crown and nothing whatsoever is being stolen except that he destroyed the main entrance aluminum sliding doors and the exit door leading to Soun administrative office from the palace”.
