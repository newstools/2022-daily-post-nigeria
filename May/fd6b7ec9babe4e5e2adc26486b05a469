Residents of Ifon town have urged the Osun State Government to come to the rescue of a baby and his mentally-challenged mother. Workers at the Orolu local government secretariat, who informed DAILY POST of the development, revealed that the woman, identified as Kafilat, had refused her family custody of the child, accusing them of a plot to use him for money ritual. An employee of the local government who craved anonymity said the state government has a responsibility of helping such persons. He noted that the past administration in the state had established a rehabilitation centre at Ilobu with the sole intention of rehabilitating and reuniting the destitute with their family. “The family of the woman has tried all they could to take away the boy from her mother but she is always accusing them of wanting to use him for rituals. The situation now is beyond our capacity. The state government should intervene through the Ministry of Women and Children and Social Affairs. “Non-governmental Organisations can also be of help to the child. The illness of the mother can also be cured if given proper medical attention. Sometimes, she speaks well when she gains her sanity while she speaks incoherently sometimes. “We have a rehabilitation centre at Ilobu during the last administration of Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola. This is where such illness is treated,” the source said. Kafilat, an indigene of Ifon, is said to have been in possession of the child, who is about a year old since he was born. She revealed that her family had refused to take care of her since the onset of her illness and also claimed that her parents-in-law chased her out of her matrimonial home. Kafilat also revealed that she does not know the name of her baby because it was not revealed to her due to her condition at birth. She added that she was looking toward getting proper medicare. The Osun State Ministry of Women, Children and Social Affairs is yet to confirm if they have stepped in to arrest the situation.
