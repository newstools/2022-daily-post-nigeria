A retiree, identified as Funso Adeyemi, and her daughter, Bola, have allegedly been abducted on their way to Ondo State. According to family sources, the duo were on their way to Ondo State for an event on the 17th of May, 2022, when they were kidnapped. Their private car was later found abandoned along the Ibadan-Ilesha expressway and their relatives and friends are now worried over their whereabouts. It was gathered that no one has been contacted by the alleged kidnappers for ransom, fueling speculations that their abduction may not be money motivated. In an interview with a family source, it was revealed that a member of the family – who works in the media space – had previously been receiving threats from some individuals – including many celebrities – who are not comfortable with his blunt reportage about them, however, it is yet to be established if the alleged abduction is a way of finally getting back at him. An official report has been made to the police but no success has so far been recorded in tracking or rescuing them. According to Mrs. Adeyemi’s husband, Williams, his wife was in contact with him all through the journey until around 3 p.m, when she suddenly went out of reach. An attempt to call their daughter, Bola, also proved abortive, as her phone initially rang out but was later switched off.
