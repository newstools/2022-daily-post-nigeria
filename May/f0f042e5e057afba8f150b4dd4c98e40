The Leader Of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, on Monday, warned a South-East presidential hopeful, Peter Obi against his presidential ambition. Primate Ayodele disclosed that Obi cannot contest the presidential election and win, hence he should resign from politics or help suffering Nigerians with his resources. In a statement by his Media Aide, Oluwatosin Osho, the cleric attested to Obi’s leadership qualities, but noted that he doesn’t have the backing of God for the presidential election, coupled with the fact that he was misled into joining another party to pursue his ambition. He also mentioned that South-East leaders have successfully jeopardized the chances of the zone in the 2023 presidential ambition. Ayodele noted that the coming generation will remember their actions and curse them for bringing such a predicament to the zone. “There is no way Peter Obi can contest and win, it’s either he resigns from politics or wastes his money. Better still, he should help Nigerians that are suffering with his resources. “He was misled into joining the Labour Party to pursue his presidential ambition; he has missed it, Igbos have missed it already, their generations to come will remember this and curse them. “The South-East political leaders have successfully jeopardized the chances of the Igbos and turned the zone to something else. “Igbo have no leaders; they don’t like themselves at all, Peter Obi is a fantastic leader, but he cannot become the next president of Nigeria, any party that gives him ticket will be a waste of time.” Primate Ayodele had warned the South-East leaders not to allow the presidency elude them in 2023 because of their selfish interests and betrayal. He had noted that for peace to reign, the South-East deserves to produce a president but if the leaders are not careful, they will miss it.
