Tex Okechukwu, the National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, has described as fake and unfounded, news report purporting the removal of Ozonkpu Victor Ike Oye, as the national chairman of the party. The said report is to the effect that a party member, Chief Edozie Njoku has assumed the position. Reacting, Okechukwu, in a statement forwarded to DAILY POST on Thursday, reiterated that there was no such Supreme Court review that altered the status quo. According to the APGA spokesman, “it is high time these criminal mauruders be brought to book. The news is false, fake and unfounded. This nonsense must stop. “APGA does not have any other faction and does not have any other national chairman, except Ozonkpu Dr Victor Ike Oye. Oye is a responsiblle, respectable chairman of the third largest political party in Nigeria, a distinguished and law abiding citizen of Nigeria, therefore, deserves respect. “It is obvious that these meddlesome interlopers need to be taught some hard lessons to curb their excesses”. Okechukwu warned that the integrity of the apex court of Nigeria must not be ridiculed or brought to disrepute by anybody whosoever, maintaining that intermittent abuse and publication of the Supreme Court’s orders or judgements by party chieftains, Edozie Njoku and Jude Okeke, and as well, their co-travellers must be addressed with serious quantum measure to avoid unprecedented crisis. “The Supreme Court should frown seriously at this and take immediate action to redress such malevolent libelous publications which impugn on the revered integrity of the Supreme Court of Nigeria, APGA, the national chairman, Dr Victor Ike Oye and Nigeria at large. “The Supreme Court of Nigeria should look into this matter and bring these offenders to book,” he said.
