Russia has said there is no chance of President Vladimir Putin declaring war on Ukraine on May 9. May 9 is the country’s Victory Day, and Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov dismissed those reports as “nonsense.” Russia said it is currently on a ‘special military operation’ in Ukraine and analysts and Western officials previously said they believe that on May 9, Putin could formally declare war. Dmitry Peskov told CNN that the speculations were nonsense when asked what the chances were of Putin declaring war on Victory Day, adding, “none.” “No, this is nonsense.” Speaking further, he also rejected reports that President Putin may use Victory Day to announce mobilization in the country, which would allow the government not just to assemble troops but also to put the economy on a war footing. May 9, known as “Victory Day” inside Russia, commemorates the country’s defeat of the Nazis in 1945. It is marked by a military parade in Moscow, and Russian leaders traditionally stand on the tomb of Vladimir Lenin in Red Square to observe it. Putin has a keen eye for symbolism, having launched the invasion of Ukraine the day after Defender of the Fatherland Day, another crucial military day in Russia, leading Western officials to believe he would use May 9 to either announce a military achievement in Ukraine, a major escalation of hostilities or both.
