An aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the House of Representatives in Osun State, Muslihudeen Adekilekun has dumped the party. He was seeking the APC ticket for Ede North/Ede South/Egbedore/Ejigbo Federal Constituency in the 2023 general elections. Adekilekun who spoke to journalists in Ede on Saturday, also announced the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) as his new political platform. Citing imposition of candidates as his decision to dump the APC, Adekilekun disclosed that he had been contributing to the growth of the APC in Osun since 2011. He added that despite his many contributions to the growth of the party in the federal constituency, leaders often imposed candidates during party primaries, thereby making his sacrifice, loyalty and dedication all to no avail. Maintaining that the party operated like a cult in Ede, he revealed that the APC had transformed into a party that encouraged bribery over loyalty, preferred godfatherism to popularity/acceptability. He added that honouring and forcing party members to accept newcomers over faithful members and encouraging manipulation instead of integrity were all the hallmarks of the party. Members of the APC in Osun had in recent times been protesting imposition of candidates on them. They have also been alleging that the party leadership had been ignoring them and was only doing the bidding of the Governor. On Sunday, May 8, 2022, APC members in Ilesa West Local Government had protested to the Osogbo residence of Adegboyega Famodun, the State party chairman and called for an end to imposition of candidates.
