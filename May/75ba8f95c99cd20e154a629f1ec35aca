Real Madrid captain, Karim Benzema, has said he is not angry Kylian Mbappe snubbed a move to the club to remain at Paris Saint-Germain. Benzema, however, admitted he wanted his compatriot to join him in the Spanish capital. Mbappe was widely expected to sign for the LaLiga champions as a free agent this summer. But the 23-year-old opted to commit to PSG for another three years, sparking outrage among some figures in La Liga. But Benzema told Canal+: “It was a long year for him, he had to decide. “It’s his choice, I wish him the best although, as I said before, I would have liked him to play at Real Madrid.” He continued to Movistar+: “I prefer not to talk. I’m not angry, I can just tell you that I’m focused on the Champions League final [against Liverpool on Saturday] which is more important than listening to anything else. “Now is not the time to talk about these little things.”
