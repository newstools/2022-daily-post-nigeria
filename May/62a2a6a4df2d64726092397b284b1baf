Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba, has reportedly told his club’s rival, Manchester City, he will move elsewhere when his contract with the Red Devils expires this summer. Reports had earlier emerged that Man City were interested in signing Pogba, this summer with the 29-year-old, set to become a free agent in July. Man City manager, Pep Guardiola, is looking for a central midfielder to replace the veteran midfielder Fernandinho, who is set to exit the Etihad when his deal expires this summer. Pogba was among those on the shortlist at Man City, although the Citizens are unable to make a formal approach until the end of the season, while foreign clubs have been able to formally sound out a move since January. However, according to The Athletic, it appears Pogba is not prepared to swap Man United for Man City as there is an offer on the table from a different club which is a better proposition. The France World Cup winner is almost certainly set to leave Old Trafford when his current contract runs out with his second spell at Man United, following a then world-record transfer fee of £89million in 2016, not going according to plan. Pogba has struggled for consistency as Man United have continued to underperform following the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson. He is also attracting attention from Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona and Real Madrid.
