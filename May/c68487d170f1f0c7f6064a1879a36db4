Chairman of Cross River State Independent Electoral Commission (CROSIEC), Mike Ushie has stated that it will be impossible to say that there will not be vote buying during the upcoming local government council elections next year, May 24. He spoke in Calabar when he announced that his Commission will endeavour to make the second Council elections to be better than that of 2015. “This LGA election is going to be an improvement of what we did in the last election. We did a good and commendable job. Next year, we will do our best. But if I stand here and tell you that there will be no vote buying, I will be lying. “However, we will be proactive to curtail it and make sure that the right thing is done. I don’t have the capacity to sit here and tell you that there will be no vote buying,” Ushie said. The CROSIEC boss said that all electoral activities commence for the council election starts immediately and will culminate on Wednesday 24 May, 2023 which is the date for the Council elections.
