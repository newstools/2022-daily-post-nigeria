The 2023 presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Mr Peter Obi, has hinted on some challenges bedeviling the country which his administration would tackle if he emerges winner of the forthcoming 2023 presidential election. Obi, who clinched the party’s ticket on Monday, said his government would focus on eradicating insecurity which has relatively crippled the nation’s economy. During his acceptance speech, the former governor of Anambra state also revealed that his government would ensure food security, and unemployment. The presidential candidate, who recently resigned his membership of the main opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, urged his supporters to ensure they get their Permanent Voters Card, PVCs, ahead of the elections. He said, “Our governance mission will be twin-tracked. Secure Nigeria in every ramification: national security, human security, food security and tackling insecurity created by unemployment. “We will also seek to unite our nation by pulling our people out of poverty, and creating a new sense of nationalism and patriotism. “Nigeria shall rise again: and her people will be proud to claim ownership of her patrimony. Doing so is in our collective national interest.”
