An All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential aspirant, Bola Tinubu, has reacted to the growing number of those aspiring for the party’s ticket. Tinubu said it becomes more challenging with more presidential aspirants. He, however, noted that “the more, the merrier,” adding that such is good for Nigeria’s democracy. Tinubu spoke after a closed-doors meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House. He stressed that the trend of having more presidential aspirants was in the best interest of Nigeria. “The more the merrier. The more they come, the more challenging it becomes for you to think deeply, focus on issues and be ready to serve Nigeria. “It’s all about service, it’s nothing else. Think wisely, get committed to your thinking to serve the nation and bring progress and prosperity to the lives of Nigerians. “It’s good for the country for so many of us to aspire to want to lead, we’re not abandoning our nation. But there’s only one chair and one possibility. We will do that.” So far, APC presidential aspirants include: Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo; Tinubu; Rotimi Amaechi, Minister of Transportation; Dave Umahi, Ebonyi State Governor; Rochas Okorocha, Imo West Senator; Yahaya Bello, Governor of Kogi State; Emeka Nwajiuba, Minister of State for Education. Others are Adams Oshiomhole, former Governor of Edo; Kayode Fayemi, Ekiti State Governor; Godswill Akpabio, Minister of Niger Delta and Chris Ngige, Minister of Labour and Employment.
