The command spoke on the incident via a statement issued on Monday by Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Suleiman Nyuroje, expressing regret about the deceased. “The Commissioner of Police, CP Sikiru Akande, has strongly condemned the recent conflict between Police officers and military along Numan Road that resulted in an exchange of fire and murder of a military officer, all in their line of duty to protect the citizenry,” the statement said. It said the state police commissioner had ordered the immediate arrest of suspects and an investigation into the matter with a view to ensuring peace and justice. The police command stressed that all its operatives suspected to have been involved in the conflict had been ordered to report at police headquarters in Yola. “The CP warns that attacks on all security officers in the line of duty would no longer be tolerated under whatever guise, as the command holds the lives of all security personnel sacrosanct, and such unwarranted conflict would be strictly treated in accordance with extant laws,” the statement said. The statement quoted the Commissioner of Police as stressing that it is vital to work with sister security agents in protecting the fundamental rights of security operatives, in order to enable them to advance their sacred mandate of serving and protecting the citizens better. “The police boss appealed for calm as the top management of both security agencies are doing everything legally possible to address the situation,” the statement concluded.
