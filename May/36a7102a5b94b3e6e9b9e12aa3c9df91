Former Chelsea, Arsenal and Barcelona midfielder, Cesc Fabregas, has revealed his next plan after confirming that he will not be returning to Monaco next season. Fabregas said he would find a new project and see where the future takes him, adding that he has suffered a lot this year. The 35-year-old said he has received a couple of phone calls from some of his former managers to join them as a coach. The Spaniard endured a disappointing season in the French Ligue 1, playing just twice after a succession of injuries kept him on the sidelines. Asked if he could stay put at Monaco, Fabregas told So Foot: “No, it’s sure that it is over between Monaco and me. My contract expires next June, and I’m looking for a fresh start. My head needs a fresh start elsewhere. “It has been not only the worst year of my career but the worst year of my life because when I am not happy in football, I can’t be happy in life. “I have suffered a lot this year; it has been difficult mentally.” “To be honest, I received a couple of phone calls in the last couple of weeks from former managers to see whether I was open to joining them as a coach,” he added. “But this year has been so bad that I can’t end like this, not after having constructed this career. I want to continue playing.” “I’m open to anything, I just want to enjoy myself. The place does not really matter. I’m going to find a new project and see where the future takes me.”
