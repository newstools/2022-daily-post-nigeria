Ahead of the 2023 general elections, a socio-political activist, Reno Omokri has called on the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, to focus on preaching Christ and refrain from promoting the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo. Omokri made the call while reacting to comments from Head of Politics and Governance of RCCG, Pastor Timothy Olaniyan, who claimed that the Vice President remained the best candidate to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. DAILY POST reports that prior to Osinbajo’s declaration to run for the office of the Nigerian President in 2023, the RCCG set up a Politics Directorate across the county to support members vying for elective positions. According to Omokri, the church can pray for the VP but not campaign for him. In a post on his verified Facebook page, he urged the General Overseer, Pastor E. A. Adeboye to call his members to order. He said, “‪It is very dangerous for the Redeemed Christian Church of God to politically promote Osinbajo. Churches are meant to promote Christ. If churches and mosques start promoting candidates, then, they are no longer religious organisations and should start paying tax!‬ “It is alright for the candidates to visit the church and Pastor Adeboye for prayers and his blessings. But when the Redeemed Christian Church of God sets up a politics directorate, and the head of that unit starts openly campaigning for Osinbajo, in his official capacity, then things are falling apart! “‪G.O Adeboye should call RCCG’s political directorate to order before they start what they can’t finish!”‬
