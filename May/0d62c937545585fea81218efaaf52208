Chelsea legend, Frank Leboeuf, has told the club’s winger, Christian Pulisic, to leave Stamford Bridge this summer amid a link to Juventus. Leboeuf said he doesn’t see the American international playing for Chelsea next season. According to him, Pulisic is more influential in his country’s national team than in Chelsea squad, adding that if he wants to continue to be the captain of the US national team, he must leave the Blues for another club. “Pulisic is more influential for the national team than for Chelsea,” Leboeuf told ESPN. “I think with the future of Chelsea, I don’t see him playing a lot. “It is more advice than me wanting to see him leave. But if he wants to play next season and still wants to be the captain of America, he will have to find another team. “If Christian Pulisic stays with Timo Werner, Kai Havertz, Mason Mount and maybe another one coming in, I don’t see him playing. “He has never shown that it’s absolutely crucial to have him in the team so I think he has to go.” Pulisic has scored 25 goals in 115 appearances for Chelsea since completing a £58m move from Borussia Dortmund in 2019.
