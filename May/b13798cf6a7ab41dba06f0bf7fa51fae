Aston Villa striker, Ollie Watkins, has made his pick in the long-running GOAT (Greatest Of All Time) debate between Paris Saint-Germain’s Lionel Messi and Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo. Messi and Ronaldo have been part of probably the greatest player rivalry in history. The duo have dominated the discourse with their incredible achievements over the past 15 years. Even though the pair are currently in the twilight of their careers – Ronaldo is 37, while Messi turns 35 in June – the debate over who is the best rages on. And the latest player to weigh in on this is Watkins, who was asked to choose between them in a video put out by ESPN FC on YouTube. Titled ‘Asking professional footballers: Messi or Ronaldo?’, it features a host of players from various teams from various leagues giving their verdict on the debate. When Watkins was confronted with the question, he pondered for two seconds before coming up with his answer – “Ronaldo!”. Of all the players in the video, Watkins was the only one who explicitly gave Ronaldo’s name, while most of the group said “both.” Messi, however, was the winner in this instance with a score of 7-5. Watkins’ teammates Emiliano Buendia and Morgan Sanson both went with the Argentina captain, while Ronaldo’s former teammate Dejan Kulusevski was unable to answer.
