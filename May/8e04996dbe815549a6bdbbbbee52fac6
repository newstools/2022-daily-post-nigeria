Retired Justice of the Supreme Court, Justice Mary Odili has declared that the judgement that brought in senator Duoye Diri as Bayelsa state governor was well deserved. Justice Odili who led the panel of the Supreme Court Justices that decided the matter said the suit was decided on merit. She was speaking during a book presentation in her honour held in Port Harcourt on Monday. Justice Odili said she was not perturbed by the criticisms that trailed the judgement in 2020 and the claims that she had an interest in the matter. She said she had always decided matters with the consciousness that she will have to answer to God one day about her life. She said ” like I tell people, that case of Bayelsa was a case decided by God himself. None of us in that panel foresaw what was going to happen. “Everyone who read the file had their hands on the head because there was nothing else to do than to give the judgement to the person who deserved that judgement. “So when people were asking, are you not worried? I said I cannot be worried. Since God decided that this is the man who should occupy that seat, who am I or my colleagues to say otherwise? “We had to do it as the law had dictated that we do it. If the haven fell, too bad, that is the way it was”. She also disclosed that she rejected calls by some people for her to recuse herself from the matter because of her “closeness to Bayelsa State”. Justice Odili retired from the Supreme Court last week having attained the compulsory retirement age of 70. She had on February 13, 2020, led a panel of Justices of the Supreme Court court who sacked David Lyon as the Gov-elect of the state. Lyon was replaced by Diri on the eve of his planned swearing-in ceremony as Bayelsa state governor.
