Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has stated categorically that the presidential ticket of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) should be zoned to the south. He said while presidential aspirants from the south have also indicated interest, for fairness and equity, the ticket should be ceded to the south. Sanwo-Olu stated this on Tuesday in Abuja after submitting his completed governorship form, said for justice and equity that the presidential ticket of the party should be zoned to the south. His words: “That’s unfair for you to say we did not arrive at a consensus. You should have asked what was the objective? Did we achieve the objective of that meeting? The answer is yes. We needed to have ourselves in the room, lock up ourselves and have frank conversation which was exactly what we did. “Are we going to have further conversation with the leadership? Yes, I believe so. So we are not fed up, we were sincere with ourselves and we hope that in future engagement all the aspirations we have in our region will come to pass.” Asked if Southern presidency still stands considering the fact that aspirants from the North have also picked forms, Sanwo-Olu said he believed so. He added: “I think we believe so and I think. That’s what is fair, that is what is just. But it is really about Nigeria. There are aspirations everywhere and there are so many qualified people but for equity and fairness,, I think it is just morally fair that it goes to that part (south) and South-west is top-notch in that. We believe that our positions from those meetings are still very valid and everybody must consider.” Sanwo-Olu described the three and half years he has spent in office as years of monumental changes, saying his confidence was premised on the fact that he has received tremendous support from the citizens of Lagos.
