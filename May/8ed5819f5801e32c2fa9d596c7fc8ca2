Our correspondent who was at the venue however gathered that the primary has been postponed, though it was not officially announced. While some people said that the primary has been postponed indefinitely, others are of the opinion that the primary would be held tomorrow, Friday. Our correspondent reports that the primary election was postponed Thursday evening after the Chairman of the electoral committee, Senator Tokunbo Afikuyomi, Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) in the state, Barrister Mutiu Agboke and the aspirants had arrived. Those that were seen at the venue included Folarin, Adelabu, Adeduntan, Agbaje and Alao. All efforts made by the journalists, who were at the venue to know the main reason for the postponement proved to be abortive, although, some sources who spoke in confidence, explained that the primary was postponed due to security challenges. The rumour of the postponement became glaring when Afikuyomi, Agboke, the aspirants and security agents were leaving the venue. This made the journalists who had been waiting for the time of the primary election to also leave the venue.
