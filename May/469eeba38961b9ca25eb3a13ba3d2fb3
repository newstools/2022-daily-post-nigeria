The leadership of the ruling All Progressive Congress, APC Ebonyi State, Stanley Okoro Emegha has condemned the gruesome murder of a security guard and 3 brothers of Ikwo LGA council chairman, Stephen Orogwu. Okoro made the condemnation in a statement signed and made available to journalists in Abakaliki. He described the killings as most barbaric and unfortunate, stressing that the burning of the house of the Chairman came at a time when Ebonyi is being celebrated as the most peaceful and economic vibrant state in the country. He expressed sadness that the perpetrators of the dastardly act do not project the image of the state in good light nor do they represent the paragon or ideals of the people. According to him: “I am deeply saddened that these unscrupulous elements could strike in this manner but they should rest assured that security searchlight has been beamed on them as they will within the shortest time be apprehended and prosecuted in line with the law”. “I want to reiterate the fact that there is no safe haven for crimes in the state. For some of them that engage in guerrilla warfare, the security personnel will not and never allow them to threaten the existing peace in the state”. “May I also console the family of elder Orogwu and the entire people of Ikwo Local Government Area for the unfortunate incident. May Almighty God grant the deceased eternal rest in his bosom” he stated.
