A Public Health Physician, Levin Damisah says healthful meals, snacks, drinks and other healthy lifestyle choices can prevent stroke. The expert spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Abuja. He described stroke as a damage to the brain, a result of interruption of blood supply. Damisah listed symptoms as trouble walking, speaking and understanding, paralysis or numbness of the face, arm or leg. The doctor told the public that early treatment with medication like tPA (clot buster) can minimize brain damage. He said high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, high blood cholesterol levels, heavy drinking, high salt, high fat diet and lack of exercise increase the risk of stroke. For prevention, Damisah recommended blood pressure medications for people diagnosed with hypertension, adopting a healthy lifestyle, regular exercises and adequate sleep. He mentioned healthy weight, regular physical activity, abstinence from smoking, limiting alcohol consumption, checking cholesterol and controlling blood pressure as habits that guide against the disease. “Stroke is commonly associated with aged people, but in recent times, younger people have begun to get hypertensive and obese too. “Good and sustained blood pressure control is key to preventing stroke,” he added.
