Two persons died on Tuesday when a tanker rammed into a truck at the Ogere axis of the Lagos-Ibadan highway. The Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE) said the tanker rammed into the stationed Daf truck from behind, while the driver of the Daf truck was fixing a tyre at the time. TRACE spokesman, Babatunde Akinbiyi, said the tanker driver may have been speeding or dosing on steering when he lost control and rammed into the truck. Akinbiyi explained that the incident, which occurred at 8am, involved a Mack tanker with registration number T 12001 LA and a Daf truck with No registration number. He added that one of the three persons involved in the accident also sustained injuries. “The two deceased were from the tanker while the tanker driver also sustained injuries,” Akinbiyi said.
