Sky Sports pundit, Graeme Souness, has said only Cristiano Ronaldo and David de Gea impressed among Manchester United players this season. The Red Devils will go five years without a trophy, while also finishing outside the top four places. But Ronaldo has continued to score at 37, netting 24 times this campaign. De Gea, meanwhile, has been kept busy between the sticks due to the team’s defensive weakness but has made some fine saves. Souness believes the duo are the only players who can hold their heads high. “You’d like to think you’ll get honesty from the players. “You’ll like to think the players are playing for their futures at that club because there must be question marks over so many of them. So many have underperformed, we know they’re better. But it’s okay for us to say that, but they have to go out and do it. “Near enough to a man, Ronaldo’s chipped in with goals and the goalkeeper [De Gea], maybe. Other than that, you’re struggling to find anyone that you would say is anything like a Man United player,” Souness said.
