Reality TV star, Ifuennada, has responded to criticisms over her outfit to the Africa Movie Viewers Choice Awards, AMVCA. Ifuennada wore a transformation black dress with human skulls, which had Nigerians, fashion buffs criticising her. Responding to her critics, the reality star on Sunday disclosed that her entire look to the eighth edition of the AMVCA was worth over $100,000. She warned that those too broke to afford such money are not qualified to criticize her look, adding that she brought the Hollywood style ‘Met Gala’ to Nollywood. Her post read: “ First of all, I want to thank everyone who saw and understood the creativity and beauty in my AMVCA Transformer Look last night. “Now, to those Critics who wrote cr@p about my Look or intentionally posted my Look just to bash me, here’s what I have to say; “My entire look is worth over 100k USD… Yes you read that right! So if you don’t have a minimum of 10k USD in a domiciliary account, you have no right to speak on my Look. “Basically, stay away from criticising my outfit if you are a broke a**.” According to her, her aim of choosing that look was to shake the internet not to win Best dressed which she achieved. “Lastly, I’m not one to please anyone, I always mind my business and I always do what I want because I really don’t give a fu** about most people. I wanted to scatter everywhere and so far, I think I did just that, so if your existence has not shook the internet at any point in your miserable life, if all you do is sit in a god forsaken cubicle and hate on how people choose to live their lives, DO NOT SPEAK ON MY DRESS. “PS: The mission was not to win best dressed, but to bring Met Gala to AMVCA and I DID JUST THAT.” [sic].
