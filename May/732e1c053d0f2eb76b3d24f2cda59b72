Former Vice President of Nigeria, Abubakar Atiku, has said he is not afraid to speak on critical issues but that every tweet on his official social media handles must get his approval before publication. Atiku, one of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirants, said this when he paid a consultative visit to Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State at the Government House in Benin. Atiku had earlier condemned the gruesome killing of Miss Deborah Samuel who was accused of blasphemy. The post was soon taken down after a backlash against the former president by some Muslims on social media. According to Atiku, “Every tweet has to get my expressed approval but this one didn’t so I asked them to take it down. “I took a stand about Sharia law and was abused, thrown stones at, but how long did it last? Despite that, I didn’t change my position on that. I am not afraid to take a stand on critical issues,“ NAN quoted him as saying.
