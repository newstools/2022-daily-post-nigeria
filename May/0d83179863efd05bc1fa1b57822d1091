A Nigerian socio-political activist, Aisha Yesufu has said President Muhammadu Buhari lacks the constitutional power to sack the Central Bank Governor, Godwin Emefiele. Rumours making the rounds on social media indicate that the governor who had indicated an interest in contesting for president under the platform of the All Progressives Congress, APC has been sacked. DAILY POST has been unable to verify the rumour as of press time. Reacting to the rumoured reports, the Activist said the president may need to go through legislative processes before sacking the apex bank governor. In a tweet on her official Twitter handle, Aisha, however, said she would love the governor to be sacked over the alleged politicisation of his office. She wrote, “In as much as I would love @GodwinIEmefiele to be sacked for all his incompetence, failure and politicisation of his office, the President cannot SACK a CBN Governor! “There is a process and that process must be followed. It is called “Rule of Law”.
