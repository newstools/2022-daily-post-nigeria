Former Nigeria head coach, Christian Chukwu has warned the new handler of the team, Jose Peseiro, not to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, Gernot Rohr. Peseiro has been confirmed as the new permanent head coach of the Super Eagles. The Portuguese will now take charge during the upcoming international friendlies against Ecuador and Mexico. He will also prepare the three-time African champions for the 2023 AFCON qualifiers. During his time, Rohr rarely lived in Nigeria throughout the almost five and half years he was in charge of the Eagles. The 68-year-old Franco-German also did not reckon with players in the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL). “I’m very happy so that it does not delay our preparation for Nations Cup qualifiers and let’s see what he will do when he comes,” Chukwu told Brila FM about the hiring of Jose Peseiro “I will like him to live here, monitor our leagues and our players; let him not be like Rohr who stayed in Germany. Then days to the match, he will come back to the country with the players and so on. “I will like this one to stay in Nigeria if they have accommodation for him and everything and let’s see how it goes.”
