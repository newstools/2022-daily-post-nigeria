The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Thursday secured the conviction of ex-Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Labour and Productivity, Clement Illoh. Illoh was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment by Justice Babs Kuewumi of the Federal High Court in Ikoyi, Lagos. The former official was prosecuted by the EFCC on a three-count charge bordering on non-declaration of assets to the tune of N97.3million. The money was secretly warehoused in Account No 3033750243 domiciled with First Bank of Nigeria Ltd. The offence violated section 27(3) (C) of the EFCC (Establishment) Act 2004. The prosecution revealed that, among others, Illoh received N65million from SURE -P project contractors and kept it in his personal account. Defence counsel, T. S. Awana, sought the court’s permission to confer with his client, who applied to change his “not guilty” plea. Justice Kuewunmi granted the application and Illoh pleaded “guilty”. He said: “I have given attention to the allocutus of the defendant. However, the court will not fail to perform its duty in accordance with the provisions of the law. “The defendant is hereby sentenced to four years in each of the counts and the same shall run concurrently from the 10th of October 2019.” The judge ordered the forfeiture of the Illoh’s N97,300,613, $139,575 and £10,121 to the Nigerian government for “being proceeds of unlawful activities”
