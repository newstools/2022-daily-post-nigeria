A Kaduna Magistrates’ Court on Thursday ordered the remand of a 27-year-old man, Sunday Markus, who allegedly abducted and defiled a teenager. The Magistrate, Blessing Stephen, did not take Markus’ plea but ruled that he would be kept at a custodial centre pending advice from the state director of public prosecutions. She adjourned the case until June 28 for mention. Markus, a resident of Sarki Street, Kudenden in Kaduna, was charged with abduction and defilement. According to the prosecutor, Insp Sunday Baba, Markus committed the offences on April 30 at his residence. Baba alleged that Markus took the 16-year-old from her house to his residence and had sexual intercourse with her when her parents went for a church programme. “The suspect went to the girl’s room while she was sleeping, threatened to kill her if she shouted, dragged her into his vehicle and drove away to his house,” he submitted. The prosecutor said the girl’s parents reported the case at a police station after some neighbours called them on phone. The alleged offences contravene sections 283 and 253 of the Penal Law of Kaduna State, 2017.
