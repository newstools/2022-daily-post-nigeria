The All Progressives Congress (APC) has postponed its presidential primaries to June 6th and 7th. This decision comes only a few hours before the original date of the exercise, which was earlier slated for Sunday, May 29. APC’s announcement comes after the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) accepted appeals by political parties to extend the dates for the conduct of primary elections. INEC in a statement on Friday, extended the dates for primaries by six days. Earlier, political parties had requested for 37 to 60 days extension of the timeline for primaries and the nomination of candidates but the commission refused the plea.  More to follow..
