The Oluwo of Iwoland, Oba Abdulrosheed Adewale Akanbi, has disclosed why Yoruba political leaders would not be forgiven. Oluwo said Yoruba politicians like the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential aspirant, Bola Tinubu; Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, APC chieftain, Bisi Akande and South-West governors would not be forgiven “should they fail to brighten the political fortune of Yorubaland ahead of 2023 general elections.” He spoke while lamenting the division among Yoruba political leaders in the APC and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. The monarch stressed that the sharp division among Yoruba political leaders is a clear demonstration of disunity. In a statement by his Press Secretary, Alli Ibrahim, the monarch noted that the political future of the Yoruba race was in danger. According to Oluwo, “If Yorubas fail the 2023 poll, it will have a perennial touch on the future political fate of our race. “The handwriting on the wall is clear. We should bury our ego to move mountains. Missing the golden opportunity will be a collective failure. I’m hopeful the ball has not crossed the bar. “We need an urgent Yoruba political meeting. Only this, I think, can prevent us from dancing naked to the market place and come home barefooted. I appeal to all the stakeholders involved to prevent the rain of doom on the political fortune of Yorubaland by putting our house in order. It is not too late. But tomorrow may be.”
