Aston Villa manager, Steven Gerrard, has suggested that Paris Saint-Germain’s Kylian Mbappe could be regretting his decision to turn down Real Madrid. Recall that Mbappe recently opted to extend his stay with PSG, despite being heavily pursued by Real Madrid for quite some time. Real Madrid were the frontrunner to sign the France international this summer. But Mbappe decided against a move to the Santiago Bernabeu and signed a new deal with the Parisians till 2025. And Gerrard believes the Frenchman might already be ruing his decision. “He (Mbappe) is definitely thinking he is a little bit richer for sure! But from a football decision, I do think in his quiet moment tonight if he has watched that game [Liverpool vs Real Madrid], he will think to himself, ‘I have just turned down the chance to join a club that has won 14 European Cups’, and they’re going to be back because they recruit top players,” said Gerrard on BT Sport. He added: “They (Real Madrid) have got the know-how; they have got the demand to win it; they are going to win more. They have got the pull, have not they; they’ve got the pull worldwide. They are a giant in the game. “They have got the pull where recruitment-wise, if a club like Real Madrid comes along for you, 99 times out of 100, you go.”
