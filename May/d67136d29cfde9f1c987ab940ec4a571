The 18-year-old is closing in on 100 appearances for Dortmund since joining the Bundesliga club two years ago. Speaking on his future with Dortmund amid interest from Premier League clubs, Bellingham told Ruhr Nachrichten BVB, “The only future I think about is the next game for Dortmund. “I look forward to next season. I look forward to it starting again. But yes, I will be here next season and I will be ready.” He added, “I think a lot of the credit goes to the coaching staff and the staff who keep the noise around me. In this way, I can only focus on winning matches because that is what I am here for.”
