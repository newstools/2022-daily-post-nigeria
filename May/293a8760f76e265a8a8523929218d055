Former captain of Manchester United, Roy Keane, has slammed Marcus Rashford, accusing the England international of having ‘lost his hunger’ and being ‘left behind’ at the Theatre of Dreams. Keane said he is struggling to see a future for Rashford at the club after the 24-year-old was left on the bench for United’s 3-0 win against Brentford on Monday night. The Manchester United youth team product has managed just five goals in all competitions for the club this term, only two of which have come under Ralf Rangnick. Rashford is believed to be considering leaving Old Trafford but will wait to speak to new boss Erik ten Hag before deciding on that. “Rashford’s taken his eye off the ball with all the off-the-field stuff. “He doesn’t mix his game up enough, he doesn’t look like he’s matured. We’ve seen a few games recently where, even when he’s playing at Liverpool through the middle, he played like a child. “He’s not learned about the game. He’s just drifting. He’s lost the hunger – these young players get a lot of money and good luck to them but he’s lost the eye of the tiger and he’s struggling to get it back. “Wherever Man United want to go, Marcus has been left behind.”
