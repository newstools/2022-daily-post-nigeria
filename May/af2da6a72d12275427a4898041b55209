A 25-year-old class teacher at a primary school in Ago Iwoye area of Ogun State, Ayobami Oluwatobiloba Runsewe, has allegedly defiled a 13-year-old girl in his class. Runsewe was arrested Thursday following a report lodged at the Ago Iwoye police division by the minor’s mother. The mother had gone to the station with the victim to report how the teacher reportedly lured the pupil to his house in Ayegbami area of Ago Iwoye after an evening class at about 4:30pm. The teacher was said to have “forcefully had unlawful carnal knowledge of her.” The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said, “the blood-soaked pant of the victim was brought to the station as evidence.” Upon the report, Oyeyemi explained that the DPO of Ago Iwoye, SP Noah Adekanye, had detailed detectives to the scene, “where the randy teacher was promptly arrested.” “On interrogation, he initially denied having anything with the victim, but when the victim confronted him, he was unable to say anything further,” Oyeyemi disclosed. The Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole has since directed that the teacher be moved to the anti-human trafficking and child labour unit for further investigation.
