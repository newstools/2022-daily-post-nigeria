The Nigerian Army on Saturday said troops of 34 Brigade of the Nigerian Army and operatives of the Department of State Services dislodged a training camp of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its armed wing, Eastern Security Network (ESN) at Okporo in Orlu Local Government Area of Imo State. In a statement by Onyema Nwachukwu, Director, Army Public Relations, the troops exchanged fire with the outlawed group and killed two members on the wanted lists of security agencies. He said the suspects have been terrorising residents in the general area of Orlu, Orsu and Njaba. He said the troops equally destroyed the training shed and other facilities used by the separatists, including a shrine, which members of the outlawed group reportedly use for spiritual fortification. He said a local factory for fabricating weapons was also discovered and destroyed while three Dane guns, one locally fabricated pistol, one live round of 7.62mm, one live cartridge, two used shells of 7.62mm (special) and objects suspected to be charms, among other dangerous weapons were recovered.
