A popular socio-political activist and former federal lawmaker, Shehu Sani, has opined that the resignation of Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe from the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, is a setback. DAILY POST had reported that Abaribe, who dumped PDP on Friday, also resigned as the Minority Leader in the upper chamber of the National Assembly. He gave ‘illegality, impunity, and hesitations in decision-making’ as reasons for dumping the PDP. Reacting, Shehu Shani on Twitter wrote, ”Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe’s reported resignation from the PDP is a serious setback to the opposition. ”He is an outstanding lawmaker and a strong voice for justice, equity and accountable. It is unfortunate that the Abia issues couldn’t be solved amicably.”
