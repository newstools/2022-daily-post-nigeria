A three-time governorship candidate in Ogun State, Gboyega Isiaka; and a three-time member of the House of Representatives, Abiodun Akinlade; appear to have ceded the Ogun West senatorial ticket to Lagos West Senator, Olamilekan Adeola. Adeola had picked the nomination form of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to vie for the Ogun West senatorial seat, even while still representing Lagos West. This has since generated issues between Adeola and the likes of Isiaka and Akinlade, who also obtained the Ogun West senatorial forms under the same party. On different occasions, Isiaka had dragged Adeola, describing him as a non-indigene plotting to hijack what does not belong to him. DAILY POST recalls that elders in Ogun West went up in arms with one another over Adeola’s ambition. While a group of elders said the Senator was not qualified to contest in Ogun West, another set of elders insisted that Adeola must be allowed to contest for Yewa-Awori senatorial seat while still holding the mandate of Lagos West. But, a drama ensued at Friday’s APC House of Representatives primary when the duo of Isiaka and Akinlade, who were senatorial aspirants, were handed the tickets. Our correspondent reports that Isiaka was given the ticket of Egbado North and Imeko/Afon Federal Constituency, while Akinlade received that of Egbado South and Ipokia Federal Constituency. Inside sources said the duo had accepted to run for House of Representatives in order to clear the coast for Adeola, whom they once addressed as a ‘foreigner’. At the moment, the battle for the Ogun West seat is between the incumbent Senator Tolu Odebiyi and his colleague from Lagos State.
