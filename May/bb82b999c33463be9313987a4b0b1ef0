President Muhammadu Buhari has downplayed the possibility of having a preferred candidate for the 2023 Presidential election. Buhari said he has no favourite candidate for the 2023 Presidential election. He promised to hand over power to whoever Nigerians elect as his successor in 2023. Buhari spoke while fielding questions from journalists after observing the Eid-el-Fitr prayers in Abuja. Buhari said he has no special candidate to replace him next year. Instead, the President said the one who would succeed him is “the person that Nigerians elect”. The President also urged security agencies to redouble efforts in the fight against insecurity. “We’ll continue to make the environment secure, especially when the rainy season is coming, so that farmers can go back to their farms and we wouldn’t have problems of food security. “Heads of the services — army, navy, air force, the inspector-general of police, and so on — are very much aware of the situation. It’s their duty to know where the terrorists are and eliminate them,” he said.
