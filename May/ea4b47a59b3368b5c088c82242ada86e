Chukwudimeme Onwuamadike a.k.a. Evans has obeyed the order of an Ikeja Special Offences Court to get a new counsel. He is standing trial alongside Joseph Emeka for an alleged attempt to kidnap Young Shall Grow Chairman Motors, Vincent Obianodo. On Friday, Emmanuel Ochai, lawyer to Evans’ co-defendant in another case, held brief for Chuks Muoma (SAN), the new counsel. Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo had on March 11 ordered Evans to get a lawyer before the next court date or be ready to defend himself. Frank Udeme, one of the co-defendants was sentenced to five years imprisonment on March 11, after pleading guilty to selling firearms to Evans. The prosecution told the court that Evans and Emeka on August 27, 2013, at Third Avenue in Festac Town, Lagos, allegedly killed Ngozi Chijioke. They were accused of attempting to kidnap and kill Obianodo on the same day. The defendants pleaded not guilty to a seven-count charge of murder and attempted murder. Others are conspiracy to commit kidnapping, and attempt to kidnap, sale and transfer firearms. Justice Taiwo adjourned the case until June 15 for trial.
