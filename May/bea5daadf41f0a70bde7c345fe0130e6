Bayern Munich striker, Robert Lewandowski, is only interested in leaving the club for Barcelona this summer. This was confirmed by highly-respected Italian transfer expert, Fabrizio Romano. Romano tweeted on Saturday: “Robert Lewandowski has not changed his mind, as of today. “He wants Barcelona and he’s not even in talks with any other club – just waiting for Bayern to make a final decision and find a potential replacement. “Barça are always in direct contact with his agent Pini Zahavi.” Lewandowski has already informed Bayern he will not sign a new contract with the club. The Poland striker has one year left on his current deal.
