The Premier League will send officials to the last-day fixtures at Manchester City and Liverpool, the UK Mirror reports. Both teams could be crowned champions on Sunday, as City are only one point ahead of the Reds going into the final week. Premier League CEO, Richard Masters, will be in Manchester, while interim chairman Peter McCormick will be on Merseyside. A replica trophy will be with McCormick in Liverpool, as will 40 blank medals ready to be engraved. City will have the genuine article in their stadium, with plans for both the medals and trophy to be engraved with the correct clubs and names after the event. Plans are in place should either side come out victorious and will be given the same presentation, with a “community champion” handing the respective captain the silverware. Pep Guardiola’s men are strong favourites to get the job done. A win over Aston Villa at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, will ensure they win the trophy for the fourth time in five seasons. But should Pep Guardiola’s side slip up, Liverpool could be waiting to pounce, facing out-of-form Wolves at Anfield.
