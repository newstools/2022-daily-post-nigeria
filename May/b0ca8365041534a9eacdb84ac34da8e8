The Social Action Centre (SAC) Committee of the Catholic Church in Nigeria has appealed to Nigerians to consider competency as the only ingredient for electing leaders in the 2023 general elections. The spokesperson, Dame Mary Asibi Gonsum, warned Nigerians against the use of religious, ethnic and other affiliations in electing political leaders in the 2023 general elections, saying it would not augur well for the development of the country. The observation was made in a joint news conference in Abuja by the National Coordinator, SAC-Committee and National President, Catholic Women Organisation of Nigeria (CWON), Dame Mary Asibi Gonsum. She enjoined delegates of all political parties not to allow them be influenced by the choice of candidates in the coming General elections in the country with the amount given to them by aspirants. Her words, “We call on all political parties’ delegates to reject the influence of money in the choice of electing the party candidates and vote for credibility so that a handful of families or hidden interests will not bankroll our elections.”
