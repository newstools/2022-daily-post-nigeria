Liverpool have suffered another injury blow ahead of their Champions League final tie with Real Madrid on May 28. The Reds, however, have a few injury problems ahead of the Champions League final with Real Madrid in Paris. The likes of Fabinho, Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk all have issues and now, following last night’s Premier League tie with Southampton, there is more injury in Jurgen Klopp’s squad. Liverpool won the game against Southampton 2-1, but Joe Gomez sprained his left ankle just before half-time, according to Mundo Deportivo. Gomez is a serious doubt to be fit on time to play the final against the LaLiga champions later this month. Liverpool’s final game of the Premier League season is against Wolves on Sunday.
