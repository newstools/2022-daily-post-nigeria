Liverpool legend, Jamie Carragher, has slammed Manchester United, describing the European giants as a small club for bringing back Cristiano Ronaldo to the club. According to him, the move for Ronaldo was one that a ‘small club’ would make, adding it shows that the Premier League giants are getting their transfer very wrong. The Red Devils brought back Ronaldo on a three-year deal last summer, beating off competition from rivals Manchester City to the Portuguese signature. Ronaldo has gone on to score 24 goals in all competitions for the Red Devils this season but many believe he is United’s problem. “Manchester United are one of the super clubs of world football and I just look at the other ones in Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Barcelona – the ones that have won the Champions League,” Carragher told Sky Sports. “What would you do if you were ten Hag when you’ve got the biggest name in the world? Would Liverpool bring back Luis Suarez? I don’t think they would – even if he was going to get 20 goals. “They [United] should be bringing Haaland. Man City are bringing him in whereas United have got Ronaldo. “He’s a legend and one of the best goalscorers of all time but it almost made me think of Man United as a small club.”
