President Muhammadu Buhari has urged the World Bank, African Development Bank (AfDB) and other partners to support the One Planet Summit initiative. Buhari called for the activation of the fund pledged for land restoration, tree planting, development of climate resilience infrastructure and investments in small and medium sized farms. The President also underscored the importance of recharging Lake Chad, now down to 10 percent of its water volume. Buhari spoke on Monday at a side event at the ongoing UN Conference Of Parties (COP15). Eleven Sahel African states met in Abidjan to discuss ways of accessing and utilizing $19billion promised by donors for the activities of the Pan African Great Green Wall Agency (PAGGW). Buhari is the President of the Conference of Heads of State and Governments of the member states of the PAGGW. The Nigerian leader said the inter basin transfer of water from Central Africa to Lake Chad should be taken seriously. He charged the funders and soon-to-be appointed consultant to carry out measures to restore the socio-economy of the more than 30 million people of the Lake Chad basin area. Buhari lamented the drying up of Lake Chad which has destroyed fish farming, animal husbandry and crop agriculture, leading to social and economic dislocation with serious consequences for peace. This, according to him, has led to migration to Europe by many, creating problems for the countries. “Nigeria, Senegal, Niger, Sudan, Mauritania, Ethiopia, Mali, Eritrea, Djibouti, Burkina Faso and Chad are facing danger due to the devastating effect of desertification and drought. “There is, therefore, an urgent need to confront these challenges associated with desert encroachment and drought”, he added.
