The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, five-man delegates committee for the three-man ad-hoc delegates congress, has canceled the exercise in Anambra State. No new date has been fixed for the exercise which was to be held on Saturday, but later shifted to Sunday by the panel. The panel with Jibrin Ahmed as the Chairman and Ogbonna Victor Okorie as the Secretary, told the party’s stakeholders on Sunday that the cancellation was as a result of inability of the original result sheets for the congress. Despite shifting the congress to Sunday where they communicated with the stakeholders who assembled at the party secretariat at Udoka Housing Estate in Awka, the panel claimed they left the result sheets in their hotel, while they brought photocopies of the result sheets. Angered by the behaviour of the panel, the PDP stakeholders, who engaged them in a shouting match, held them hostage, and in the process, the panel agreed to cancel the congress.
