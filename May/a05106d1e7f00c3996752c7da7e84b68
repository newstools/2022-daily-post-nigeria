Former Leeds United goalkeeper, Paddy Kenny has urged Arsenal to sign Manchester City’s Gabriel Jesus this summer. Kenny believes Arteta wants Jesus and it makes a lot of sense because the Brazilian is a Premier League quality. Jesus has been linked with a move away from Man City this summer and Arsenal are among the clubs monitoring him with interest. Speaking to Football Insider, Kenny said that the north London side are the favourites for Jesus’ signature because Arteta worked with the player while he was an assistant coach at Manchester City. Kenny said, “It gives them an edge over other clubs. If [Mikel] Arteta wants him, then they clearly got on, and he clearly rates him. So I can’t see there being any issues there. Jesus has always put up good numbers, but he could probably get a few more goals if he’s the main man somewhere.” He added: “He is Premier League quality, and we know Arsenal need a striker, so it makes a lot of sense. They could easily sign him, in my opinion. I don’t know who else would be in for him.”
