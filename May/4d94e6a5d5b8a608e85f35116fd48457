Former Manchester United striker, Louis Saha, has told his countryman, Paul Pogba to join Chelsea instead of leaving English football as he reportedly plans to do. Saha advised Pogba to resist the temptation to rejoin Juventus and instead sign for Chelsea to enable him play alongside his national teammate, N’Golo Kante. Pogba appears to have played his final game for the Red Devils with his contract due to expire next month. Injury has kept the World Cup winner out of action since last month’s 4-0 defeat against Liverpool. But he has returned to training and in contention to feature in Sunday’s game at Crystal Palace. However, reports in England suggest that the Frenchman is considering pulling out of the game amid concerns about facing a backlash from Manchester United fans. Saha believes his compatriot will do better at Stamford Bridge “Chelsea is the obvious match for Pogba because he loves to play with N’Golo Kante,” Saha told Lord Ping. “We always try to compare what he does with France and United and the ability of Kante makes Pogba play to another dimension and that’s the truth. “Only Pogba can indicate where he wants to go. I’m just sad he hasn’t fulfilled his dream.”
