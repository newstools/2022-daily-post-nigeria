Renowned lawyer, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, has described the suit by Godwin Emefiele, on his eligibility to contest the 2023 presidency, as a comedy. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor filed the case at the Federal High Court in Abuja on Monday. The court however turned down his request for a restraining order against the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF). In a statement, Adegboruwa said by the decision of the Supreme Court in Akinlade vs INEC, there is no competent suit filed by Emefiele pending before the court for adjudication. He noted that the affidavit supporting the originating summons and the affidavit of urgency were deposed to by his counsel in flagrant violation of Rule 20 of Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC). The Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) said originating summons cannot be determined in the Federal High Court without a competent affidavit in support thereof. Being an employee of the CBN, the legal practitioner explained that any case to determine Emefiele’s status or eligibility should be filed at the National Industrial Court (NIC). Adegboruwa said as long as Emefiele earns salary from CBN, “he should not dream of contesting election while still holding on to his office. It is an insult to our collective psyche as a people”. “Sensitive election materials are always kept in CBN offices nationwide by INEC, unknown to Nigerians that Emefiele as Governor of CBN had been a politician all his life.” The SAN further observed that the All Progressives Congress (APC), which Emefiele seeks its presidential ticket, is not a party in his court case, contrary to extant laws and practice. He urged the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Election Situation Room, and civil society organizations to apply to join Emefiele’s case “and put an end to this joke”.
