Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp has insisted he does not need to speak with Aston Villa’s Steven Gerrard before their Premier League clash at Manchester City. The Reds are one point behind City with only one round of fixtures left, thanks to their 2-1 victory at Southampton on Tuesday night. However, Klopp has said he will not seek a favour from former Liverpool captain, Gerrard, who is Villa manager. He said: “If we become champions then it would be deserved as well but we have to win. “Whatever happens will happen because this is a pretty special group.” However, Klopp made it clear he would not speak to Villa boss Gerrard to wish him luck. “I don’t have to speak to him because Aston Villa will want to win for Aston Villa,” said Klopp. Klopp’s men have already won the FA Cup and Carabao Cup, but are still in the hunt for the Premier League and Champions League.
