The Zamfara State Government has suspended indefinitely the state delegates congress of the Nigeria Union of journalists (NUJ), saying that the decision was taken considering the constant insecurity situation ravaging the state. This was contained in a statement signed by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Information, Barrister Sani Nasaawa, on behalf of the commissioner, Hon. Ibrahim Magaji Dosara and made available to newsmen in Gusau, the state capital. The statement noted that the government had copied the national president of the Nigeria Union of journalists (NUJ), the state Commissioner of Police, state commandant, Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) and other security chiefs in the state. However, no date or time was given for readjustment of the delegates congress as the statement said the ministry was making consultations with security chiefs for a favourable date and time to conduct the election of the State council of Nigeria Union of journalists (NUJ). DAILY POST reports that the national secretariat of the union had earlier approved the state’s delegates congress and scheduled the date for Saturday, 14th May, 2022 but readjusted it for 12th May, 2022.
