Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal has shed more light on the circumstances leading to the gruesome murder of Deborah Samuel, a 200-level student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto State, who was burnt alive. Tambuwal said that contrary to a general belief, operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) tried but could not save the late Deborah, saying the mob overpowered the security agents. DAILY POST reports that Deborah was recently beaten to a pulp and burnt alive by Muslim students who accused her of insulting Prophet Muhammed via a group WhatsApp platform. “Contrary possibly to what you’re thinking, the security agencies, particularly the DSS, were able to get to the school on time and were actually able to get Deborah rescued from the mob initially,” Tambuwal told reporters on Friday as he visited Delta State to continue his 2023 presidential campaign. “As they were mobilising forces from the military barracks, the police command, the mob was growing. As we speak, one of the DSS agents that attempted to save her life is in the hospital with a broken head and the other one had a broken hand. “They were actually overpowered. It’s not as if she was left on her own. There was rescue by the DSS and they were around where she was locked into a room because they tried to really save her, but unfortunately they were overpowered.” Tambuwal also debunked reports that security operatives did not respond to the emergency situation in the institution.
