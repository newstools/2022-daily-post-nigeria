The crisis rocking the ruling All Progressive Congress, (APC) in Kogi State has taken a new twist as many party loyalists have begun to desert the party over the allegation of an anointed candidate. Some aspirants had allegedly accused the leadership of the APC of endorsing some aspirants who they say are in the good books of Governor Yahaya Bello. The APC, through the state Chairman Abdullahi Bello had, on the other hand, denied the allegation. The latest gale of defection is coming from a serving House of Representatives member, Idirissu Lawal who announced his defection from the APC to the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). DAILY POST gathered that the new romance of the serving lawmaker with NNPP is not unconnected with the information making the rounds that he is not among those allegedly pencilled down by Governor Bello to return to the National Assembly. Lawal, who represents Ajaokuta Federal Constituency in the lower chamber of the National Assembly, was elected into the House of Representatives in 2015 and won his re-election in 2019 on the platform of the APC. The two-term Rep member emerged candidate of the NNPP in a primary election conducted at the weekend and will seek a third term on the party’s platform in 2023.
