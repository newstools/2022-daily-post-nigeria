Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) has again complained of fuel scarcity, days after suspending flight shutdown. The body warned that the situation would worsen flight cancellations and delays in domestic operations. The spokesperson, Prof. Obiora Okonkwo issued a statement in Lagos on Monday. The AON said its members were trying to cope with the growing scarcity of the Jet A-1 petroleum product. “The scarcity is impacting negatively on the conduct of air transport operations and would lead to flight rescheduling or cancellations.” Okonkwo assured that carriers were working with fuel marketers, government and relevant stakeholders to ensure availability. The statement further pleaded with passengers for understanding of recent happenings in the sector. The AON promised that all necessary steps are being taken to restore normal flight schedules.
