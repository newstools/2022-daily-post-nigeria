Former Liverpool defender, Jose Enrique has slammed Everton’s Richarlison after the forward mocked the Reds following their Champions League final defeat to Real Madrid at the weekend. Richarlison was delighted with Liverpool losing the Champions League final against Real Madrid in Paris and tweeted a cheeky photo. Recall that Liverpool lost the Champions League final 1-0 on Saturday night to Real Madrid after Vinicius’ only goal of the match. And Richarlison, who plays for Liverpool’s arch-rivals Everton, was quick to mock Jurgen Klopp’s side on Twitter. But Enrique was not pleased with the Brazilian and took shots at him. Speaking with Genting Casino, Jose said: “Richarlison should look at himself. His team was nearly relegated and Everton spent even more than Liverpool in transfer fees. I believe he should look at his team and I see him and Gary Neville riling up fan.” He added: “I know Gary Neville does it with Jamie Carragher and I know he’s a legend for Man United, but Richarlison getting involved when he didn’t have the best season in the world, he should be worrying more about himself. He’s not clever for getting involved.”
