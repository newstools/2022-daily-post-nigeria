Popular Nigerian dancer, Korra Obidi has cried out for help after her estranged husband, Justin Dean allegedly stole her $5000. Recall that Justin Dean sued for divorce months ago, accusing Korra of being narcissistic, among other things. However, Korra, Saturday, on Facebook live, called out her ex for refusing to take care of their two children and for allegedly stealing from her. She said: “Mistakenly, I sent money to my joint account with Justin Dean. I transferred $5000 there, he emptied the account and has downright stolen from me. “We’re separated and he has stolen from me and my girls. This is daylight robbery. I’ve messaged him to return this money he stole and he gave some excuses, trying to accuse me of stealing his gold. “I don’t know what’s he’s talking about but he just stole $5000 from I and my girls, we have lawyers fees to pay, rent at this point, but he wants us to be homeless. “He’s stealing from me at this point and he’s not giving me money for food for the girls, I’m taking care of these girls by myself and he’s still stealing from us.” Korra threatened to expose reason for her divorce if her ex-husband failed to return her money within 24hrs, adding that she’s done keeping quiet. “I don’t want to be victimized and be treated lik a horse that is working for a slave master, I’m just trying to build a home for my girls. I don’t want to be victimized because this money was made from my businesses and promotions. “Last warning, silence was golden, now it is over. You have 24hrs to respond,” Korra to Justin Dean.
