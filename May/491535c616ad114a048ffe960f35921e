An explosion has killed many and injured several others at Sabon Gari Quarters of Kano State. Our correspondent who was at the scene of the unfortunate incident saw over five people being rescued from the rubble of the explosion. Although many people are trapped under the rubble of the affected house adjacent to a primary school, an eye-witness said he saw a young man walking on the road and suddenly something exploded whether on him or from the building. Neither the security officials nor the National Emergency Management Agency have made comments on the cause of the blast, but already several persons are reported dead while so many others are still trapped under the rubble of the exploded house. The Department of Security Service (DSS) boss in the state, Muhammad Alhassan; and the Police Commissioner, Samaila Shuaibu Diko, were both at the scene. Operatives of the military, Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) and others were also at the scene. The Kano State Government has denied that it was an attack on the school, insisting that it was an animal pet store that was destroyed in the explosion. Muhammad Garba, the state Commissioner for Information, said that the government is trying to ascertain the cause of the explosion as well as the level of damage and casualties.
