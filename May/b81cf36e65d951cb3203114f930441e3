Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has said he supports the agitation of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB. Wike made the remark while recalling that IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu once sang his praises. Appearing on Channels Television’s Politics Today, Wike said he supports IPOB’s agitation, but frowns against the group’s violent approach. He, however, urged the Federal Government to listen and discuss with IPOB over their agitation. According to the Presidential aspirant: “IPOB is not a threat to me, it’s because of the division in the country that we have the kind of agitation we have today. “There was a time IPOB was singing praises of Wike, Nnamdi Kanu was singing praises about Wike that he is our son. “There is nothing wrong in people agitating but all the Federal Government should do is listen to their agitations, talk with them; there is nothing wrong about that. “My problem came when they came to my state and burnt infrastructure like the courts, police stations, and I told them not to do that. “Whether anybody likes it or not, I support the agitation, I support that we should sit down and discuss the marginalization of the Southeast. “I’m a governor and I asked them, do you need to kill people in my area, destroy infrastructures put in place for you to know I’m with you? I said no; I won’t do that.”
