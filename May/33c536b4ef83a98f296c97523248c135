Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has threatened to take legal actions against the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC if the body fails to extend the deadline for voters registration. SERAP said this in a statement on its verified Twitter handle while reacting to the extension of party primary elections. Recall that the electoral body had on Friday, extended the deadline for political parties to conduct their primary elections by one week. The new deadline is expected to elapse on June 6. Reacting, SERAP urged INEC to extend the same gesture to voters’ registration to enable eligible Nigerians register for their Permanent Voter Cards, PVC. The tweet reads, “Following the extension of party primaries’ deadline by INEC, we call on the body to immediately extend voters’ registration exercise to ALSO give more time for Nigerians to exercise their rights. We’ll sue INEC if voters’ registration is not immediately extended”. DAILY POST reports that while online registration for the PVC may end on May 30, physical registration is expected to elapse in June.
