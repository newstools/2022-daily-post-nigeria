Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has said that the worst presidential aspirant jostling to contest in the forthcoming elections on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is better than the best aspirant on the platform of All Progressives Congress (APC). Makinde made this disclosure while speaking in Ibadan, the state capital. He spoke on Tuesday when he received former Senate President, Bukola Saraki. DAILY POST gathered that Saraki was in Ibadan to woo PDP delegates ahead of the forthcoming presidential primary of the party. Makinde, while speaking, said that he has no doubt that PDP would get its act right and present a presidential candidate that will win the presidency. He added that whoever emerges as the candidate of PDP would salvage the country from the throes of economic woes and insecurity. Makinde while speaking further maintained that the PDP convention is an avenue for the party to take a serious decision for itself and the country. Makinde, who described the former governor of Kwara State as a good presidential material, said that the least of the PDP presidential aspirants is better than the best APC has to offer. “Some believe that in PDP, the least of our aspirants is better than the best APC wants to offer. “In the next 10 days, we have to take a very serious decision for our party and the country as well. I don’t have any doubt that we will get it right this time around. “They say 24 hours is a long time in politics. So, we have to keep striving, pulling everybody together such that we are able to narrow the field and go to the presidential convention as a united family.”
