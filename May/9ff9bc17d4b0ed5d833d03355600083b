Brazil legend, Ronaldinho has suggested the player that should win the Ballon d’Or this year. Ronaldinho said he wants Real Madrid striker, Karim Benzema to win numerous individual accolades in the future, with the France international being the main favourite to get the 2022 Ballon d’Or. “I love [Karim] Benzema,” Ronaldinho told RMC Sport. “He is a player with enormous qualities. And that is not just today, it’s been going on for a long time. “This season, things are going very well for him. I hope he wins as many individual titles as possible.” Benzema has been brilliant for Real Madrid so far this season. The 34-year-old, who is getting better with age, has now scored 44 goals in all competitions for the LaLiga champions, surpassing his best previous total of 32 goals in the 2011/12 and 2020/21 seasons.
