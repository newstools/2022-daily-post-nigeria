A former Senate President and All Progressives Congress, APC, Presidential aspirant, Ken Nnamani has lashed out at those buying forms for Presidential aspirants. Nnamani claimed that most of those purchasing forms for Presidential aspirants couldn’t pay their rent. He described the trend where support groups purchase forms for Presidential aspirants as “a big lie”. Speaking with AriseTV yesterday, the former Senate President said the office of the President is a serious business does not require someone to be persuaded into occupying it. According to Nnamani: “Our history is replete with reluctant leaders. This concept of collecting forms by proxy — people who go and collect forms for someone. We are talking about serious business; leading a country as complicated and complex as Nigeria requires someone who is prepared for the primetime. It does not require somebody who is being persuaded to go. It means the person is not even ready. “The discussion so far as being on people for who shadow groups have gone to obtain forms and claim to have contributed money for somebody. But if you look at those buying forms for people, some of them appeared to be having difficulty paying their house rent. We are starting on a wrong footing –telling lies. Anybody who is serious about contesting should go and buy the form and not send people while claiming reluctance. “The shadowy group going about saying they are purchasing forms for people is a laughing situation. It’s a big lie, and it should be discouraged.” Some of the Presidential aspirants of APC had their forms purchased by support groups.
