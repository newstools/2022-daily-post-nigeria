Former Speaker of the Kano State House of Assembly and Chairman, House Committee on Pension, Kabiru Alhassan Rurum, has announced his defection from the All Progressives Congress (APC). This is even as Senator Barau Jibrin, a gubernatorial aspirant of the party in Kano denied decamping. Rurum, a gubernatorial aspirant in APC, told our correspondent on the phone that the way things are happening in the party shows that some people are hellbent on choosing their own candidates rather than allowing internal democracy to prevail. He said he had done all he could to ensure that a free, fair playing ground is allowed in the cause of party politicking but the powers that be in the party have prevented that. He added that it is unfair at this dispensation to deny Kano South the chance to produce the next governor, saying they have not gotten that chance since 1992. He said he is considering joining forces with Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso of the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP) to ensure that his South Senatorial District produces the next Governor of Kano State. This is coming as another speculation spread that Senator Barau Jibrin, also a gubernatorial aspirant of the APC, has left the party, a rumour that was quickly denied by the Senator. Jibrin said in a telephone interview that he remains in the party and he is not thinking of leaving anytime soon.
