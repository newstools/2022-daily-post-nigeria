Chairman of Cross River State Traditional Rulers’Council, Etinyin Edet Etim Okon has called on politicians in Nigeria not to set the country ablaze by their utterances, antics and brand of politics. He also advised the electorates to have the background knowledge of those they would like to vote before the main Election Day. The monarch spoke to journalists in Calabar during an interview, saying Nigeria is more precious than the individual interests of politicians. “I like to advise that the country is much more important than individuals’ political interests. And so, let me advise that politicians should refrain from utterances that can set the country ablaze. “Everything should follow due process and in accordance with our constitution which is the grand norm. Nigerians should vote for someone who is good mannered, with the capacity to create impact and ability to lead, and not those who are struggling for their selfish interest,” Etinyin Edet said. Edet also cautioned members of his council against making unguarded utterances and getting enmeshed in political controversy. He said during these tense times, as royal fathers they should not allow themselves be dragged by politicians into any controversies. He reacted to the alleged involvement of certain traditional rulers in a reported consensus meeting of some parties. According to him, monarchs across the State were too enlightened to get enmeshed in such controversial issues. He warned politicians against dragging Royal Fathers into partisan politics. He said: “Traditional Rulers should be isolated from partisan politics but not from politics. This is because he is a father to all. Any Royal father who indulges in the game politicians play does not know his onion. We do not indulge in partisan, parochial issues about consensus or any matter about their primary election.”
