Unknown gunmen on Wednesday killed a gateman while robbing some officials of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) who lodged at the Mabila Hotel in Ikorodu, Lagos State. SP Benjamin Hundeyin, Police spokesman for Lagos Command, who confirmed the incident to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) said that the JAMB officials had been relocated to a safe place. Hundeyin said, “One Prof Odunsi, an official of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) who lodged at the hotel was robbed of his two phones, one HP Laptop and N20,000 cash. “Similarly, two female officials of JAMB, who lodged at the hotel, were robbed of their phones and jewellery,” he said. The spokesman said the hoodlums shot the hotel’s gateman, simply identified as Peter, 40, who attempted to prevent them from escaping. He explained that the gateman was rushed to an undisclosed hospital where he later died, adding that the corpse had been deposited at the Ikorodu General Hospital mortuary. He said when the hoodlums sighted the police van coming, they all fled in a Lexus SUV. “The Commissioner of Police for Lagos State, CP Abiodun Alabi, has assured that no stone will be left unturned. He has ordered a serious manhunt for the suspects,” he said.
