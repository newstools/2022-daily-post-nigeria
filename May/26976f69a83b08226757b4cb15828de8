Liverpool star Mohamed Salah and captain, Jordan Henderson have said the Reds are motivated to beat Real Madrid in the Champions League final on Saturday. Salah had last month declared he would be out to seek revenge against Real Madrid following their defeat to the Spanish giants in 2018 when he was injured by Sagio Ramos during the final. The injury also affected Salah’s participation at the World Cup in Russia. “I’m very motivated after what happened with Madrid last time,” said Salah at Wednesday’s media briefing. “And, after what happened on Sunday, everyone is motivated to win the Champions League. Everybody is excited about it.” Speaking on another source of motivation for Liverpool, captain Henderson pointed to the narrow loss of the Premier League title to Manchester City on Sunday. Henderson said, “The mood is good, to be honest. The training was very good today and I can see the excitement in the lads. “We were disappointed with the outcome on Sunday, it was tough to take, but I couldn’t be more proud of the lads for this season.”
