Manchester United could cut loose at least 10 players this summer. According to the Manchester Evening News, Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic, Jesse Lingard, Juan Mata and Edinson Cavani will all leave, as they are all out of contract next month, as is fourth-choice goalkeeper Lee Grant. Last year, the club triggered the one-year option in the contracts of Mata, Cavani, Pogba and Lingard. Matic opted not to exercise the option of an extra year and confirmed his departure last month. At the academy level, goalkeeper Ondrej Mastny, full-back Reece Devine, midfielders Charlie Wellens and Connor Stanley, as well as forwards D’Mani Mellor and Mateo Mejia, are out of contract. United have one-year options included in the contracts of Mejia and Wellens, both 19, but it is unclear if either will be exercised. There is also uncertainty over if United will trigger the one-year extension in Dylan Levitt’s contract as he approaches the final month of his deal.
