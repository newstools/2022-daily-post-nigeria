The immediate past Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi has provided updates on the Abuja-Kaduna railway. DAILY POST recalls that the south end of the rail was destroyed recently by explosions occasioned by bandits and insurgents. The bandits also killed many passengers and abducted others for ransom, leading to operations being shut down. During his consultative meeting with delegates of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja on Tuesday night, Amaechi said, “We have put security in place so that those who will travel as soon as they (NRC) resumes (train service on Abuja-Kaduna rail line) on the 23rd will not have challenges. “We have agreed with the Air Force that they will over-fly the trains so that anybody they see trying to compromise the tracks, they will shoot. “People who have no business being on the track should stay away, because if they see anything suspicious, they will shoot.” Amaechi, who resigned his appointment as the Minister of Transportation on Monday, to enable him to focus on his presidential ambition, said the decisions on the rail line were reached before his resignation. Meanwhile, gunmen suspected to be terrorists, on Tuesday blocked Abuja-Kaduna road and kidnapped several travellers. Eyewitnesses said the operation lasted for more than an hour without the presence of security operatives.
