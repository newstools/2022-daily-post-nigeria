Liverpool ace Sadio Mane has jokingly responded to the threat Karim Benzema will pose in the UEFA Champions League final when both teams clash on Saturday night in Paris. Benzema has been in red-hot form this season, scoring 44 goals and registering 15 assists in 45 appearances for Real Madrid so far. The 34-year-old is being touted as the favourite for the 2022 Ballon d’Or for his impressive season. But Mane believes the France international will not be at the peak of his powers when he faces Liverpool on Saturday at the Stade de France. The Senegal international told GOAL, “He’s a good lad. A very good striker, one of the best in the world. “He shows it every time. But I think he won’t be the same player on Saturday and I expect it. After that, he can become Karim again.”
