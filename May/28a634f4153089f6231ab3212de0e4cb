Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh’s ex-lover, Prince Kpokpogri has cried out over the demolition of his house by the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA). Kpokpogri on Saturday took to his Instagram page to show Nigerians that his house worth N700 million was pulled down because he refused to sell it. He has, however, claimed that the decision to pull down his mansion was an act of oppression. Kpokpogiri alleged that his house was demolished because he refused to sell it to some ” powerful ” but unnamed individuals who had begged him to sell the property to them. He assured that he would fight fervently to get justice for the demolished building.
