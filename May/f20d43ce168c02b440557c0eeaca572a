The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has issued a salient warning to schools in the territory to desist from working with the Parents Teachers Association (PTA) to extort money from students and teachers through unauthorized projects. The FCTA also warned that it’s illegal for schools to hide behind special initiatives to place undue difficulties on parents and guardians by collecting illegal fees. Dahir El-Katuzu, FCTA Secretary for Education Secretariat, gave the warning during a school resumption inspection at Kubwa Government Secondary School. FCTA has a standard that must be upheld in all schools and any school that breaks the regulations will be sanctioned, El-Katuzu hinted. The Secretary noted that school resumption inspection had been sustained by the secretariat, as a measure to keep both teachers, pupils and students in proper check. According to him, the Secretariat will continue to demonstrate the value it attaches to Education. Meanwhile, the PTA Chairman of Government Science Secondary School, Pyakasa-Maitama, Chidi Oparauwokè, pledged that the Association will remain committed to the policies of the administration while promoting the ideals of education. Similarly, the Principal, Government Secondary School, Kubwa, Musa Zuru said his school has recorded almost 80% attendance within the first two days of resumption. Zuru noted that his school has a set of standards that can’t be compromised. The Schools inspected include GSS Pyakasa-Maitama, and in Kubwa, the Government Junior Secondary school, Phase III, Kubwa, GSS Kubwa and a private school, Unity High school were visited.
