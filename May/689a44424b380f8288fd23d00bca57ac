The Actors Guild of Nigeria, AGN, has reacted to rumours about the health status of actress, Genevieve Nnaji. The star actress with about 8.5m followers on Instagram deleted her pictures and video on the platform after she shared some cryptic messages. This has raised concerns about her safety. Reacting to the development, the President of the AGN, Emeka Rolland, told NAN that he was not aware of Genevieve’s exit on Instagram. “I will have to reach out to her since I am just getting this news from you now. I have not learnt of that. ”I’ll reach out to her to know whether she is safe or not after your call. I cannot just conclude with hearsay or rumour,” he said.
