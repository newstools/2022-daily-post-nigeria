The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Kaduna State chapter, has urged pastors and church leaders to appeal to their members to remain peaceful, law-abiding and refrain from any act of lawlessness, and apply emotional intelligence in the face of challenge and provocation. A statement issued by the Secretary of CAN, Kaduna State, Rev Ma’aji Caleb, said, “I have directed to write and appeal to our Amiable Pastors and Church Leaders to continue to use our God-given roles and Revered pulpits to appeal to our Members to remain peaceful and law-abiding as we are always known. We are blessed because we are always known for peaceful coexistence (Matthew 5:9).” The statement urged Christians to refrain from any act of lawlessness, and apply emotional intelligence in the face of challenge and provocation. “I on behalf of the State CAN Chairman request us to pray for the repose of the soul of our sister Deborah Samuel who was gruesomely murdered by her senseless, inhuman and irreligious perpetrators,” the statement stressed. CAN called on the security agencies to work assiduously to apprehend and prosecute those responsible to ensure due justice is done without fear and favour. It, therefore, strongly condemned what it called “this heinous crime against the creator and humanity” and pray for the peace of Kaduna State/Nigeria and grant the political leaders the sincere political will to be fair, just and equitable to all the citizenry.
