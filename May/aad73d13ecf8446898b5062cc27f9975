The Ohanaeze Youth Council, OYC, has denied endorsing Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, for the presidency. OYC National President, Igboayaka O. Igboayaka, warned Tinubu to be careful of maligning the aspiration of the Southeast to produce Nigeria’s president. Igboayaka warned the APC presidential aspirant to keep his money because OYC would not compromise its stance on Igbo presidency. He was reacting to reports that a self-acclaimed OYC leader, Miracle Nwosu, endorsed Tinubu’s candidacy for the Presidency. However, OYC distanced itself from the purported endorsement of Tinubu’s candidacy. A statement by Igboayaka reads partly: “If Mr. Miracle Nwosu is a man, let him identify who he is, tell us where he’s living, tell us his village if he is a man. We are using this opportunity to warn any politician that wants to use Ohanaeze Youth Council’s name to cajole Ohanaeze Youth Council in the name of endorsing any political presidential aspirants in 2023 that is not from South East Zone. “It’s better that Tinubu keeps his money because his money cannot change the minds of the Igbo youths thereby compromising this project. “Mr. Bola Tinubu should be very careful; we are warning Ahmed Bola Tinubu and his presidential team to be very very careful in trying to do anything that will malign the interest of Southeast in the 2023 presidential project. “The Ohanaeze Youth Council, under the leadership of Comrade Igboayaka O. Igboayaka is 100% determined to actualize the Nigerian president of Southeast extraction by 2023. This project is timely and cannot be equated, sub-changed, or changed with anything, either it is South East presidency 2023 or Southeast ceases to be part of Nigeria.”
