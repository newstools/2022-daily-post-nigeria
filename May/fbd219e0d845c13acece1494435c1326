Abdullahi Adamu, the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has said that God will deal with people peddling the rumours of a third-term agenda for President Muhammadu Buhari. He said this while debunking insinuations that a large number of APC’s presidential aspirants was a subtle ploy to extend the tenure of Buhari in office. Adamu said this in an interview with select Hausa service media organisations late Wednesday night, according to NAN. Recall that President Buhari had on many occasions said he cannot wait to hand over to the next President of Nigeria and depart for his hometown in Daura, Katsina State. “I can only say that God will deal with those behind such insinuations,” Adamu told Hausa journalists. “President Buhari had since 2019 declared that he would not seek a tenure extension. “He told everybody and swore with the Qur’an that he would not breach constitutional provision on his two terms tenure. “The issue does not even arise, the president, while performing the Lesser Hajj reiterated this position. “If there is truth in such talks, none of the aspirants would have procured the party’s Expression of Interest and Nomination forms,” he said. The APC presidential primary comes up in Abuja between Sunday and Monday, May 29-30th, with 28 aspirants, according to the party Chairman, fighting for the ruling party’s sole ticket.
