Former Chelsea defender, Frank Sinclair, has slammed manager Thomas Tuchel’s decision to snub Romelu Lukaku against Everton; Sinclair said it was nonsensical for Tuchel not to feature Lukaku, who has scored many goals in the past, against Everton on Sunday at Goodison Park. Recall that Lukaku was an unused substitute as Everton defeated Chelsea 1-0, thanks to Richarlison’s only goal of the match. “Regarding Romelu Lukaku, there’s a massive problem there. For me, with ten minutes to go in a game that you need a goal and you have got a player who has scored so many goals and so many good feelings at this football club, for me it was nonsensical not to bring him on and give him 10 or 15 minutes to try and change the game and get something out of it,” Sinclair told Stadium Astro. “Especially when you are getting crosses in the box at will really towards the end when you are chasing the game. To leave him on the bench, I was quite surprised with. “They have obviously put a lot of money into bringing him back to the football club again, but I don’t like the body language. There was one performance, in particular, a few weeks ago that he got a lot of stick about just his overall effort and application in the game. I don’t like that. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see him go, but I think obviously Chelsea will want to recoup a lot of the money. For him, it would be more suited to go back to the likes of Inter where he enjoyed his football where he scored goals.”
