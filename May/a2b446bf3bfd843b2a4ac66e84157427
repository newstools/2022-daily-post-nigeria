Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti, has said he doesn’t want another comeback in Saturday’s Champions League final against Liverpool. The LaLiga champions have been involved in three dramatic come-from-behind to win matches enroute to the final. Madrid saw off Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Manchester City in the previous rounds, after looking on the verge of elimination. However, Ancelotti does not want a similar situation against Liverpool in Paris. “No, we don’t want another comeback. Hopefully Liverpool will try to come back,” he joked at Real Madrid’s training camp in Valdebebas. When asked about his worst moments before a final, Ancelotti said: “The three hours before the game are bad: the stress, the sweating, the negative thoughts. ”I have suffered this season more than most and there are no pills you can take, you just have to bear it.”
