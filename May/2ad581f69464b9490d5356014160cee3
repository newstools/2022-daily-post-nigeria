Erling Haaland has undergone his medical with Manchester City ahead of a summer move from Borussia Dortmund. This was confirmed by respected transfer expert, Fabrizio Romano, on his Twitter page on Monday. He wrote: “Erling Haaland to Manchester City, here we go! Haaland has passed medical tests as a new Man City player today, he’s back in Dortmund. It will be OFFICIAL this week. “Man City told BVB board that they will activate release clause [closer to €60m than €75m] in few hours.” Romano also claimed that Haaland will earn a weekly salary similar to what Kevin De Bruyne takes home at the Etihad. “Despite rumours, Erling Haaland’s salary agreed with Manchester City won’t go beyond the level agreed with Kevin De Bruyne, now worth around £375,000 per week. “Haaland will sign with Man City until June 2027 – so he’s not gonna break City salary structure,” Romano added.
