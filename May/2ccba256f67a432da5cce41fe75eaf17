A suspected armed robber has tendered his father’s full names instead of his at the police station after being arrested for robbery in Bayelsa State. The 28-year-old suspect, who was paraded by the State’s Police command, along with his partner, gave his name as Zion Kientei. DAILY POST had reported that operatives of the Bayelsa State Police Command arrested two suspected armed robbers and recovered a Barretta pistol in their possession. A statement signed by the State’s Police Public Relations Officer, SP Asinim Butswat noted that “The suspects: one Zion Kientei ‘m’ 28 years and one Solomon Deizigha ‘m’ 29 years were arrested inside a Tricycle with MOT Number 7501, during a stop and search operations at the Isaac Boro Express Way, Yenagoa, on 22 May, 2022 at about 2140 hours.” After the report, the father of the suspected criminal took to his Facebook page with a disclaimer that “there has been a radio announcement about a robbery suspect named Zion Kientei, aged 28. “My name is Zion Kientei, and I am 51 years of age. The suspect in question has been arrested and is in police custody. I am a law abiding and responsible citizen of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “Comrades, colleagues, and family members and the general public should take note of the disclaimer done in good faith.” However, he didn’t mention that the suspect was his son or relative. But, an independent investigation by DAILY POST, revealed that the suspect’s real name is MacNell Kientei. A close family source stated that “the boy is simply destroying his father’s name deliberately. “He is married with two children and living on his own. He should be responsible for his action. “The boy is simply being mischievous.”
