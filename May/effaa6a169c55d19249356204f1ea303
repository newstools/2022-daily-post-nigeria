The Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, has directed all churches across the country and Christian stakeholders to embark on a peaceful nationwide protest over the lynching of Deborah Samuel, a 200-level student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto State. DAILY POST reports that there have been tension in many parts of the country following the gruesome murder of the Christian student, who was burnt alive over alleged insult on Prophet Muhammed. Recall that pandemonium broke out in some parts of Sokoto State on Saturday following protest by Muslim men who violently protested the arrest of alleged killers of Deborah. The protesters, who were demanding for the immediate release of the suspects, destroyed some churches, shops and other properties belonging to Christians. A circular released on Saturday night by CAN’s General Secretary, Joseph Daramola, said the protest would be organized by churches across the country to demand justice for the deceased. “The protest will take place on 22 May, 2022 in the afternoon by 3pm in every secretariat of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) nationwide and not on the streets in order to avoid further loss of lives. “We urge those who could afford it to make use of the traditional media and social media to give it wide coverage in order to sensitise the whole world. We also call on Nigerian Christians in the diaspora to join us using our embassies all over the world. “The occasion can also be used to pray for Deborah’s family and friends, peace for the country, victory for the Church and godly political leaders in the coming general election. Thanks, and God bless you all,” the Church organization said. The circular directed Christians to hold placards with some succinct messages like “WE DEMAND JUSTICE FOR DEBORAH;
CHRISTIANS ARE NOT SECOND CLASS CITIZENS; NO MORE KILLING IN GOD’S NAME; ENOUGH IS ENOUGH; POLICE, STOP UNPROVOKED KILLINGS IN NIGERIA.”
