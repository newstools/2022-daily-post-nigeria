Paris Saint-Germain star, Lionel Messi, has said he has “no doubts” that Real Madrid captain, Karim Benzema, should win the Ballon d’Or this year. Messi spent most of his career at Barcelona going head-to-head with Benzema in La Liga. He has now tipped the France striker, who led Madrid to their 14th Champions League title last weekend, to win the Ballon d’Or. “I think there are no doubts Benzema should win the Ballon d’Or. “It is very clear that Benzema had a spectacular year and ended up elevating himself with the Champions League, being essential from the last 16 onwards in all the games. I think there are no doubts this year,” Messi told TyC Sports. Benzema netted 15 goals in the Champions League, including the winners in the knockout rounds against PSG, Chelsea and Manchester City. He also scored 27 goals and 12 assists as Los Blancos won the LaLiga title.
