Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah have been told to leave Liverpool if the club fail to meet their demands. Aston Villa legend, Gabriel Agbonlahor, wonders why Liverpool are finding it difficult to tie up the two African stars while players they are far better than are receiving the same pay at other clubs. He argued that if Kevin de Bruyne is getting a new deal and higher pay at Manchester City, who are also ready to pay new signing Erling Haaland his fat wages, and even Jadon Sancho at Manchester United then Mane and Salah deserve more. He told talkSPORT, “They’re going to want their value, Salah and Mane, and if Liverpool aren’t willing to give them that… “If you don’t, they’ll move on and that’s what Mane’s probably thinking. “Why should they stay?” Salah and Mane have scored more than 275 goals for Liverpool between them but are facing an uncertain future at the club with their respective contracts set to expire next summer. Mane could be set to play his last match for Liverpool in the Champions League final as the 31-year-old has been heavily linked with a summer move to Bayern Munich.
