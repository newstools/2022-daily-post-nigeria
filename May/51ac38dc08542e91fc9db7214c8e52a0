Three persons were on Saturday arrested by the police for allegedly attacking and robbing a company in Ogijo, Sagamu Local Government Area of Ogun State. The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, identified the suspects as Shadrach Blessing (25 years), Edibo Peter (25 years) and Osuawgu Oyebuchi (27 years). Oyeyemi said their arrest followed a distress call received by policemen at Ogijo divisional headquarters that some suspected armed robbers had invaded one Ruthfort Service Limited along the Ikorodu-Sagamu road in Ogijo. The PPRO disclosed on Sunday that the suspects had scaled the fence to gain access into the company at about 2:45 am. According to him, the armed men pointed a gun at the security guard, after cutting the security wire, ordering the guard to lie face-down “while they removed four industrial batteries.” “On receiving the distress call, the DPO of Ogijo division, CSP Onatufeh Umoh, quickly led his patrol team to the scene where the robbers who have already escaped to the street were chased in collaboration with members of public and apprehended three amongst them, while others escaped,” DAILY POST learnt. Oyeyemi hinted that the four industrial batteries were recovered from the men, adding that Ogun Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, ordered that the suspects be transferred to the state CIID for discreet investigation.
