Ukraine President, Volodymyr Zelensky has revealed the only way the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine will end. Ukraine and Russia have been fighting for close to three months and many casualties have already been recorded due to the war. Russian President, Vladimir Putin, in February this year, ordered the invasion of Ukraine because of some political differences between both neighbouring countries. Speaking in an interview that was recorded on Friday and broadcasted on Saturday, Zelensky said the war in Ukraine could only be resolved through ‘diplomacy’. This comes less than 24 hours after Zelensky slammed Russia for their airstrikes that destroyed the House of Culture in the Ukrainian city of Lazova in the Kharkiv region. “Ukraine will battle to a bloody victory, but the Russian invasion will end with diplomacy,” Zelensky said in a TV interview to mark his third anniversary as President. “We did not start this war. But we have to finish it.”
