Real Madrid midfielder, Luka Modric, has admitted the game against Manchester City was the most difficult. Modric was part of some incredible comebacks the LaLiga team pulled off this season. However, the Croatian midfielder has picked out the Champions League semi-final against City as the toughest. “The most difficult one was the one against Manchester City because there was almost no time left. “But the team and the fans believed until the end because it’s part of the DNA of this club. “In the end we did it. The most fun was the PSG game. “It was the start of many magical nights that have taken us all the way to Paris, and hopefully we can win another Champions League,” Modric said.
