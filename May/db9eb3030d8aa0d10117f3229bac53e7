Chelsea are looking to complete the signing of Jules Kounde from Sevilla, as soon as Ted Boehly’s £4.25bn takeover is formalized and UK government sanctions end, SportingLife reports. With several defenders leaving Stamford Bridge this summer, the Premier League side want to finalize the transfer quickly. The Blues reportedly reached an agreement last year to bring Kounde to the club. However, the move fell through over the fee Sevilla were demanding and the late timing of the discussions. Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has already assured fans that potential new owner Boehly is committed to making the team “competitive”.
