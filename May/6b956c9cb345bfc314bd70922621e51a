A governorship aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Benue State, Michael Kaase Aondoakaa, has defiled the zoning by the leadership of the party in the state and gone ahead to purchase the nomination and expression of interest forms to contest in the 2023 general elections. The former Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), stormed Makurdi, the Benue State Capital, Wednesday, after purchasing the governorship nomination forms from the national secretariat of party in Abuja. His move confirms earlier reports that he has defied the decision taken by leader of Benue APC, Senator George Akume, that the governorship ticket of the party be zoned to Jechira intermediate area. Aondoakaa hails from Kwande intermediate area, and was not favoured by the zoning decision of the party’s leadership. But it appears the former AGF has boycotted the Benue APC’s zoning arrangement and has gone to purchase the Governorship nomination forms. Sources disclose that such defiance by APC governorship aspirants in Benue of Akume has emerged to be a source of serious concern as it portends grave crisis in the party ahead of its governorship primaries. There are also speculations that, with the indirect mode of primaries stipulated for the party to the 2023 elections, big money bags, like Aondoakaa, are very likely to muscle their way through to victory against Akume’s wish. It was learnt that the situation has raised deep worries within the Akume camp as to where the “humongous amount of finances needed to prosecute the primaries will be sourced from”.
