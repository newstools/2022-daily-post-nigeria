Manchester City’s Phil Foden has won the Premier League Young Player of the Year award. The 21-year-old took the prize home for the second season in a row. Foden has played a crucial part for the champions as they look to retain the Premier League title on Sunday. The England midfielder has matched his goal contribution return of last season with nine goals and five assists to his name. His fine form was enough to see off a host of England team-mates including Liverpool star Trent Alexander-Arnold, Chelsea’s Mason Mount and West Ham midfielder Declan Rice. Also making the shortlist were Arsenal pair, Aaron Ramsdale and Bukayo Saka, and Crystal Palace duo Conor Gallagher and Tyrick Mitchell.
