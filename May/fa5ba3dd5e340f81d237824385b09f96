Outgoing Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick has questioned the club’s board over their failure to replace midfielder Nemanja Matic and their decision to spend big on Donny van de Beek, Amad Diallo and Facundo Pellistri. According to the Athletic, Rangnick questioned why a replacement signing for Matic has not been made, despite knowing that the former Chelsea star will be leaving Old Trafford when his contract expires at the end of the season. The German is also understood to have been confused by Man United’s decision to spend around £90 million for Diallo, Pellistri and Van de Beek instead of bringing in a proven player who would immediately secure a regular role in the team. Recall that Amad, Pellistri and Van de Beek, who were signed in 2020, have all been loaned out by Man United this season. Meanwhile, Rangnick took charge of his final game at Man United on Sunday as they were beaten 1-0 against Crystal Palace in the Premier League final day tie at Selhurst Park. Rangnick will be replaced by Erik ten Hag, who watched Man United’s defeat to Palace. Man United will now play in next season’s Europa League after West Ham’s 3-1 loss against Brighton.
