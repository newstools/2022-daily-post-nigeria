The Chairman of the opposition PDP in Cross River State, Venatius Ikem has indicated that the party may likely go for a consensus candidate for next year’s governorship election. In an interview with DAILY POST, Ikem said, “PDP is working towards a transparent, rancour-free and fair primary election. “If a consensus arrangement comes along the way, we will thank God for it.” Ikem also remarked on the aspiration of the Senator representing Cross River central, Prof Sandy Onor whose emergence reportedly angered stakeholders in the Southern District since they believe it is their turn to produce the next governor. “It’s not possible for anyone’s ambition to please everyone even in his family.” The chairman added that all other aspirants had quality and were marketable individuals. “All PDP aspirants are doing great in the field and I can assure you that all of them have support across the length and breadth of the state. “That’s what contesting can do for a political party. It also unifies people outside the boundaries of ethnic and geographical cleavages.” Still, on the quality of their aspirants, Ikem said the ward congresses which were held a few days ago had almost all aspirants claiming victory. Expressing happiness, he said the ward congresses were fair enough so that almost all stakeholders accepted the outcome.
