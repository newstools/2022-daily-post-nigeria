Liverpool legend Steve Nicol has slammed manager Jurgen Klopp for his complaints regarding his team’s fixture list this season. Liverpool’s injury list is growing with every game and their victory over Southampton on Tuesday was their 61st fixture of the season, as they have reached the final of every competition they have competed in. Klopp has consistently complained about UEFA and the Premier League’s scheduling. The Mirror reported that the German once again took a dig at the governing bodies as they faced Southampton just three days after their FA Cup final victory over Chelsea, which went all the way to penalties. Liverpool kept their quadruple hopes alive by beating Southampton 2-1, despite Klopp making nine changes for the game at St. Mary’s. However, Nicol said Klopp is not a special case because Liverpool are doing well this season, adding that the Reds boss should take the Southampton job if he didn’t want the pressure to compete on all fronts. “Jurgen, your next job, take the Southampton job and then you won’t have to worry about complaining about fixtures,” Nicol told ESPN. “Come on. Does he really want to turn round and ask the FA to help Liverpool?” “You would hear every other man and his dog complaining that they are going out of their way. Look, if you are as good as they are and as successful as they are, you are going to have a heavy schedule.” Nicol added: “He’s saying nothing that successful teams’ managers have not been saying since I was playing in the 80s. “It was the exact same in the 80s. You are not a special case because you do well, you should not expect anybody to look after you, so I don’t know why you are complaining.”
