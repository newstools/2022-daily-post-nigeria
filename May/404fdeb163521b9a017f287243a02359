Alex Ajipe, an All Progressives Congress, APC, a senatorial aspirant for Ondo North, has rejected the outcome of the primary that led to the emergence of the party’s candidate, Jide Ipinsagba. Ajipe, who frowned at the process that produced Ipinsagba, urged the party to cancel the election and hold a new one in the best interests of all aspirants. While speaking to newsmen in Akure, the capital of Ondo State, Ajipe branded the process as a parody of what a normal primary election should be. In the primary, Ajipe polled 57 votes while Ipinsagba won with a total of 268 votes. The aspirant said that the primary election was marred by irregularities and malpractices, claiming that the party’s leadership denied three of the four hopefuls access to the delegates’ lists and then modified the lists at the last minute. Strange market ladies and traders were presented to them as delegates, according to Chief Ajipe, a circumstance he described as ludicrous to a democratic process. He, however, announced his willingness to go before the party’s appeal tribunal to seek restitution.
