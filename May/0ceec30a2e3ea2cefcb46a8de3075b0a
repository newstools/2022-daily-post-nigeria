Nigerian singer activist Charles Oputa, aka Charly Boy has strongly condemned jungle justice that occurred in parts of the country. Charly Boy made the condemnation while leading a protest against the murder of Deborah Samuel, a female student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, gruesomely killed for alleged blasphemy. Calling for urgent measures by the government to tackle jungle justice in Nigeria, the Singer said, ”We can’t pretend that our sensibilities have not been assaulted by so much bloodletting happening all over our country.  ”If poverty, hopelessness, hunger and the indiscriminate killings of our sons and daughter can not unite us, what will?” The President of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Reverend Samson Ayokunle, had on Sunday, said the Christian body will not rest without adequate justice for the murder of Deborah Samuel. According to him, the body is making every move to ensure that the perpetrators of the deadly act do not go unpunished.
