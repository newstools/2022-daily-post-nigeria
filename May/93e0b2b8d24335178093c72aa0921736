The Social Democratic Party (SDP) is to hold its national convention from 28th to 30th May, 2022. Chief Supo Shonibare, the party’s acting National Chairman, made the disclosure in Abuja on Thursday, while briefing newsmen. According to the Acting National chairman, 19th May, 2022 has been slated for the ward and local government congresses of the party, while 20th May, 2022, would witness the State congresses.
