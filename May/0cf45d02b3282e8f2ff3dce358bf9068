Former Tottenham player, Jamie O’Hara has backed Spurs to finish in the top four position ahead of Arsenal. O’Hara feels Arsenal will ‘crumble’ in the top four race if they lose tonight’s crucial north London derby against Antonio Conte’s side. Arsenal currently sits in the fourth position on the Premier League table with four points ahead of Tottenham, who are in the fifth position. “I think it’s a huge pressurized situation for both teams and it will be about who handles that better,” O’Hara told Sportsmail. “Who’s got the experience? Who’s got the tactical nous and who’s got the cool heads in the fire pit? Because the atmosphere is going to be electric, absolutely electric. “I’ve played in north London derbies – you have got to be composed, you can’t make stupid mistakes, you can’t be a rabbit in the headlights, and the team who handles that best will win the game. “I think the pressure is going to mount on Arsenal. It’s a young squad of players and this is a massive game for them. We’ve got a bit more experience with Hugo Lloris, [Pierre-Emile] Hojbjerg, [Harry] Kane and [Eric] Dier. We are better equipped to handle the pressure. It’s really evenly matched but with the players we’ve got, we have got enough to beat them. “They have got better full backs than us, we have a better forward line. The midfield is close and centre backs are close too. The difference we have is we have Kane and Son – they don’t have that. “They [Arsenal] will crumble. If we win, they will fall apart,” he added. “I’m telling you, they will lose another one or draw, and they will miss out. “They have got Newcastle away – that’s no easy fixture – and Everton are fighting. We win this game, I think Arsenal will drop points. Our fixtures, we should go on and win them,” he added.
