Former Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, has hailed the mentality of Liverpool duo Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane. Wenger was speaking to beIN Sports, after the Reds defeated Villarreal 3-2 on Tuesday night, to qualify for the Champions League final. Salah has scored 30 goals in 46 appearances for the Reds this season, while Mane has netted 21 times in the same number of games. The duo have also recorded 18 assists between them. “Look at Salah and Sadio, who played in the Africa Nations Cup final. What they have done since they have come back, it’s monstrous. “We would have complained in Europe that we played too many games – never a word. Tonight, Mane has been kicked all over the place, never a word,” Wenger said.
