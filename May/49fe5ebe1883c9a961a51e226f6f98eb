The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has alleged that funds are being withdrawn from Ministries, Agencies and Parastatals of government by serving appointees of President Muhammadu Buhari to purchase the All Progressives Congress (APC) 2023 presidential nomination forms. PDP also accused the Presidency of allegedly allowing the mass looting of public funds to corruptly create a war chest for the APC in the 2023 general elections. The party in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Hon Debo Ologunagba, Tuesday, disclosed that “Our party has information of how public funds are being withdrawn from Ministries, Agencies and Parastatals of government and diverted to people who have no verifiable means of livelihood to purchase APC’s Presidential Nomination and Expression of Interest forms for individuals without any electoral value and who cannot even win local government elections. The statement partly read “We have intelligence on how public funds are pulled out of government Agencies in a surreptitious design perfected by an APC leader in connivance with certain individuals in positions of authority close to top persons in the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). “Nigerians will recall that the PDP had earlier alerted on how the CBN under Mr Godwin Emefiele as CBN Governor has been turned into the finance department of the APC where APC leaders fraudulently access public funds through nebulous subsidies, shady intervention programmes and discriminatory exchange policies which perpetuate illegal arbitrage system “The rejected APC has resorted to this underhand method to corruptly rake in billions of naira from the public treasury without consideration for the welfare of Nigerians.” PDP explained that the APC Is allegedly diverting public funds having realised that its leaders cannot make huge donations to the party coffers as they will be violating the limits of contribution to political parties as stipulated by law and regulation. It described as regrettable that the APC has extended their alleged corruption to the country’s electoral process not minding the consequential effect on the democratic system. The major opposition party insisted that nothing can prevent the imminent crushing defeat of the APC at the polls in 2023. PDP called on the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Accountant General of the Federation as well as the Auditor General of the Federation to immediately commence an investigation and monitor the movement of funds in Ministries, Department and Agencies of government to protect Nigeria’s treasury from the APC ahead of the 2023 general elections.
