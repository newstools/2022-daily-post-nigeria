Former Liverpool star, John Barnes has insisted that the signing of Cristiano Ronaldo by Manchester United distracted three Red Devils players. The three players are Marcus Rashford, Bruno Fernandes and Jadon Sancho. Recall that Man United resigned Ronaldo from Juventus last summer. But Barnes believes Fernandes, Rashford and Sancho would have had better seasons if Ronaldo was not in the team. In a podcast for William Hill (via the Mirror), Barnes said, “He (Cristiano Ronaldo) detracts from other players. “(Marcus) Rashford would have had a better season, (Bruno) Fernandes would have had a better season, (Jadon) Sancho would have had a better season. Whoever signed Ronaldo, it’s their fault.”
