The youth wing of apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide has accused the All Progressives Congress-led Federal Government of attempting to put the country’s democracy in jeopardy. Ohanaeze youths in a statement issued on Sunday by President-General, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike said President Muhammadu Buhari’s delay in the signing of the amended Electoral Act was not a good signal. He said some persons who do not mean well for the country were ill-advising the President. DAILY POST reports that an air of uncertainty is hovering within the political circle as political parties begin primary elections this week, even without the President’s accent on the amended Electoral Act. It was rumoured on Saturday that the President signed the Act but it was later confirmed by the presidency to be false. Reacting to the development, the Igbo group said the present All Progressives Congress, APC, administration would be held responsible should anything happen to the country’s democracy. “We are so worried over Mr. President’s seeming refusal to sign the Amended Electoral Act. “This is more troubling considering the commencement of primary elections this week. We do not know how political parties would escape this legal landmine put on their way by the ruling government. “But we warn that nothing must happen to the country’s democratic process. It must be allowed to flow without a hitch. “If the President means well for our dear country, he should sign the Electoral Act without further delay. “However, the government would be held responsible should anything happen to the country’s democratic process. Mr. President should not listen to those who do not mean well for the country,” Okwu advised.
