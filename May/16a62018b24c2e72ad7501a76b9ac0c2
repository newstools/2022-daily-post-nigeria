The Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Idris Wase, has raised the alarm on the rate of kidnapping in his constituency, Wase Federal Constituency of Plateau State. Mr Wase raised the alarm on Wednesday while speaking on a motion of matter of urgent public importance moved by Abdullahi Salame from Sokoto State. “Virtually, every day in my constituency today, I have one kidnap report or the other — every day,” he said. The motion had called for the establishment of a national task force to combat insecurity. Mr. Wase opposed the establishment of a new security outfit, saying the existing security outfits should be allowed to discharge their duties. According to Wase, the creation of a new outfit is unconstitutional, rather the existing outfits should be strengthened to discharge their duties. The prayer to establish the new outfit was rejected, however, a new motion was moved by the Deputy Minority Leader, Toby Okechukwu, asking President Muhammadu Buhari to save Nigerians from the current security situation. Okechukwu’s amendment was adopted by the President.
