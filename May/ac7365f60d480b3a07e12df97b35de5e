Liverpool winger, Mohamed Salah, has confirmed he will remain at the club for the 2022/2023 season. Salah stated this during a press conference on Wednesday ahead of this weekend’s Champions League final against Real Madrid. The 31-year-old has been linked with a move away from Anfield, with his current contract set to expire next year. But he said: “In my mind, I don’t focus on the contract. I don’t want to be selfish at all. I said two months ago it’s about the team. It’s an important week for us. “I’m just focused on the team and winning the Champions League again. I want to see Hendo [Jordan Henderson] with the trophy in his hands and hopefully, he gives it to me. I don’t want to talk about the contract now, I’m staying next season for sure, that’s clear.”
