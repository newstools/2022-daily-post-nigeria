Tottenham Hotspur manager, Antonio Conte, has decided to stay at the club ahead of next season, after guiding them back into the Champions League. Spurs thrashed Norwich 5-0 on the final day of the Premier League to pip rivals Arsenal to fourth spot. However, Conte refused to commit his future to the club after that match. The Italian tactician held talks with managing director Fabio Paratici in Turin on Friday. It is believed the pair discussed summer transfer targets and Conte has now opted to remain at Tottenham, according to The Telegraph. Having replaced Nuno Espirito Santo last November, the 52-year-old won 17 of his 28 league games in charge.
