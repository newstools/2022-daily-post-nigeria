Chelsea legend, Jason Cundy, has blamed goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli for Villarreal’s Champions League semi-final second leg 3-2 defeat to Liverpool on Tuesday. Cundy said Rulli was at fault for the goals Villarreal conceded against Liverpool. Recall that Villarreal took a two-goal lead in the first half of the tie, but Liverpool struck back in the second half, thanks to three goals from Fabinho, Luis Diaz and Sadio Mane. Speaking after the match, talkSPORT host Cundy said: “The goalkeeper, he’s a shocker, I’m sorry. He was at fault for four of the five goals. “How can you go into a Champions League semi-final with a goalkeeper that isn’t good enough to be an understudy in the Championship? “Honestly, Sam Johnstone, there’s a lot of clubs after him, he’s out of contract, he’s a better goalkeeper than what I saw tonight and what I’ve seen over the two legs,” he added.
