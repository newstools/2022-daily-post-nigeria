Real Madrid has been named world’s most valuable football team at $5.1 billion by Forbes. The Los Blancos who won the LaLiga title and will now face Liverpool in the Champions League final in Paris on May 28, leapfrog fierce rivals Barcelona, who topped the Forbes list last year. Carlo Ancelotti’s side will take home in excess of £100m for reaching the Champions League final and their value has risen 7 per cent. The Spanish giants are the sixth most valuable sports team in the world after the Dallas Cowboys, New York Yankees, New York Knicks, Golden State Warriors and Los Angeles Lakers, in that order. Real Madrid’s old rivals Barcelona have hit the headlines for huge debts and an unstable financial situation, but they remain the second most valuable football club at $5 billion, according to Forbes. Behind Barcelona are Manchester United (4.6$ billion), Liverpool (4.45$ billion), Bayern Munich (4.275$ billion), Manchester City (4.25$ billion), Paris Saint-Germain (3.2$ billion), Chelsea (3.1$ billion), Juventus (2.45$ billion) and Tottenham (2.35 $ billion). —
