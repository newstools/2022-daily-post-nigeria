Campus shop owners, in Kaduna State University (KASU), on Thursday, lamented the continuous strike embarked upon by the Academic Staff Union of Universities. DAILY POST recalls that ASUU had embarked on a one-month warning strike on February 14, 2022, but because their demands were not met, the union vowed to continue until the Federal Government responds favourably. However, during the visit by DAILY POST, on Thursday, to the main campus of the Kaduna State University, the environment was quiet, while many business centres within the school campus, especially, the photocopying and binding shops were under lock and key. Only a few administrative workers were seen moving files from one department to the other. However, two shops which were open within the administrative block, only sell snacks and food to staff. The shop owners also complained of low patronage as only a handful of people were in the administrative block. Speaking with DAILY POST, one of the shop owners, Mohammed Abdul who sells snacks said he operates on a skeletal basis. He said when the school is in session, he sells between N5,000 – N7,000 daily. Now that lecturers are on strike, he only sells between N400, N500 daily, as only administrative workers come to buy from him. “The situation I found myself in is so terrible that I cannot feed my family. Since the lecturers embarked on strike, I only incurred debt.” He said He appealed to the federal government, ASUU to settle their issues amicably Also speaking, Mallam Yahaya Jibrin who repairs/polishes shoes within the school premises said he cannot feed his family since the students vacated the school. “I can no longer feed my family since students vacated the school hostel because of ASUU strike. ”When students were in session, I made between N2,000 – N3,000 daily but since ASUU strike, I can only boast of N200 or at most, N500 a day”.
