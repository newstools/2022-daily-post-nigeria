The Nigerian government is working with stakeholders to intensify surveillance and prevent the outbreak of monkeypox. Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Mohammad Abubakar, made the disclosure on Friday in Abuja. The official said the points of entry for wildlife were under scrutiny while awareness among hunting communities is ongoing. He noted that the disease could affect farmers and cause low agricultural production and productivity if unchecked. Abubakar advised the public to avoid contact with animals that are sick, found dead, and their items. The minister called for increased hygiene, hand washing and the use of alcohol-based sanitizers after contact with infected animals or humans. He assured Nigerians and foreign countries of continued collaboration with relevant sectors to promptly contain the disease in the event of an outbreak. Monkeypox, first detected in 1958 in monkeys and rodents, is now transmissble to man and other animals. The symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, and exhaustion.
