A Presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, has disclosed how he raised N100 million to purchase the party’s presidential forms. Nwajiuba disclosed that he sold yams and got donations from friends to purchase the forms. The former Minister of State for Education, said about 3,150 Nigerians contributed money and yams to purchase his forms. Nwajiuba, who resigned from Buhari’s cabinet to pursue his presidential ambition, disclosed this while addressing newsmen in Abuja. “I have members of the House of Representatives from 1992 who endorsed me, even before they contributed money. Some have paid N1,000 each. “One man from Nasarawa gave me 150 yams from his farm to sell. People are investing with the hope that there may be a new Nigeria,” he said.
