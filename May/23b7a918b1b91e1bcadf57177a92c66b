The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has finally arrested Rochas Okorocha, an All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential aspirant. EFCC picked up Okorocha from his residence in Maitama area of Abuja on Tuesday evening. The anti-graft agency had earlier invaded the residence of the former Imo State governor in an attempt to arrest him. Gunshots were said to have been shot during the invasion of Okorocha’s house. EFCC had explained that Okorocha jumped an administrative bail he was granted and had refused to honour its invitations. Okorocha is accused of diverting public properties worth N2.9 billion while he was governor of Imo State. EFCC had filed a 17-count charge against Okorocha before an Abuja Federal High Court, on January 24, 2022.
