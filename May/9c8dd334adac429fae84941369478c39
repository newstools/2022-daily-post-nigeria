The Lawmaker who was an aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, APC stated this in a statement he personally signed on Monday.

The statement reads partly, “Since there is no zoning and the contest is open to all Nigerians , I officially withdraw from presidential contest in 2023. I have also picked ticket to run for Abia North Senatorial zone and to complete the good work I started in Abia North . “I urge all my friends , allies and supporters in the APC to toe the line of justice by supporting Senator Ahmad Lawan , a North Easterner for the presidential ticket of the APC”.
