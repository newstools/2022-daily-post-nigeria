The Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) has announced that it has revoked contracts awarded before December 31, 2019, where the contractors didn’t move to the site. Dr Ibitoye Abosede, NDDC’s Director of Corporate Affairs, made the announcement in a statement on Sunday. Abosede directed the affected contractors to refund the monies to the commission’s account with the CBN. The statement read in part, “Consequently, all affected contractors are advised to note that all monies earlier received by way of mobilisation for any of the projects are to be promptly refunded. “The contractors are to refund the monies to the commission’s account with the CBN. “This is to bring to the notice of all contractors engaged by the NDDC, as well as stakeholders and the general public, the implementation of the forensic audit report. “The cancellation is also in line with the terms of the contracts for the award of the said projects.” This is coming less than a week after operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, arrested Nsima Ekere, a former Managing Director of the NDDC, for alleged diversion of funds to the tune of N47 billion through registered contractors of the agency.
