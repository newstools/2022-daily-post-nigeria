The Leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, on Tuesday, revealed the winners of the Ekiti and Osun States gubernatorial election. The governorship election in Osun and Ekiti States is scheduled to hold in June and July 2022 respectively. However, Primate Ayodele revealed that only a coalition can unseat the All Progressive Congress, APC, in Ekiti State. Ayodele said he doesn’t see any other party winning the election in June apart from the APC. In a statement signed by his Media Aide, Osho Oluwatosin, the clergy noted that those that have come out to contest against the ruling party have not done their assignment properly, adding that the ruling party will retain the state. He, however, warned that there will be security threats during the election while advising relevant authorities to make provisions for security during the election. According to Ayodele: ‘’In Ekiti, Only a coalition can unseat APC in the state, and those who have come out to contest against the ruling party in the election have not done their assignment properly, APC will retain the state. it will be tough, there will be stealing of ballot, rigging, attacks and I advise the authorities to make more provisions for security during the election.’’ In Osun, Primate Ayodele revealed that the APC will retain the state, noting that the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, will only try its best but it won’t be enough. ‘’In Osun state, the election will be volatile, they need prayers for the election so that God can take control. PDP will only try its best but I don’t see the PDP flag in the state or any other party. It’s still APC. Governor Oyetola will retain his seat, he should just put more efforts.’’
