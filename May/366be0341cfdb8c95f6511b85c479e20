President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday said Nigeria and Africa were concerned about the Russia-Ukraine war. Buhari spoke at the State House when he received the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres. He said Nigeria remained grateful to the UN and world leaders for their steadfast partnership in fighting terrorism. The leader noted that the spotlight on Russia and Ukraine could easily distract everyone from other pertinent global challenges. Buhari however said the UN scribe’s visit showed that “the world has not forgotten us.” The President called terrorism a threat to global peace, security and progress, with many killed and millions displaced. “When we assumed office, the North-East was the major security problem we inherited in 2015. “But we have been able to make people understand that you cannot kill people and shout ‘Allahu Akbar,’ (God is great!). “It is either you don’t know what you are saying or you are simply stupid. God is a God of justice, so you cannot kill people and say God is great. “Luckily the people understood our message and it has made a great impact”, he said. Buhari told Guterres the government had started the process of resettlement and reintegration of citizens so they can return to their farms, businesses and other pursuits in life.
