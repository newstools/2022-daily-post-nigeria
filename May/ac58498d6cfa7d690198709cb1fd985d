Nwifuru, who is the anointed successor of Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State, made this known in a statement signed and made available to journalists in Abakaliki. He described the alleged killings as unfortunate, adding that the killers may not be indigenes of the state. According to him: “This morning, I received with rude shock, the despicable attack on the home of the Executive Chairman of Ikwo Local Government Area, Elder Stephen Orogwu, by unknown bad eggs, which resulted in the burning of his house and loss of lives. “I condemn this unfortunate mayhem in the strongest possible terms. I can affirm that these unscrupulous elements are not for Ebonyians and do not represent our ideals as a people. “As Government, we will toughen our security measures and redouble our efforts to root out all these bad eggs and fish out all of them, the culprits, to face the wrath of the Law. “I condole the Orogwu family and the entire people of Ikwo Local Government Area,” he stressed. Investigation revealed that the killers had plans to apprehend the council chairman Orogwu, fortunately, he wasn’t around and they (gunmen) decided to kill his brothers and set his house ablaze. Orogwu who confirmed the killings said the unknown gunmen killed his elder brother, two of his sons and a security guard.
