Arsenal legend, Thierry Henry has picked Karim Benzema and Sadio Mane as his choice of players for this year’s ballon d’Or. Both Mane and Benzema will come face to face in the Champions League final in France later this month after Real Madrid and Liverpool secured their places. Liverpool defeated Villarreal to progress to the final, while Real Madrid saw off Manchester City in the semis. Benzema, 34, has scored 43 goals in all competitions for the season, netting four times across both legs of the quarter-finals against Chelsea. Mane, on the other hand, has excelled for Liverpool and Senegal of late, contributing with crucial goals for club and country and could make a ‘strong case’ to win the Ballon d’Or. But Henry feels Benzema is ‘ahead’ in the race to win the coveted award. “If you think about the [Champions League] final and to make it even bigger, the two favourites for the Ballon d’Or are Mane and Benzema,” Henry told CBS Sports. “So that will add a little extra spice into it. “I still believe that Benzema is ahead, but if Mane wins it with Liverpool and they do make the quadruple, that would be a pretty strong case. “It would be great for Africa, but I’m still going with Benzema.”
