Paris Saint-Germain forward, Kylian Mbappe has played down Karim Benzema’s dig after his decision to reject a move to Real Madrid and stay at the French Ligue 1 champions. Mbappe appeared to be set on joining Real Madrid this summer after reportedly agreeing to a contract with the LaLiga champions. But the 23-year-old performed a late U-turn and agreed to a new deal with the Parisians, which keeps him tied to the club until 2025. After Mbappe’s decision, Benzema posted an image of his hand pointing at the Real Madrid badge on his Instagram account and another image of late American rapper, Tupac, shaking hands with actor Stephen Baldwin. The image has connotations of betrayal as some believe the man in the background of the image allegedly betrayed Tupac. Speaking on the development, Mbappe told Marca: “Yes, yes, and I saw several Real Madrid players publishing things. I have nothing to say. “Of course, when I go to the French national team, I will explain to Karim why I stayed at PSG because we have a good relationship.” When asked about Benzema’s post during his press conference, Mbappe replied that he would explain to the Real Madrid striker in France Mbappe said: “You don’t have to have done Saint-Cyr [French military training] to understand that it comes from above, right? “I didn’t want to overdo it. I know everyone was talking about Karim and Kylian, Kylian and Karim… but when we were with the national team, we were only talking about the evening meal. We weren’t talking about Real Madrid. “I didn’t didn’t want to force this thing. When we see each other, we’ll discuss it. He’ll ask me why and I’ll explain this choice to him.”
