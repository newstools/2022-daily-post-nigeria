One of the senatorial aspirants on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo Central Senatorial District, Engineer Faozey Nurudeen Oladotun has insisted that he won the primaries conducted in the district. Oladotun, who made this known in a statement through Semiu Alebiosu, his campaign director, on Monday, urged the leadership of the APC to declare him as the winner because he scored the highest number of votes during the poll. Our correspondent recalls that no fewer than seven aspirants in the party indicated interest to represent Oyo Central Senatorial District in the National Assembly in the next general elections. The primary election was held in the Moniya area of Ibadan on Saturday. Oladotun, who polled 300 in the primary election, insisted that he won, having scored the highest in the election held on Saturday and presided over by Mrs Ajibike. He said that he scored 300 votes to defeat Dr. Yunus Akintunde who scored 114 votes, Hon. Bimbo Kolade who scored 30 votes, Mr Oyeleru Oyedemi who scored 43 votes and Senator Ayo Adeseun who scored 0 vote. He added that it will be wrong to declare someone who came second as the winner of an election held in a democratic setting. “I was the winner of the APC primary election held in Oyo central. I scored 300 votes. “The election was held on Saturday and presided over by Mrs Ajibike. It was held at Royal Seed Event Centre, Moniya, Ibadan. “I scored 300 votes ahead of Dr Yunus Akintunde (114), Hon. Bimbo Kolade (30), Mr Oyeleru Oyedemi (43) and Senator Ayo Adeseun (0). “So, how can someone who came second be announced as the winner of the election. I am appealing to the APC leadership not to upturn my victory. I won the election,” he said.
