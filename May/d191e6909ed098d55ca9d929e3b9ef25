The Jama’atu Nasril Islam (JNI) has advised the federal and state governments to take proactive and concrete actions against all forms of criminalities in the country. Dr. Khalid Aliyu, the Secretary-General of JNI in a statement in Kaduna, enjoined the government not to hesitate in making efforts to immediately take control of all forests and swampy areas that have become hideouts for criminals. According to him, there is an urgent need for speedy arrest and prosecution of all criminals, devoid of legal encumbrances. According to him, constituting commissions of inquiry should not be the only way to go, advising that government should intensify efforts in identifying and prosecuting the so-called unknown gunmen. The statement explained, “Governments at all levels, in collaboration with different security agencies, must be up and doing against the tides of insecurity in whatever guise.” JNI believed that thorough proactive measures should be taken in nipping the situations in the bud, before becoming uncontrollable. It also enjoined governments to strategise and bring an end to orgies of killings happening in Nigeria, saying desperate situations need desperate measures. JNI opined that constituting a joint task force to specially attend to the rising tide of killings in South-Eastern Nigeria should be considered. It is also of the opinion that governments at all levels should act beyond mere verbal condemnations on security-related matters. The statement noted that the unfortunate spate of the horrendous butchering of human lives in the country should be halted.
