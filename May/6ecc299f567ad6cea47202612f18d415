A Kaduna Chief Magistrates Court on Thursday sentenced one Waziri Gambo, a 35-year-old man, to six months imprisonment for impersonating a court clerk. Gambo, who resides in Kawo, Kaduna State, had begged for leniency as he pleaded guilty to conspiracy and impersonation. The Chief Magistrate, Ibrahim Emmanuel, however, gave the convict an option to pay a fine of N20,000. The Prosecution Counsel, Insp. Chidi Leo had earlier told the court that the convict and one other at large, portrayed themselves as a court clerk, a representation they knew to be false. According to the prosecution counsel, the convict and his accomplice are in the habit of collecting money from litigants, pretending to be court officials. He explained that the offence contravened the provisions of Sections 57 and 261 of the Kaduna State Penal Code.
