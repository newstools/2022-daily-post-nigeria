Residents and motorists in Osogbo have appealed to the Osun State Government to fast-track the construction on the second phase of the Oba Adesoji Aderemi East Bye-Pass. The completion of the dual carriage road, the motorists added, will reduce the number of accidents recorded on the road to the barest minimum. Commercial motorcyclists, motorists and residents who spoke to DAILY POST, disclosed that there have been series of accidents on the single lane which had been completed from Testing Ground to Oke-Baale roundabout. Lamenting the poor state of the road, the motorists and commercial transporters also disclosed that the roundabout in Shasha remained the most dangerous portion of the road. Adekunle Alabi, a commercial motorcyclist, explained that flood had overtaken the uncompleted second phase of the dual carriageway. He also appealed to the State Government to complete the second phase of the East Bye-Pass in order to stop the carnage recorded on the completed carriage which experiences heavy flow of traffic. He stressed that completion of the road will allow for smooth-flow of traffic in and out of the road. He said: “We urge the State Government to fast-track the completion of this road. There have been some recorded accidents on one side of the road which has been tarred. We are appealing to Mr Governor to complete the road before flood totally damage the uncompleted part.” A resident, Samson Aderowo stated that the completion of the uncompleted second phase was very necessary as the road served as a strategic purpose as it aided the economic development of the area. Aderowo hinted that the road construction, which has opened up the area to investments, has attracted business owners and land acquisition, as houses were being developed rapidly. DAILY POST observed that the second phase of the road from Testing Ground area towards Oke-Baale and Ilesa Garage roundabout, which is still under construction, has been a major challenge to motorists.
