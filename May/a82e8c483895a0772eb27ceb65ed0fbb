President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated the new President of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed. He was elected President by a Federal Supreme Council to succeed his half-brother, the late Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed. In a statement on Saturday, Buhari said stepping into the shoes of the late Sheikh “is no easy task”. The Nigerian leader hailed the deceased for his experience and visionary skills. Buhari expressed confidence that the successor is equally well equipped for the task ahead. “I’m confident that you’re going to build on this great legacy created by your half-brother.” President Buhari said, “Nigeria looks forward to greater cooperation with the UAE “. He noted that the partnership has tremendously helped Nigeria “in tracking down illegal assets and tracing terrorist funds”. Noting that Dubai is a reliable partner in progress, Buhari believes the cooperation will grow bigger and stronger. In 2020, the UAE convicted six Nigerians for funding Boko Haram. The United States blacklisted them this year. The Nigerian government says it had identified terrorist sponsors but has yet to prosecute them. This is despite more than a decade of countless attacks which claimed thousands of citizens as well as security personnel.
