Real Madrid winger, Gareth Bale, on Saturday night, equalled Manchester United forward Cristiano Ronaldo’s record fifth Champions League trophy after the Los Blancos defeated Liverpool in the final in Paris. Bale played just seven minutes in the Champions League this season. The 32-year-old was an unused substitute in the Champions League final as Real Madrid defeated Liverpool 1-0 in Paris. But the Wales international signed off his career at the Santiago Bernabeu after collecting a winners’ medal for the fifth time. He won the competition in 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018 and now 2022 at the Stade de France. His teammate, Vinicius Jr, scored a second-half winner as Bale watched on from the sidelines before gleefully collecting one last winner’s medal with Real Madrid. The former Tottenham Hotspur star even took his place in the front row for the Spanish giants’ trophy lift.
