Hafsat Abiola-Costello, the daughter of late MKO Abiola, has stated that the dream of her mother, late Kudirat Abiola, for a better Nigeria would soon be actualized. According to Abiola-Costello, her mother’s dream was for Nigerian women to have bountiful opportunities like their male counterparts. Abiola-Costello, who is the Director-General of the Yahaya Bello Presidential Campaign Organisation, stated this on Wednesday in Akure, the Ondo State capital. She maintained that Nigerian women need someone who will give them voice, adding a Yahaya Bello presidency will uplift them beyond their expectations. “I am so happy that Nigerian women have decided, for once, to take their destinies in their hands. “By supporting that one Governor that has given them so much voice and has made the world to see how women can turn stone into bread in a troubled economy. He will do the same for Nigeria.”
