Popular Nigerian dancer, Korra Obidi has confessed to cheating on her estranged husband, Justin Dean. The mother of two disclosed that she cheated on her husband while she was in Nigeria in a one time affair before she moved to America to be with him. She made this known during an Instagram live session with her sister, Nancy Umeh. Narrating her side of the story, Korra denied being a chronic cheat, explaining that her ex-husband subjected her to physical and emotional abuse which led to her losing a pregnancy after she told him about her affair. “Most of you have heard one side of the story, it is time for you to hear my side of the story. I’m not a chronic cheat, I’m far from that, I’m just a woman who was honest to her husband. “Before I came to America, it was during Trump’s tenure, I was very indecisive about moving and I tasted from Pandora’s box; I had an affair. That affair lasted like one date, I felt bad about it but I had not moved to America. “Upon getting to America, I was sad that I had made that mistake with the guy so I told Dean the truth, I said,” Hey, I had an affair in Nigeria and I don’t want us to ever have secrets,” Korra Obidi revealed. The mother of two also accused her ex-husband of cheating as she shared videos of Dean with his alleged 18-year-old mistress all loved up on a trip in Brazil.
