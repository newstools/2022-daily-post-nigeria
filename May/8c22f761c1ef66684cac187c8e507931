President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the withdrawal of Nigeria from all international basketball competitions. The immediate suspension, the peak of years of leadership crisis, will last for two years. Sunday Dare, Minister of Youth and Sports Development, announced the order on Thursday. Dare, represented by Ismaila Abubakar, the Permanent Secretary, said a committee would be set up to oversee basketball leagues. “President Buhari has approved the withdrawal of Nigeria from all international basketball competitions for a period of two years”, he said. Dare added that the development would allow the government to concentrate on efforts to revamp the sport. The Interim Management Committee (IMC) will supervise the management and development of the leagues. Two parallel national federation board elections were held in 2017 (in Kano and Abuja) and 2022 (in Benin and Abuja).
