Manchester United legend, Roy Keane has questioned the club’s interim boss, Ralf Rangnick’s decision to start Juan Mata for their Premier League clash with Brentford. Manchester United, who played their final home game of the season against Brentford, are still keeping the hope of playing in the Europa League alive. And Rangnick handed Juan Mata his first league start of the season and retained the likes of Fred and Marcus Rashford on the bench. Mata will certainly depart Old Trafford at the end of the season with his contract ending in June, meaning tonight could be his farewell appearance in front of the home crowd. “I’m surprised, it’s his first start of the season,” he said on Sky Sports. “They obviously know he’s leaving the club and I think the manager looked at it and thought a bit of loyalty, I’ll give him a run out. “I just think it tells you where the mindset is. I think they’re giving players a run out for the wrong reasons.” The Spaniard has made just five Premier League appearances for Manchester United this season and saw 20 minutes of action in their last game against his former club, Chelsea. Mata came close to scoring against Brentford on Monday night when he blasted over the bar a Cristiano Ronaldo’s backheel pass with his weaker right foot.
