A lecturer at University of Uyo and the Akwa Ibom State University, Dr. Clement Obadimu, has attributed the failure of the federal government to meet the demands of the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, to misplaced priorities. Obadimu, who stated this on Wednesday during an interaction with journalists, regretted that FG has placed certain things above ASUU’s problems. He, however, called out government officials who purchased exorbitant nomination forms for as much as N100m naira, saying that such display of wealth is out of place given the fact that the federal government has been unable to meet the demands of ASUU. Obadie, a lecturer in the department of Institute of Safety, Health, Security and Environmental Studies on voluntary services, said the ASUU demands were not beyond the scope of the federal government. The varsity don, who said he is not speaking for ASUU because he is not their member, said, ” The federal government may say that there are so many things to do, but at the same time, the government cannot say that they cannot solve ASUU’s problem. I am not speaking for ASUU, I am not a member of ASUU because I teach on voluntary services, but the government should be able to solve ASUU problems. He, therefore, called on private organisations and individuals across the country to join hands with the federal government and salvage the situation to enable students return to classrooms. He said “The government may say that there are too many things to do, the private individuals and organisations can team up and say let us see what we can do. I know abroad that private individuals normally come together to salvage such a situation like that.”
