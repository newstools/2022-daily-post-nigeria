A teenager, Halima Yunusa, on Monday, dragged her father before a Sharia Court sitting in Magajin Gari, Kaduna State for allegedly refusing to get her married to her lover, Bashir Yusuf. Halima, who lives in Kasuwan Magani, Chikun Local Government Area of the State, told the court that she was in love with Yusuf, but that her parents refused her to get married to him Halima’s father, Ibrahim, who is a businessman, stated clearly in his defence that he was aware of the “extreme love” between his daughter and Yusuf, but that Yusuf is yet to fulfill all known marriage obligations. Halima’s father admitted that Yusuf came to him and expressed his desire to marry his daughter, but he told him to bring his parents and family members. He said Yusuf is yet to bring his parents after about a year. He said Yusuf came back after a year and took his daughter and ran away with her for three days, adding that he later heard they came back and went to his sister’s house. According to him, he informed the Police and both of them were arrested and disciplined. He said after their release from police custody, they ran away to Abuja where they spent two weeks. Ibrahim added that he later met with the boy’s father and had several discussions, but his father said he would not allow his son to marry my daughter. “At last, his father later took us to the district head of our village where agreements were drafted and signed by all of us and our witnesses to caution my daughter to stay away from his son,” he said. The judge, Murtala Nasir, after listening to both parties, held that Yusuf’s father should be advised to allow the children to get married. According to the Judge, “If he refuses, we will get them married in the court even without his blessings.” The Judge, while adjourning the case until May 23 for Yusuf’s father to appear before the court for final judgment, advised the complainant to seek her parents’ and relatives’ forgiveness in order to have their blessings in her life.
