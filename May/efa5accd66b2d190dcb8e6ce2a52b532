Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has said he expects to have Ben White fit for their trip to Tottenham Hotspur on Thursday. White has missed the last two league fixtures against West Ham and Leeds United. The Gunners recorded victories in the two games and now sit four points ahead of Spurs going into the North London Derby. Speaking after a nervy 2-1 win over Leeds, Arteta was asked about White’s fitness. He replied: “I think so [he’ll be available against Tottenham]. “He’s starting to do a little bit of work on the pitch. We want everyone available.” On the game itself, Arteta added: “I cannot wait to play that match”.
