Tottenham Hotspur manager, Antonio Conte, has said it will not be easy for Arsenal in the top-four race, even if they have a slight advantage. Conte was speaking after their 1-1 draw with Liverpool on Saturday. Son Heung-Min opened the scoring at Anfield before Luis Diaz’s deflected strike from range rescued a point for the Reds. “There are three games to go for us, four games for Arsenal. Not easy for us, not easy for Arsenal. In November, not many people could believe Tottenham could fight to the end for the Champions League. “On Thursday, we have an important game, a London derby against our rival, our rival in this race. I want to get the points because it is important to have hope of the Champions League,” Conte said.
