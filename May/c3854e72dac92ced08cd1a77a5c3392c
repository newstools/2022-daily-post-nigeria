Inter Milan’s Ivan Perisic is set for a shock move to Chelsea this summer. Chelsea have reached an initial agreement to sign Perisic on a free transfer from Inter Milan, according to Sports Mediaset on Friday. Perisic is ready to leave Inter Milan as a free agent at the end of the season. He is out of contract with the Serie A champions at the end of the season and is yet to reach a new agreement with the club. It’s understood that the 33-year-old has been demanding a new three-year contract worth just under £100,000 a week, but Inter are only offering a two-year deal worth around £65,000 a week. The report added that the Croatia international has been angered by Inter’s approach to his contract situation and criticised the club after he scored twice in their win over Juventus in the Coppa Italia final on Wednesday evening. The deal between both parties is subject to a medical and the final formalities of the agreement have not yet been signed off, but Chelsea appears to be in the driving seat to sign Perisic.
