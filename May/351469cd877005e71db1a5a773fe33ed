There was pandemonium in Ugbolu community, near Asaba, Delta State on Wednesday as gunmen suspected to be members of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, allegedly enforced sit-at-home in the area. DAILY POST recalls that the secessionist group had announced that sit-at-home would be observed in all parts of the southeast on May 18 as its leader, Nnamdi Kanu returns to court. According to Vanguard, the gunmen who were on the rampage in the southeast and some parts of Delta, burnt down two Dangote trucks, one keke and damaged one Audi car. The suspected IPOB elements reportedly blocked the Ugbolu/Illah Road at Mile 5, shooting indiscriminately. The Vanguard gathered that one was feared killed during the shooting. When contacted by DAILY POST, the state’s Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, DSP Bright Edafe said he was yet to get the report.
