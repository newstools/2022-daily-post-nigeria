Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp, has revealed one advantage Real Madrid have over his team ahead of both sides’ UEFA Champions League final. Liverpool will face Real Madrid in the Champions League final in Paris on May 28. But Klopp believes Carlo Ancelotti’s side have an advantage going into the clash because they have already won the LaLiga title. Recall that Real Madrid won the LaLiga title with four games to spare, and they can now focus on their preparations for the Champions League final against Liverpool. Meanwhile, Liverpool, having won the FA Cup over the weekend after beating Chelsea, have to beat Southampton on Tuesday night, as well as Wolves on Sunday, while needing Manchester City to slip up if they want to win their league title. “We are going to play against a team with the most experienced in the world,” Klopp said in his latest press conference, according to Marca. “I don’t believe that we are favourites. They [Real Madrid] have already won La Liga and they have this advantage.”
