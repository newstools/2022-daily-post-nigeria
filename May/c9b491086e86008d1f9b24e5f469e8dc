The increase in child abuse cases, including sexual assaults, rape and violence against children in Nigeria has become very worrisome. International Welfare Fellowship and Girls Leading Africa have called for greater action to warn parents, guardians and schools to be wary of continual violence against children. They are alarmed over the alarming increase in cases of child abuse in Nigerian communities. They urged groups, religious institutions, individuals, and governments at all levels to sustain efforts to ensure the protection of the rights of every child in the country. In a press statement signed by the founder of GLA, Giftie Umoh, the group said, “As we celebrate this year’s Children’s Day, we must boldly challenge the painful truth that in many of our nation’s under-resourced communities, the rights of our children are violated daily through the denial of basic necessities of life, including education. “We deny them the chance to make the most of their talents and gifts because of their gender, ethnic group, economic status, or living with a disability. “We have seen girls and children face heightened risks during communal crises due to breakdowns of protection structures and support, exposing them to child labour. ” International President, IWF, Nkoyo Udoh in concert with another philanthropic group, Mercy Fellowship has now held a motivational talks session to counsel children in Calabar. “We have to train and provide safer situations for our children. “Sterner measures should be meted out against people that assault and debase children.”
