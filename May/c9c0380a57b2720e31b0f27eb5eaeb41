Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State has downplayed the possibility of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, achieving self-determination in Nigeria. Mohammed said it would be difficult for IPOB to achieve self-determination in Nigeria because Igbos own half of the country. The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential aspirant spoke while wooing party’s delegates in Anambra State on Friday. According to Mohammed: “When I was minister of Federal Capital Territory, the Igbo capital investment in Abuja was over 50 percent. “That is the true position, not only in Abuja, but in Kano, Lagos, Kaduna and other states. So, we are interrelated and connected as a people in Nigeria. “We need to stabilise that symbiotic bond that binds us together. When IPOB is talking about self determination and self actualization, for where? When you owe over half of the country. “God may not give you everything. He has given something to you. That is the truth. Because of this, I am calling for this unity and fraternity among us. If the Igbo youth understand this, they will now know the need for peace and unity in the country.”
