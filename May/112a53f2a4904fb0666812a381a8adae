The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, SERAP, on Monday, threatened to drag President Muhammadu Buhari-led government to court. SERAP said it would sue the government in a bid to probe public officials who accepted Presidential nomination forms purchased for them by any group. The body noted that affected public officials may be guilty of bribery. In a tweet, SERAP wrote: “BREAKING: We’re suing to compel the Buhari administration to probe and prosecute public officials who accept presidential nomination forms bought for them by any group(s). “These public officials may be guilty of bribery, trading in influence or abuse of functions, as appropriate.” Some groups had purchased the nomination forms for some Presidential aspirants under the platform of the All Progressives Congress, APC. A group of friends had purchased the APC Presidential nomination forms for the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan on Monday. The forms were presented to him at the Senate guest house in Maitama, Abuja. Also, the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Governor, Godwin Emefiele’s Presidential nomination forms were purchased by a group on his behalf.
