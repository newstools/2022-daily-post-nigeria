Aston Villa manager, Steven Gerrard has named Thibaut Courtois as his Man of the Match following Real Madrid’s Champions League final 1-0 win over Liverpool on Saturday night. Courtois was at his brilliant best for Real Madrid in Paris, making a number of superb saves to help his team triumph against Liverpool and win their 14th Champions League. The former Chelsea shot-stopper denied Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane before half-time and produced a stunning save to keep out Salah in the second half after Vinicius Junior put the LaLiga champions ahead. Speaking after the game, Gerrard said on BT Sport, “He totally deserved the Man of the Match award. “He’s faced nine shots today and the second one from Sadio Mane is world-class, the last one from Salah is even better. “To get that strong an arm on it and push it wide was phenomenal. The Salah save… wow.”
