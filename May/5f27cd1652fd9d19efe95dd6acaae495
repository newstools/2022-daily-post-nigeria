Anambra State Deputy Governor, Onyekachukwu Ibezim, has said that no society can attain development in the face of insecurity. Ibezim said there is need for all Anambra people to support the state Governor, Prof Chukwuma Soludo, in his quest to secure the state, as only then can the state government achieve its developmental plans for the state. Ibezim made the call during the Third Session of the 12th Synod of Awka Diocese of the Anglican Communion, which is holding at Saint Peter’s Anglican Church, Abagana, Njikoka Local Government Area. The deputy governor, while addressing the synod delegates, stated that no meaningful development can thrive in any society that is faced with insecurity. He called on citizens to join the Anambra State Government in tackling the scourge, stating that phone numbers have been unveiled for citizens to report suspected cases that can lead to attacks, or persons that can aggravate the security of the state. He said, “The state government has good plans for Anambra people, but we need your support to deal with insecurity. “We urge the church to keep supporting and praying for Professor Chukwuma Soludo-led administration. No government can stand without the support of the church. “I promise that the state government will not pull out from supporting the church.” Ibezim re-emphasized the government’s desire to make the state a clean, habitable and prosperous homeland. He described the theme of the conference, ‘Running the Christian Race: The Implication in this Perilous Times’ as thought provoking. He also pleaded with the church to continue to promote the work of evangelism, while decrying the high rate of youth engagement in idolatry.
