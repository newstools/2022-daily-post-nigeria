Nigeria head coach, Jose Peseiro says the Super Eagles will entertain fans by playing attacking football under his tutelage. The Super Eagles are noted for their exciting brand of attacking football with pacy wingers. The former African champions struggled to replicate that brand of football during the five-year reign of erstwhile head coach Gernot Rohr. The Super Eagles were, however, truly at their flowing best in the second half of their 2-1 friendly defeat to Mexico on Sunday morning. “My philosophy as a coach is to play attacking football,” Peseiro told a press conference. “I love my team to score and pressure the opponent, this is the best way to unsettle your opponent and win games. “That is how we played in the second half against Mexico. “And we will work more ahead of the Ecuador game.” Peseiro’s charges will keep a date with Ecuador in another friendly on Thursday.
