The Nigerian Army on Tuesday dismissed allegations of corruption against some of its top officers. A statement by the Director, Army Public Relations, Brig.-Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, in Abuja, said some aggrieved personnel wrote an open letter to the president, accusing top army officers of corruption. An online report had emerged on Monday that some aggrieved personnel had, in an impersonal letter to President Muhammadu Buhari, accused top army officers of corruption. Nwachukwu said more worrisome was the insinuation that soldiers had threatened to embark on strike, saying such an action was tantamount to mutiny in the Armed Forces of Nigeria. He said the Nigerian army has subscribed to the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) as directed by the Federal Government since 2018. He added that the system had facilitated the flawless payment of salaries and allowances of personnel. Nwachukwu said subscribing to IPPIS was part of the effort to guard against fraudulent practices and entrench accountability and transparency in the system. According to him, the IPPIS does not permit any personnel access to payment processes. “These processes, undoubtedly, provide zero opportunity for anyone or group of persons to manipulate personnel entitlements. “It is also important to state that the army and sister services jointly operate a Consolidated Armed Forces Salary Structure (CONAFSS), which is applicable to the Armed Forces of Nigeria in general. “Therefore, what is applicable to personnel of other services (Nigerian Navy and Air Force), invariably applies to personnel of the Nigerian army. “Suffice to state that personnel salaries and allowances are promptly and appropriately paid, without any form of shortchanging,” he said.
