Oby Ezekwesili, a former Minister of Education, has called on the National Assembly to invite President Muhammadu Buhari to account for insecurity in the country. Ezekwesili made the call in response to the beheading of a member of the Anambra State House of Assembly, Okechukwu Okoye by unknown gunmen. Okoye’s head, without his body, was found on Saturday at Nnobi, in Nnewi South Local Government Area of Anambra State. This development occurred days after he was abducted. The Anambra lawmaker, from Soludo’s constituency, was kidnapped last week. Reacting, Ezekwesili tweeted: “Perhaps, now that our @nassnigeria has seen that their fellow lawmaker in Anambra State could be barbarically mangled by criminals, they will finally have the spunk to INVITE the Commander-in-Chief of Nigeria’s Armed Forces @MBuhari to ACCOUNT for Numbing Insecurity in the Land. “I stopped bothering to ask @MBuhari to do ANYTHING when 3 consecutive times until last year, observing his complete dissonance from a FAILING COUNTRY, one just had to ask for a Mental and Physical Evaluation of his capacity to continue to function as @NGRPresident. That’s it.”
