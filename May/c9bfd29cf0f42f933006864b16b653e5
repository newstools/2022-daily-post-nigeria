Manchester City could be confirmed as Premier League champions if Liverpool lose at Southampton on Tuesday night. Pep Guardiola’s men dropped points last weekend at West Ham, after they were held to a 2-2 draw at the London Stadium. City are now four points behind the Reds with one home against Aston Villa left. However, Liverpool will travel to St Marys Stadium on Tuesday, before hosting Wolves in their final league fixture on Sunday. Klopp has warned his players to be “careful” ahead of the game. “This is game 60 so we have to be very careful. We don’t finish the season tomorrow. “When did Southampton have their last game? 10-12 days? Southampton are completely fresh. They are always a well drilled team. We have to make changes. I don’t know how many,” he said.
