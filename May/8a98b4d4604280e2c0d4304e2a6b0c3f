Manchester City has been handed an important double injury boost ahead of their 2021/22 Premier League final day clash with Aston Villa on Sunday at Etihad Stadium. Man City manager, Pep Guardiola, welcomed the return of John Stones and Kyle Walker back to full training ahead of their huge title decider against Aston Villa this weekend. The Citizens head into the final matchday of the season as leaders of the Premier League table, with just one point ahead of Liverpool. With title implications on the line, Guardiola will want the strongest possible side at his disposal to claim their seventh Premier League title. Guardiola’s side have been boosted by the potential return of Stones and Walker, who returned to training on Thursday. The duo have been sidelined due to injury, missing Man City’s five previous fixtures in the league. Stones incurred a first-half ankle injury in Man City’s first-leg victory over Atletico Madrid in the quarter-finals of the Champions League and has not featured since. Walker, meanwhile, was injured in the side’s second-leg semi-final defeat against Real Madrid in the same competition. But Manchester Evening News reported that both could make surprise returns to Man City’s team for the crucial title-decider against Aston Villa. Guardiola will be able to shed light on the availability of the defenders in his pre-match press conference on Friday.
