Former Manchester United defender, Rio Ferdinand, has apologized to Roma boss, Jose Mourinho, claiming he was right about the Premier League club. Ferdinand admits the Portuguese has been vindicated over his comments about the issues at Old Trafford Mourinho finished second with United in the 2017/2018 campaign, but he was sacked a few months later with the side sitting in sixth place. Speaking after his dismissal, the 59-year-old told beIN Sports that his second-place finish was “one of the best jobs of my career” because of issues “behind the scenes” that people were not aware of. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Michael Carrick and Ralf Rangnick all having taken turns in the dugout before Erik ten Hag takes over this summer. And Ferdinand feels Mourinho’s criticism of the club’s structure and hierarchy has been proven right and believes he deserves more credit for the job he did. Speaking on his Vibe with FIVE YouTube show, Ferdinand said: “I think Jose Mourinho’s quote has aged so, so well. And me for one, I would apologise maybe to some extent in terms of the way you kind of looked at him and judged him. “I still think there were flaws in some of the ways he handled people and handled some of the situations that he was involved in. “But in terms of looking behind the scenes, that [quote] he said in 2019 on finishing second in the Premier League, that has aged so well. “We can see that there’s been stuff going on that’s wrong behind the scenes, but at that time we didn’t know the extent of it. Obviously Jose Mourinho did. “He wanted to get rid of numerous players and he wanted to bring in certain players, and obviously big wages and contracts were handed out to certain players and he’s thinking, “Woah, woah, woah, what’s going on?!”
