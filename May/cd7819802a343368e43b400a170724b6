Former lawmaker, Senator Shehu Sani, has told Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State that Southern Governors did not betray him following the emergence of Atiku Abubakar as the Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, for the 2023 general election. Sani, who represented Kaduna Central during the 8th National Assembly, believes the Southern Governors only looked beyond the primaries and decided to choose a formidable aspirant who could overcome northern sentiment, mobilise voters and ultimately win the general elections. Recall that Atiku emerged as the Presidential candidate of the PDP for the 2023 general election on Saturday. Atiku polled a total of 371 votes to defeat his closest challenger, Wike, who garnered 237 votes. Former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, scored 70; Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Emmanuel, scored 38; Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, polled 20 votes; Anyim Pius Anyim scored 14, Sam Ohabunwa polled 1 and Olivia Tariela also scored one vote. However, in a tweet via his Twitter handle on Tuesday, Sani wrote: “I don’t think the Southern Governors betrayed Wike; they simply looked beyond the primaries and opted for a formidable aspirant who can overcome northern sentiment, mobilise voters and ultimately win the general elections. “Wike remains an indispensable force for the battle ahead.”
