The two Manchester United players who fought dirty during training earlier this month have been revealed. According to the Daily Mail, they are Alex Telles and Hannibal. DAILY POST reported a bust-up between two Man Utd teammates, shortly after a 4-0 defeat at Brighton. It has now emerged that Tunisian international Hannibal and Brazil left-back Telles were those involved. However, both were named in interim manager Ralf Rangnick’s starting XI for the 1-0 defeat at Crystal Palace on the final day and are expected to still be United players next term. Telles had been linked with a return to former club Porto, but now looks set to stay at Old Trafford. Hannibal, meanwhile, has enjoyed a breakout season for the club after being promoted from the under-23 squad by Rangnick.
