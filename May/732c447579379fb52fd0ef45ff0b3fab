There are indications that the Department of State Services, DSS, has arrested two Boko Haram members in connection to the bomb explosion in Kano State. Eons Intelligence reported that the DSS recovered some explosive items from the arrested Boko Haram members. According to the report, four AK-47 rifles, two pistles, suicide vests, and several Improvised Explosive Materials, IEDs, were recovered from the suspects. Eons tweeted: “KANO BOMB-BLAST: Reports indicate that following intelligence operations, DSS has arrested 2 #BH Terrorists over the Kano bomb blast incident. Items recovered include 4 AK-47 rifles, 2 Pistols, Suicide Vests & several IED making materials.  “This latest development supports eyewitness accounts that the explosion was a suicide bomb attack. This is also coming just a few hours after @elrufai @GovKaduna announced that #BH #ISWAP has taken over 2 LGAs in Kaduna State. This successful Ops by DSS might have just saved Kano from a major doomsday. “ADVISORY: Increased BH/ISWAP/Ansarul activities in NW in recent times suggest a shift of focus of the group to the region. Public infrastructures like airports, Rail lines, Roads & Schools have been targeted. Active situational awareness is expedient. Report all unusual activities.”  DAILY POST recalls that a suspected suicide bomber had detonated a device near a school in the Sabon Gari area of Kano. The incident claimed many lives and injured an unspecified number of school children. Casualty figures are expected to rise. However, there has been a discrepancy on the actual cause of the incident as some eyewitnesses who visited the scene alleged that a suicide bomber attacked the area.
