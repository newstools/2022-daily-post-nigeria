Former Manchester United boss, Sir Alex Ferguson has privately told Cristiano Ronaldo to remain at the club, according to Sunday Mirror. Manchester United put up another disappointing display on Saturday, going down 4-0 at Brighton. The result killed every hope of the Red Devils making it to the Champions League next season as they now battle for a place in the Europa League. Despite the woeful season, veteran forward, Ronaldo was able to score 24 goals in 34 appearances. But the 37-year-old has faced criticism over his performances and has been accused of not doing enough to support United’s attack. Ronaldo signed an initial two-year contract with United last August and has the options for an additional 12 months, but the five-time Ballon d’Or winner is already considering his future. The newspaper reports that the Portugal international and his former boss, Ferguson have met each other at their homes on several occasions. The report says that the Scot has told his former player to see out his deal with the club. Erik ten Hag is yet to make a decision about Ronaldo’s future, with the Ajax boss set to move to United once the season is over.
