A group of Northern Solidarity Group for Timipre Sylva, yesterday, purchased a N100 million nomination form for the Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva. The spokesperson of the group, Suleiman Abdullahi, while presenting the form to Sylva on Monday in Abuja, said they purchased the form for him because they believed in his capacity and capability. According to him, “Nigerians can see from his antecedent from the State to the federal level that he has garnered necessary experience and is well accepted across the country. So, we know that his chances of winning the APC ticket is brighter.” Responding, Sylva said he was honoured and humbled for the show of love, saying it showed commitment not to him, but to Nigeria. He said: “I have tried my best since I was appointed by Mr. President to this office to do my service to Nigeria. But to realise that my efforts have been noticed by you Nigerians and that you Nigerians by yourself will go and take the trouble of obtaining the nomination and the expression of interest forms for me is very humbling. And I must also say it was very shocking at the same time. “But I’m very happy and pleased by this gesture. So what I will do now, I will not give you a straight answer right now. But I’m really thankful for what you have done because I need to consult. I need to consult my constituency and consult leaders of this country and then I’ll come back to you to let you know if I have taken the position also to run for this office. I thank you very much. “So you’ll give me a very short time. I will start right away with the consultation. I will go to my leader, for example the Ijaw Leader, Sir SK Clark, I will talk to him. I will also consult other leaders of the country and I will get back to you.”
