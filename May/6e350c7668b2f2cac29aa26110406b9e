Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel has revealed that he told his team how proud he was of them after their disappointing 6-5 penalty shootout loss to Liverpool in FA Cup final on Saturday. The match ended goalless at full time despite both sides coming close to scoring – Marcos Alonso and Christian Pulisic missing clear chances for Chelsea and Luis Diaz and Andy Robertson almost scoring for the Reds. Cesar Azpilicueta and Mason Mount both missed from the spot and Kostas Tsimikas scored the decisive penalty in a 6-5 win. Sadio Mane had the chance to clinch the trophy for Liverpool after Azpilicueta’s effort hit the post but he was denied by his Senegal teammate Edouard Mendy. “Like in the last final, in the Carabao Cup, it’s no regrets. I told the team I’m proud,” Tuchel told BBC. “We were sure that we would be competitive and make life very difficult for Liverpool. We did it again. “We got to 0-0 against maybe the best-attacking team in the world and we also created a lot of chances. “We deserved it, as they deserved it as well, but again we lose on penalties. “We are very disappointed of course. We are sad but at the same time proud.”
