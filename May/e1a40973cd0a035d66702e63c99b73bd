In line with its drive to open up rural development, the Benue State Government has earmarked N1.5bn for the construction of Tse Gbinde-Fada-Wergba road in Saghev Council ward, Guma Local Government Area. The road links Guma and Logo Local Government Areas of the state. Governor Samuel Ortom flagged off the construction of the road at Tse Utam on Monday, May 2nd, 2022. Ortom said the road, which covers 39 kilometres has five major bridges, several box culverts as well as rings and pipe culverts. He said the government has to cough out the amount despite the paucity of funds because of the desire of his administration to open up rural roads to enhance the security and economic well being of the people. Governor Ortom assured that the road together with the Tomatar-Agenke-Tse Ginde road, which had earlier been flagged off, cover 93 kilometres and would be completed and commissioned before the end of his tenure. He advised the people to take ownership of the projects in their domains by ensuring that they support the contractor and protect the equipment as well as materials from being stolen. The Contractor, Michael Vaatia expressed appreciation to Governor Samuel Ortom for his deliberate policy of encouraging indigenous contractors and assured him that he would execute the project to specifications. Earlier, the President-General Saghev Development Association, SDA, Mr. Amande Tsea said the people would not forget in a hurry what the Governor has done for them by undertaking the construction of the road. The Governor later commissioned the health facility built at Tse Tseen by the Victim Support Fund, VSF in conjunction with the Benue State Government.
