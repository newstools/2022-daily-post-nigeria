The camp of Gboyega Nasir Isiaka (GNI) has lambasted Lagos West Senator, Solomon Adeola, a.k.a. Yayi, over the Ogun West 2023 race. On Wednesday, the lawmaker picked the form to seek the All Progressives Congress (APC) ticket for the Senatorial District. A statement by GNI media office chided Yayi for insisting he would run for the position despite representing Lagos in the House of Representatives and the Senate. They further accused the lawmaker of continually working to deprive Yewa/Awori the opportunity to realize its goal since 2014. “Senator Adeola appears to have become swollen-headed by his fortuitous journey in the National Assembly,” they stated. The statement said the Lagos West seat, which Adeola occupies, will become vacant in 2023 as he had been told there is no third term for him. Yayi was advised to stop boasting and making a big deal of his ranking Senator status. “Our people in Ogun West are knowledgeable and not illiterates or vulnerables as he likes to insinuate. “We urge him to exercise restraint in his use of words against illustrious patriots who have sacrificed immensely in pursuit of emancipation for Ogun West”, the statement added.
