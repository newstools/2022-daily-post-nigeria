The Kogi State Government has warned civil servants in the state to steer clear of partisan politics. The Head of Service, Mrs Hannah Odiyo, gave the warning on Tuesday while reacting to a statement credited to the Chairman, Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), in Kogi State, Comrade Onuh Edoka, who in his address to the members of the newly constituted political steering committee urged them to drive Labour Party membership in the state. Odiyo charged all public or civil servants to stay completely out of partisan politics in the interest of the state. The Head of Service quoted the NLC Chairman to have said “the committee should make sure that all workers of this state are brought into the fold of Labour Party.” Odiyo, in her response to the statement, directed all civil or public servants to be aware and be guided by the provisions of Public Service Rule No: PSRS-030422 and 030423 which forbid civil or public servants’ involvement in partisan politics. According to her, the above rules only allow civil servants to register and cast their votes during election time and not to join any political party campaign in support for or against any political party. She asserted that all workers in the state should be properly guided against being misled by any group or political party.
