The Western Nigeria Security Network Agency, Amotekun Osun, has denied allegations against it by the Osun State chapter of the National Association of University Students (NAUS). This is as the Osun State owned security agency also disclosed that its image remained untainted, notwithstanding the level of intimidation and conspiracy. Recall that Osun Amotekun had arrested an alleged armed robber that had been terrorising some parts of Modakeke town and the Akure-Ilesa-Ife-Ibadan Expressway. Responding to an allegation of extortion and assault against it by NAUS, Yusuf Idowu, the media officer of the outfit, explained that some students were helping the armed robbers to escape arrest after a shootout with operatives in the area. He recalled that the personnel of the agency had chased some suspected armed robbers from the Ilesa-Ife Expressway after they hijacked a truck from a driver. “After a gun duel with the robbers and arrest of one of them identified as Osunnusi Taiwo, alias Taye Fumble, the rest ran away in another car and our operatives were hot on their trail. “Another vehicle emerged from a junction and blocked one of the vehicles on the trail of the robbers. It is a case of aiding the escape of robbery suspects. “After proper identification, some of those arrested at the scene were released, while the suspected armed robber was taken to the Amotekun Headquarters, Osogbo. “He was handed over to the police later in the day. We did not collect money from anyone as alleged,” he said. The Osun Amotekun spokesperson maintained that the agency had been a reputable security outfit since its establishment by the Osun State Government.
