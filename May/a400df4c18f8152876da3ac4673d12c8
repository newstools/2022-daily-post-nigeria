Manchester United, legend Gary Neville has singled out Cristiano Ronaldo for praise following a ‘Man-of-the-Match’ performance in his side’s Premier League 3-0 win over Brentford on Monday night. Ronaldo netted his 24th goal of the season when he converted a penalty after being fouled by Rico Henry in the second half. However, Bruno Fernandes and Raphael Varane also scored for Man United at Old Trafford. While on commentary duty for Sky Sports, Neville said: “(He scored) a goal, the build up to the penalty, his all-round performance has been outstanding. “He is still a phenomenon, at the age of 37.” He added, “He’s that important, it wouldn’t surprise me if he has demanded to know if he’s in the manager’s [Erik ten Hag] plans. He simply has to be in this form.”
