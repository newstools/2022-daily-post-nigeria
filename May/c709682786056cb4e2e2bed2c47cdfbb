Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp has admitted that Erling Haaland will be a good signing for Manchester City. The Premier League champions confirmed Haaland’s arrival from Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday. The Norway striker is set to join City after they agreed to pay his £51million release clause. Haaland has scored 85 goals in 88 appearances for Dortmund and Klopp admitted that Pep Guardiola’s side is going to be a real handful with Haaland leading the line. “Good player. City wasn’t ever and will never be a team that wins games because of one player. They have a specific way to play and I think Erling will realise all of a sudden that he can score a lot of goals on the second post. He will love that. “There will be other situations where he’s a real beast. He’s been injured a couple of times at Dortmund but he’s a real beast. “Unfortunately, a really good signing,” Klopp told Sky Sports.
