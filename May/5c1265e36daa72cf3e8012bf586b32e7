The abducted Zamfara Radio producer, Comrade Idris Haruna Magami has regained his freedom. DAILY POST reports that Magami did not disclose the amount collected from him as ransom, but said he was treated kindly during the period he stayed in the bandits’ camp. He was abducted last Wednesday by unknown gunmen in Magami district of Gusau Local Government Area of the State. “They did not torture me, but treated me kindly as their brother. “I have been seeing many kidnapped victims being rough-handled by bandits. “They fed me and also allowed me to observe my five daily prayers, a privilege denied to many of those they have abducted. “I am grateful to many media outfits for their quick reportage of my abduction. “This has greatly assisted in my quick release from the bandits’ den. “I also want to use this medium to thank all those who contributed to my release,” he stated. He further commended the entire people of the State, especially the teeming listeners to his popular phone-in Hausa programme, called ‘Su duniya manya’ (The world is full of surprises).
