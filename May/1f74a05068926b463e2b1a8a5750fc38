Former Governor of Zamfara State, Hon. Abdulaziz Yari Abubakar has been arrested by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). He was arrested over his alleged role in connection with the N84 billion fraud involving the former Accountant-General of the federation, Alhaji Ahmad Idris. The former Governor, according to sources, was arrested at about 5pm on Sunday for allegedly benefitting to the tune of N22 billion from the N84 billion which the former Accountant General was alleged to have paid to one Akindele. The sources said that the EFCC also arrested one Anthony Yaro, who is the chairman and managing Director of Finex Professional – the company through which former Governor Yari allegedly benefited from the alleged fund. Recall that former Governor Yari had last weekend clinched the ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to contest for the Zamfara West senatorial election in 2023 into the House of Representatives. The Accountant General of the Federation, Mr Idris was earlier arrested over allegations of money laundering and diversion of public funds to the tune of N84 billion. He has since been suspended from office pending the outcome of investigations.
