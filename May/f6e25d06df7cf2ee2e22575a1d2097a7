Gunmen numbering about four on Sunday morning kidnapped Vigilante Chairman of Ukwulu Community, Kachy Ilodigwe, in Dunukofia local council of Anambra State. DAILY POST learnt that Mr. Ilodigwe was returning from church when the armed men double-crossed him with their car. A source who confirmed this said: “They then pointed a gun at him, shot into the air and put him into their car.” It is not yet clear why Mr. Ilodigwe was kidnapped. Ukwulu community has been volatile for some time now. Last month, a citizen of the community was clubbed to death in a farm land in what looked like a land-related issue. The Police Public Relations Officer in Anambra, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Ikenga Tochukwu when asked said he did not have any information about the incident yet.
