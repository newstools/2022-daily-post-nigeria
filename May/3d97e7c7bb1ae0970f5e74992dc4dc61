Another key player, Federico Bernardeschi is set to become the latest Juventus star to exit the club this summer, following on the heels of Paulo Dybala and Giorgio Chiellini in calling time on their career in Turin. Bernardeschi will leave Juve at the end of the season when his contract runs out, according to Football Italia. He had hoped to prolong his deal with the Serie A giants but has been told he is not part of the project for next season. The Italy winger will become a free agent from June 30 this year. Following a lengthy discussion, the player and club reached a mutual agreement that it was best to go their separate ways. Bernardeschi joined Juventus from Fiorentina in a deal worth €40 million back in 2017. He won a Serie A title and the Coppa Italia – Juve’s fourth-consecutive double. The 28-year-old went on to win another two league titles and more Coppa Italia while he was also a member of Italy’s triumphant Euro 2020 squad. Bernardeschi has made 182 appearances for the Bianconeri, scoring 12 goals in the process.
