An Akure Chief Magistrates’ Court sitting in Oke-Eda has sentenced two men to two years in prison for stealing 25 litres of palm oil and among things worth N435,000. The convicts, Yusuf Mohammed and Abdulahi Isiaka were said to have committed the crime at separate times in April 2022 at Alaga Erigi, Isarun, in the Akure Magisterial District. Tope Aladejana, the trial Magistrate, found Mohammed and Isiaka guilty based on circumstantial evidence presented by the prosecution. Three counts of conspiracy, theft of pumping equipment, two palm kernel processing machines, and 25 litres of Karumu Bamidele’s palm oil property valued at N350,000 were filed against the defendants. Oluwasegun Akeredolu, the prosecuting state counsel, informed the court that the convicts also conspired to conduct a felony in order to steal a TVS motorcycle worth N85,000. Furthermore, Abdulahi Isiaka was reported to have helped Yusuf Mohammed avoid punishment despite knowing he had committed a crime. The prosecution claims that the offence was committed in violation of Sections 383, 390(9), and 10 of the Criminal Code, Cap 37, Vol. 1, Laws of Ondo State of Nigeria 2006. The defendants admitted to the two counts of conspiracy and theft. According to Akeredolu, the court should convict and sentence the defendants based on their plea. C.B. Obilo, the lawyer for the convicts, begged the court to balance justice with mercy. He pleaded with the court to give them another chance because they did not waste the court’s time. The court found the defendants guilty of all charges and sentenced them to two years in prison without the option of a fine.
