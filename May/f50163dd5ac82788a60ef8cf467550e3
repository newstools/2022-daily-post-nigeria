Abdul Abiola, one of the sons of the late Chief MKO Abiola has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to investigate the circumstances that led to the death of his father. Abiola appealed to the President via his Twitter handle @AbdulMKO on Tuesday. He asked that Buhari look into Nigeria’s archives to reveal the truth, adding that it is time for Nigerians to know the truth about what led to the death of his father. According to him, the truth will help bring about justice. His tweets read: “It is time for the Nigerian people to know the truth as to what happened in the post-June 12, 1993 elections. “And also, what led to the death of MKO Abiola and Kudirat Abiola and other unsung heroes. “I urge President Muhammadu Buhari to look into our country archives for justice to prevail.” Recall that Abiola was the presumed winner of the June 12, 1993 presidential elections but his election was annulled by former head of state, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida. Abiola died under suspicious circumstances on July 7, 1998 in detention.
