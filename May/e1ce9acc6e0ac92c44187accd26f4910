The National Working Committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has dismissed the purported conduct of a 3-man Ad-Hoc Delegate Congress in Ebonyi State on Wednesday, May 4. The party said its congress will hold Thursday, May 5, 2022. PDP in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Hon. Debo Ologunagba on Wednesday, said the 3-man Ad-Hoc Delegate Congress in Ebonyi State held on Wednesday was null and void. The opposition party insisted that the purported conduct of 3-man Ad-Hoc Delegate Congress was unrecognized. It explained that Congresses are by law, subject to be monitored by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), which in this case, was not available to monitor the exercise. Continuing, the statement read “based on the unavailability of INEC to monitor the exercise today, Wednesday, May 4, 2022, the NWC rescheduled the conduct of the 3-man Ad-Hoc Delegates Congress in Ebonyi State for Thursday, May 5, 2022. “All members of our Party in Ebonyi State should therefore discountenance any exercise conducted on Wednesday May 4, 2022 as the PDP 3-man Ad-Hoc Delegates Congress in Ebonyi State will duly hold on Thursday, May 5, 2022.”
