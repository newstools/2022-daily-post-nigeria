The 27-year-old armed robbery suspect was with other members of his gang, who fled after sighting the police. Police said Oladele was arrested at Obasanjo Farm junction in Ota, with “a black bag containing two locally-made pistols, one live cartridge and assorted criminal charms.” The police spokesman in Ogun, Abimbola Oyeyemi, on Monday, said the suspect was apprehended after he was sighted by the police on a motorcycle conveying three men.
