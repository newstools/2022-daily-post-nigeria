Founder of Salvation Ministry, Pastor David Ibiyeomie has alleged that some Nigerian politicians indulge in many evil acts, including rituals, just to win elections. Speaking during a church service in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital on Sunday, the man of God argued that it is impossible to win an election in the country without spiritual power. While calling on Christians vying for elective positions to seek God, the popular pastor claimed that even the best candidates win elections without spiritual forces. He said, “Can you play politics and win in today’s Nigeria, I don’t know of other countries though, but can you win politics with a clear eye? Even if you are the best candidate, you can’t win. “You can have all the good English, it’s only you and your wife that will vote. The kind of people who are into politics, some of them pound children, some do sacrifices, some do all manner of things. You need supernatural force to subdue those forces”.
