The Labour Party gubernatorial candidate in the Osun 2022 guber poll has raised an alarm that his life is in danger. The former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives made this known during a press conference in Osogbo on Friday. Yusuf, who was twice a gubernatorial aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2018 and 2022, revealed that his campaign team and office had been subjected to several attacks in the last few days. He added that the latest attack that made him to raise the alarm was the one which was carried out by suspected political thugs on his campaign office on Thursday. “I received intelligence that some political opponents are after my life and it has been confirmed by the received threats. “I call on security agencies to be on red alert as politicians seem to be deploying thugs to attack other political opponents like me,” he claimed. The LP gubernatorial candidate, however, added that he had since reported the latest attack on his campaign office to the police and was awaiting their report.
