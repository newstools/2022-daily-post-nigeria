A non- governmental organization, Advocacy For Good Citizenship and Peace, AGCP, has called on the Nigerian electorate to vote for candidates based on their personal attributes and not for political party considerations. It also picked holes in the process through which Nigerian leaders emerge, alleging that it has caused lack of progress and development in the country. Barrister Kelechi Mbam, National Coordinator of the non-governmental organisation, said this at a public enlightenment in Abakaliki. It further explained that it was high time the electorate voted for credible leaders of their choice based on their person and not based on political party for the progress of the country. Also in a press briefing, Mbam disclosed that strategies and measures had been mapped out to sensitize Nigerians on the need to know what was expected of them, ahead of the 2023 general elections. He pointed out that voting behaviour would be mainly based on candidates who have impeccable character to uplift the living standard of the people. In his words, “We are all aware that our dear country, Nigeria, will go into the polls come 2023 to elect another set of political leaders ranging from State to National Assembly members, as well as governors of States.” But Mbam, who noted that as political parties have commenced the sale of nomination forms to elect their candidates, the electorate should be wary of dirty political activities capable of enthroning another circle of bad leaders into various offices. He added, “The issue of placing political parties above individual pedigree is becoming overwhelming in our voting pattern. “Na person, No Be party,” he warned.
