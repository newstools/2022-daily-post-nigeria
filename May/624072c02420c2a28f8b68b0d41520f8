Nigeria head coach, Jose Peseiro is happy with the level of commitment shown by his players and is convinced the team will do well under his tutelage. Peseiro officially took charge of the Super Eagles this week ahead of their friendlies against Mexico and Ecuador. The Super Eagles have failed to impress in recent outings despite the huge potential of the team. The team exited the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon in the Round of 16 and failed to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Peseiro, who was recommended to the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) by AS Roma boss, Jose Mourinho, has however promised to make the team great again. “I am encouraged by the players’ attitude and readiness to do well,” the Portuguese told the media. “They have shown good character and enthusiasm. “We will do our best in the games against Mexico and Ecuador. “The players have shown they are ready for greatness and to do well with the team. We will all put in our best to do well for ourselves, the team and the country.”
