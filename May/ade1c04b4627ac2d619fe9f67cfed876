Deji Aboderin, a former Senior Special Assistant on Public Affairs to ex-Governor of Oyo State, Abiola Ajimobi, has secured the Social Democratic Party (SDP) ticket to contest the Ibadan North East/ Ibadan South East federal constituency seat in the House of Representatives. DAILY POST reports that Aboderin emerged as the SDP candidate at the congress of the party held on Friday. The congress of the party was held at open ground, near the Orita Aperin Police Station in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. The congress had in attendance some of the national officers of the party, officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission and security agents. Our correspondent recalls that Aboderin contested for the position on the platform of All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2019. Aboderin, who spoke with DAILY POST after his emergence on Friday, urged the electorate to be guided as they exercise their franchise in the 2023 elections. He advised people of the federal constituency to vote for credible candidates. He explained that Nigeria is yet to get it right, because wrong candidates were fielded to run the system. Aboderin said, “The problem is that the electorate had been voting for wrong candidates. The right candidates are in the SDP. For Ibadan North-East/South-East, the right candidate is in the SDP.
