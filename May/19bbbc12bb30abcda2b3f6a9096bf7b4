Victor Oye, National Chairman of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), has distanced the party from claims by some individuals that there is a faction of the party, insisting that APGA has no faction in Anambra State. Speaking during an appearance on Arise News morning show, he said some people are only junketing and masquerading seeking to fault what they know nothing about. While responding to questions on the preparation of his party’s primaries, he said, “Our party is ready. We’ve submitted the lists of our officers from wards to national across Nigeria and we’ve also submitted the list of our members from all the wards in Nigeria to INEC.” He further explained that the party met the deadline and has submitted the list of its ad-hoc and statutory delegates, adding that the party also met the deadline for the House of Representatives, Senate and governorship. The party chairman described Edozie Njoku as an impostor, explaining that his role and attempts to obtain a forged judgment were sacrilegious. The lower court in Jigawa State had sacked Njoku as APGA’s national chairman, he also lost a suit instituted in an appellate court afterwards.
