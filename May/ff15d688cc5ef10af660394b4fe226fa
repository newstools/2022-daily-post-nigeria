The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, has disclosed why JAMB is yet to release the results of the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, UTME. JAMB Registrar, Prof Ishaq Oloyede on Tuesday, during a meeting with the National Youth Service Corps management and Registrars of Corps Producing Institutions in Nigeria, said JAMB is yet to release results due to internal appraisal. He stated that the examination body will not release results until they have reports of examination malpractices, adding that only 60% of results came in after the exams over the weekend. Oloyede said, “Yes, we have no reason not to release the results but we are also doing some internal appraisal. One, we do not want this situation where you release results and you start to withdraw some; so we have asked people to submit reports, particularly of malpractices. “And for the first day after the result was ready, we now scrutinized and we saw that about 40% of the report were not in. So, why release 60% and create confusion? We have insisted that this year, we will not release the results until we have all the reports of examination malpractices. He added that the results are ready “but we believe we need to have all the reports; we have about 70 per cent of reports now updated but we want 100 per cent. “The result will be out; for instance, I was told that the exam on Saturday is completed now. The results are in; when I get to the office today I’ll append my signature and it will go out,” Oloyede said.
