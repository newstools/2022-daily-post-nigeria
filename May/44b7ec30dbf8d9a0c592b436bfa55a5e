Aloy Ejimakor, the Special Counsel to Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has reacted to reports that the agitator may lose his British citizenship. The United Kingdom, UK, reportedly proscribed IPOB. This followed the announcement of new rules by of UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) policy, as disclosed by the British Home Office. The guidelines issued to decision-makers explained how to consider and grant asylum applications to Biafra agitators. The UK said IPOB and its militia, the Eastern Security Network (ESN), created in December 2020, “have reportedly committed human rights violations in Nigeria”. Reacting to the report, Ejimakor said the British Government did not denaturalize Kanu. Speaking with DAILY POST, Ejimakor said the report only made reference to IPOB’s proscription by the Nigerian Government. According to Ejimakor: “The news reports suggesting that Nnamdi Kanu will be denaturalized by Britain due to the revised British policy on asylum is false in its entirety. The revised British policy merely referenced Nigeria’s proscription of IPOB. It does not say that Britain has proscribed IPOB or declared it a terrorist group”.
