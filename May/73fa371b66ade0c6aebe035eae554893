An Ikeja Special Offences Court has dismissed the no-case-submission applications filed by two oil marketers charged with receiving $8.4million from oil theft. Yusuf Yaya Kwande and Osahon Asemota and their companies are being prosecuted by the Police Special Fraud Unit (SFU). The firms are Trafigua Behee BV, Trafigura PTE, Mettle Energy and Gas Ltd, Rembrandt Ltd and Jill Engineering and Oil Services Ltd. On Tuesday, Justice Mojisola Dada ruled that the prosecution had established a prima facie case against all the defendants. “There is a need for them to explain their role in allegations preferred against them by the prosecution”, Dada noted. The judge adjourned until October 4 for the defendants to open their defence. The SFU prosecutor, G. O. Balogun said the three-count charge include conspiracy and receiving stolen property.
