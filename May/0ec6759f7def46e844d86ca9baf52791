The Russian military on Tuesday said it has found the bodies of 152 Ukrainian fighters in the underground bunkers of the Azovstal steelworks it captured in Mariupol earlier this month after a protracted siege. Russian Defence Ministry spokesman, Igor Konashenkov in Moscow said, “152 bodies of fallen fighters and soldiers of the Ukrainian armed forces were stored in a container with no longer functioning refrigeration.’’ He added that Russian authorities had yet to receive any request to transfer the dead from the Ukrainian leadership. Konashenkov said that mines had been discovered underneath the bodies, claiming that the Ukrainian side had probably intended to blow up the container in order to frame Russia for the deaths. Russia and Ukraine have been fighting for close to three months. Russian President, Vladimir Putin, had ordered the invasion of Ukraine due to some political differences between both nations. As of today, many casualties have been recorded as a result of the war.
