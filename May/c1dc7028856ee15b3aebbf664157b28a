Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti has identified two players that would definitely play for his team against Liverpool in the Champions League final later this month. Real Madrid will face Liverpool in the Champions League final on May 28 in Paris. And Ancelotti has now revealed that both Federico Valverde and Rodrygo will feature in the final. The Italian shared his plans for their final against Liverpool in the post-match press conference after Real Madrid defeated Levante on Thursday. He said via Managing Madrid: “It should be a 4-3-3, which can sometimes shift to a 4-4-2. “There’s not a defined system. For example, against City, we started with a 4-3-3 and then I put Modrić close to Rodri and we moved to a 4-4-1-1, but the plan didn’t change too much. It can depend on how we want to press the opponent.” When asked if he would play Rodrygo and Valverde in the final, he said, “Both of them are going to play the final, definitely.” Rodrygo and Valverde have impressed greatly in recent weeks, especially in the Champions League. Valverde has started their last four matches in the quarter-finals and the semi-finals, while Rodrygo came on as a substitute in all four matches and scored three goals.
