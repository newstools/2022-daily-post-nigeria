All Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader, Bola Tinubu has endorsed Lagos Governor Sanwo-Olu and his deputy, Obafemi Hamzat, for another term in Lagos State. The public endorsement was witnessed by members of the powerful Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC). Others present at the Friday event were Lagos Speaker, Mudashiru Obasa, APC chieftains, state officials, party supporters, among others. Sanwo-Olu’s return had been under doubt amid rumors that a Muslim might get the 2023 governorship ticket. Some stalwarts had reportedly commenced ground work for two individuals. They are Head of Service, Hakeem Muri-Okunola and Mustapha Olorunfemi, a former Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Science and Technology. Today’s public declaration has now put to rest the speculations that Tinubu was against Sanwo-Olu’s second term.
