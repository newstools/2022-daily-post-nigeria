Former Liverpool and Chelsea stars, Jermaine Jenas and Karen Carney, respectively, have reacted to Mohamed Salah’s 32nd-minute injury in the Reds’ FA Cup final against the Blues. The first half of the entertaining final ended 0-0 with Salah suffering an injury as he applauded the Liverpool fans before leaving the Wembley pitch. The Egyptian was replaced by forward Diogo Jota on 32 minutes after going down off the ball. The Africa Cup of Nations finalist appeared to receive treatment to his groin before leaving the field. Jenas said on BBC One: “This is a big worry, Mohamed Salah is not the type of player who just takes a seat. “He plays a lot of games, a lot of minutes, he’s had a long season – I know most Liverpool players have but chuck the African Cup of Nations into that as well.” Ex-Chelsea player, Carney added: “When you see all the team mates around him, that’s when you worry. I think it’s his groin.” The worry over Salah’s injury for Liverpool is their Champions League final clash against Real Madrid later this month. In 2019, Salah was in tears when an injury forced him off in the 2018 final and now he has become a doubt for the final on May 28.
