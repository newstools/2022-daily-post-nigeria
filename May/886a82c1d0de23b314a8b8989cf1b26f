Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has revealed how former Governor Peter Odili’s decision to produce his successor in 2007 from Ikwerre earned him enemies, who betrayed him. Wike also asked Odili for forgiveness, insisting that he regretted that his Ikwerre people, who Odili fought for, were the first to betray him. The Governor stated this on Monday night during a State banquet organised at the Government House, Port Harcourt, in honour of Justice Mary Peter Odili, on her 70th birthday and retirement from the Supreme Court of Nigeria. Wike said: “Dr. Odili’s biggest problem in this State today, people must know the truth, is because he said Ikwerre man must become Governor, that is it. If any man tells you that Odili has committed any other sin, it is a lie. It is just because he said Ikwerre man must become Governor. “Unfortunately, we the Ikwerre people, whom he said should be Governor, are the ones that put him in the witness box. But, I want to appeal to him, forgive, you’re a Christian. You’re a Christian, forgive all of us.” He added, “I’ve never seen a man who has suffered humiliation, I’ve never seen a man who has suffered betrayal in life like Dr. Odili.”
