The Nigeria Police Force (NPF) will deploy modern and best technology to end insurgency and terrorism. Minister of Police Affairs, Maigari Dingyadi, spoke on Monday at a news conference on the country security challenges. The official noted that policing was no longer about the use of sophisticated weapons and other security gadgets. He said the deployment of high technology and techniques can achieve the desired goal of protecting citizens. “We are moving in that direction. The police is a civil institution and we’re not emphasizing these arms and ammunition. ”What we are emphasizing is that as civilians, we try to ensure that issues are resolved without having to use firearms or anything.” Dingyadi said countries are going hi-tech on security and that the Buhari administration is ready to do the same. ”We will make sure that the police have the best technology to fight these criminalities”, the minister assured.
