Adams Muhammed of an Ilorin Magistrate’s Court has ordered the remand of a 16-year-year old suspect, Afeez Ajakaiye for the alleged defilement of a six-year-old girl in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital. Police information report indicated that one Yahaya Issah, father of the girl, reported the matter at the ‘C’ Divisional Police headquarters, Oja-Oba, in Ilorin that he received a phone call from his wife alleging that the defendant Afeez Ajakaiye had defiled his six-year-old daughter. The police report further revealed that Issah’s wife met his daughter with bleeding from her privates when she got home. According to investigations conducted by the Juvenile Welfare Centre and Child Protection Unit, the defendant, aged 16 years, deceived the victim into his room and allegedly raped her under the pretence of buying her sweets. The Police prosecutor further disclosed that the doctor’s report also revealed that deep tear and laceration was inflicted on the victim’s private organ as a result of the forceful entry of the defendant’s manhood. The prosecutor then prayed the court to remand the suspect to serve as a deterrent to others who want to indulge in the shameful act. The trial magistrate acceded to the prosecutor’s request and remanded Ajakaiye in the correctional service centre in Ilorin.
