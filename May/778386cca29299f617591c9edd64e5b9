The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has given a reason for the sudden appearance of fuel queues in parts of Abuja. Over the weekend, queues resurfaced in most parts of Abuja which left motorists for hours at the filling stations. Speaking on the development, NNPC on its verified Twitter page said the resurfaced queue is likely due to low loadouts at depots which usually happen during long public holidays during the Sallah celebration. “Another contributing factor to the sudden appearances of queues is the increased fuel purchases which is also usual with returning residents of the FCT from the public holidays,” the tweet read. NNPC assured that it is working with the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) and marketing partners to ramp up loadouts from all depots as from today. NNPC assured Nigerians that there is enough petrol. “We have national stock in excess of 2.5 billion liters, with sufficiency of more than 43 days,” it said.
