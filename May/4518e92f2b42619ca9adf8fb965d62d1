Former Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has turned down the chance to join another Premier League club this season. Solskjaer was fired by United in November and has not been out of job ever since. VG reports the Norwegian has since received offers from across Europe to return to management. The clubs interested have remained unnamed, but one of the offers was from the Premier League. Solskjaer does not feel ready to come back and will instead wait until the summer before he takes on a new challenge.
