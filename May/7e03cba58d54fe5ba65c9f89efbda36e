Mary Yul Edochie has set the record straight regarding her husband’s choice of taking a second wife after he shared a video of them dancing together. Yul Edochie earlier today shared a video with his first wife dancing in the car which passed a message that all is now well between him and his first wife after he took a second wife. However, Mary, on her Instagram page said that the video Edochie shared was old. She noted that her family and faith do not support polygamy. Her post read: “I sincerely want to appreciate everyone for the tremendous love, prayers and support from all over the world. It has really been overwhelming. You have all been an incredible pillar of strength during this trying period. “My phones are buzzing once again due to the old video trending online today. My family and faith ABSOLUTELY do NOT practice polygamy, although it works for some people.” She asked that fans and supporters continue to pray for her and her family. “God has blessed me with a beautiful and loving family. I need you all to continue to keep me and my family in your prayers,” she wrote.
