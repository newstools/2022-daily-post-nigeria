At least four Nigerian players may be playing in the English second-tier after Watford was relegated on Saturday. They are: William Troost-Ekong, Emmanuel Dennis, Samuel Kalu and on-loan Oghenekaro Etebo. Wilfried Zaha netted the only goal of the Premier League fixture as Crystal Palace beat the Hornets 1-0 and sealed their fate. The defeat at Selhurst Park was their 25th of the season, enough to see them go down after only one season. The Hornets will be joined in the Championship by Super Eagles goalkeeper, Maduka Okoye. Okoye was signed in the January window and loaned back to Vitesse, who may also be relegated from the Eredivisie.
