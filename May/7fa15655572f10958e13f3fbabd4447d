The National Emergency Management Agency, NEMA, on Monday confirmed the recovery of two dead bodies from the Ebute Metta three-storey building collapse. The Zonal Coordinator Southwest, NEMA, Mr Ibrahim Farinloye, made this known to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Lagos State. Farinloye also confirmed that 23 persons have so far been rescued since the building collapsed. The recovered bodies were those of a mother and her child, while the rescued persons included 7 children and 16 adults. He added that nine of those rescued from the building alive have been treated and discharged from the hospital. “They returned to the scene, but have been taken away for proper custody while psycho-social and post trauma counselling are being arranged for them by the Nigerian Red Cross,” Farinloye said. Recall that the three-storey building collapsed at 24 Ibadan Str, Herbert Macaulay Way, Onyigbo on Sunday night. However, rescue operations were still ongoing at the site.
