The leadership of the Taraba State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has again reiterated its readiness to provide a level playing ground for all aspirants. The Party Chairman, Agbu Kefas who gave the assurance to all the aspirants jostling for positions on the platform of the party, also debunked the rumours making the rounds that the party has thrown its weight in support of some selected aspirants. Filing questions from newsmen at the weekend in Jalingo, he said the party has been democratic in its approach by throwing its doors open for all the aspirants to purchase nomination forms to contest for the positions of their choice. The party, according to him, is going to provide “a level playing field for all aspirants. So the speculation about an anointed candidates is not true.” Wondering why some few individuals have continued to spread fake rumours, he urged the aspirants to go about canvassing for votes from delegates in a peaceful manner, stating that ” if we have anointed candidates we wouldn’t have been so open and transparent.” He said, ” We allowed our people to purchase forms across the state and I was personally in Bauchi to ensure that all the governorship aspirants got screened and cleared to contest in our forthcoming primaries.” Insisting that the party has no special interests in any of the aspirants, he affirmed that “if I have a special interest, I would have done something there to disqualify some aspirants because there are so many reasons to disqualify aspirants.” Affirming that the party is solidly behind all the aspirants, he revealed how he worked tirelessly round the clock to ensure that all aspirants from the state are cleared. According to him “even aspirants who I didn’t see records of their dues, I cleared them all. So, we have been fair enough to all our aspirants. “
