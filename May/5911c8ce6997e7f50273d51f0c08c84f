Manchester United on Sunday, announced Ralf Rangnick will not stay on in a consultancy position. Instead the 63-year-old will face his new role with Austria solely. Rangnick was appointed as interim manager at Old Trafford in November but was unable to save their season. The Red Devils finished sixth, with their lowest points tally (58) in the Premier League era, and failed to qualify for next season’s Champions League. “We would like to thank Ralf Rangnick for his efforts as interim manager over the past six months. “By mutual agreement, Ralf will now focus solely on his new role as manager of the Austria national team and will not therefore be taking up a consultancy role at Old Trafford,” an official club statement said.
