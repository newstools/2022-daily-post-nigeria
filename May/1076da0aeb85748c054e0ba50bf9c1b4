Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has reacted to their 5-1 win over Everton on the Premier League’s final day. The three points was not enough for the Gunners, as Tottenham Hotspur thrashed Norwich City 5-0 at Carrow Road. Arteta’s men will now play in the Europa League next season. It is a huge disappointment, as his side were four points clear in fourth place with three fixtures left, before they lost 3-0 at Spurs. “We knew we needed a miracle and it didn’t occur. The league table doesn’t lie. “Last season with 67 points Chelsea had Champions League, with 69 we’re out of it,” Arteta said.
