European football expert, Andy Brassell has said that Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnic has not been given the opportunity to succeed in his job at the club. According to him, the German has been denied the necessary tools to succeed at Old Trafford, with his interim and consultancy job titles undermining his authority. Rangnick’s replacement has already been appointed, with Ajax boss, Erik ten Hag set to take over next season. The German coach was appointed on a temporary basis in November and would become a consultant at Old Trafford at the end of the season. However, his time at the club has not gone according to plan, with a low win rate of 40 per cent seeing United lose pace in the race for a top four. Brassell explained on talkSPORT, “He [Rangnick] has not been given the tools to succeed at Manchester United. “They have paid lip service to the idea of change under him, he was never given a real position of authority, he was interim coach, and not even sporting director but consultant.”
