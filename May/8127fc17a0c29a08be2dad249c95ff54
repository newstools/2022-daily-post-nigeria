The immediate past Minister of Transportation, Chief Rotimi Amaechi and a presidential aspirant under the All Progressive Congress (APC) has begged Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State to step down for him. Amaechi, who made the appeal on Friday night while seeking Kogi delegates’ votes ahead of the APC presidential primary, called on the delegates to prevail on the Governor, Yahaya Bello to step down his ambition for elderly people like him. The former Governor of Rivers State and his entourage, which included former Chief of Army Staff, Gen. Tukur Buratai said though Bello was qualified to contest for the Presidency, but he’s still young and should make way for him to become the Party’s flag bearer. “This is the 28th state I will be visiting. I can no longer be called one of the APC aspirants because I have become the leading aspirant. “I was Speaker at the age of 34, Governor at the age of 42, and a minister in my early 50’s. I have acquired the needed experiences to lead Nigeria. “I was a former chairman of Speakers’ forum, two term Chairman of Governorship forum, coupled with my interaction as Presidential DG campaign, I have what it takes to govern a country like ours,” he said. However, the Deputy Governor of Kogi State, Chief Edward Onoja, who received him, in his reaction, said that Kogi delegates were unanimous in their decision to back the State Governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello in his bid to become the next president. Onoja responded to Amaechi by saying, “I am sure you are aware that our energy, and vibrant governor is contesting for same position and we Kogi delegates have resolved to give our support 100 percent to him so that he can replicate what he has been doing in Kogi in the country.”
