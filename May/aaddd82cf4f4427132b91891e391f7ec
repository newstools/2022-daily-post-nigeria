Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti, has said both Eden Hazard and Gareth Bale could play in the Champions League final against Liverpool. Bale has not featured for the LaLiga champions since making a 16-minute appearance against Getafe on April 9. It was just his seventh match in all competitions this season. Hazard, meanwhile, has played once since mid-February having been given 26 minutes in their penultimate league fixture of the season. But Ancelotti told reporters: “Hazard is training well, he can play in the final, Bale can play too. “Everyone is motivated. Everyone can participate, whether it’s one minute or 10. It’s positive that everyone can do it.”
