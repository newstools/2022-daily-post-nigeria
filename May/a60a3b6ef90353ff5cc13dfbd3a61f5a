As reactions continue to trail Atiku Abubakar’s emergence as the presidential flagbearer of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), for the 2023 general election, a group, ‘PDP Frontliners Support’ said Nyesom Wike’s loss was a result of treachery. The former Vice President scored 371 votes to beat his closest challenger, Nyesom Wike who polled 237 in the PDP 2023 presidential primary election that was held over the weekend in Abuja. In a statement titled “Atiku’s victory, Wike’s resilience and the Treachery from Sokoto”, which was issued on Monday and sent to DAILY POST in Abuja, the party support group alleged that treacherous payback for Gov Wike’s past generosity towards a party chieftain from Sokoto State was the most significant factor in his loss to Atiku. They said Atiku Abubakar and Nyesom Wike’s joint ticket would be ideal in uniting the party in readiness for the 2023 elections. The Statement which was signed by the group’s President, Hussein Aliyu Mohammed, its Secretary, Mr Moses Taye Abidemi, and Publicity Secretary, Mr Dan Bruce Okafor, stressed that the Rivers Governor has paid his dues for keeping PDP as an active opposition political party, while others had gone asleep. They congratulated Atiku for cinching the ticket and Wike for being a second runner up, but lamented that if not for treachery, Wike would have carried the day The group said it was quite aware that Atiku has a wide network of friends but advised him to unite members of the party including those who contested with him to face the 2023 general election. “As for Governor Wike, an embodiment of formidable courage, unwavering party loyalty and pragmatic resilience without whom PDP wouldn’t have recovered itself after many had taken opportunities to exit and even fought with the ruling APC to destroy PDP,” they stated.
