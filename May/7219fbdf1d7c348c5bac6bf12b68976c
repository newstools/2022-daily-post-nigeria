Charles Soludo, Governor of Anambra State, on Saturday, paid a visit to the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu Soludo made this known in a post on his Facebook page on Sunday. He said he visited the IPOB leader to find a lasting solution to the issue of insecurity in the South-East. During the visit, he said Nnamdi Kanu decried the killing of innocent persons, kidnappings and all forms of criminalities. He also lamented the brutal enforcement of the senseless ‘sit-at-home’ perpetuated by groups claiming to be acting on behalf of IPOB. Soludo added that the IPOB leader promised to ‘personally’ prevail on his followers, through a broadcast, to maintain peace whenever he gets the opportunity to interact with them. “Together, we shall restore peace, security and prosperity in Anambra State and the South-East,” the Governor said.
