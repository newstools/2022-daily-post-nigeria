Chief Ebenezer Babatope, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has warned the party to allow fairness, equity, and credibility to prevail at the presidential primary or else risk losing in 2023. Babatope gave the warning in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday. The PDP is expected to hold its 2023 presidential primary on May 28. “Our great party, the PDP, must get it right at the presidential primary. We must ensure that the process is fair and credible so that we can have the best man as a candidate,” Babatope said. “If we want to defeat the All Progressives Congress (APC) and give Nigerians a better deal in 2023, we should do things the right way from the primary. “But if we fail to allow equity, fairness and credibility to prevail at the presidential primary, I’m afraid we risk losing in 2023.” The former Minister of Transportation also described zoning as an albatross to development, saying competence and capacity to deliver should determine the next president. He said that he would not advocate that PDP should zone the presidency to the North or South. Babatope said Nigeria was greatly challenged at the moment and that the next president must be brimming with ideas to fix the country’s problems. “Nigeria is facing so many challenges right now, and it is not going to be an easy job for whoever emerges as the next president. “So in 2023, we need a unifier; we need someone who can solve problems; we need a president brimming with ideas to surmount our challenges,” he said.
