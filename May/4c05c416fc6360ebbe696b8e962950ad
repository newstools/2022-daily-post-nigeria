Bishop David Oyedepo, Founder of the Living Faith Church Worldwide, has advised Christians in Nigeria to be united. Oyedepo spoke on Friday in Jos at the funeral of Rev. Isaac Oyebamiji, General Overseer, Chapel of Mercy. The religious leader said the progress of society depends on the unity and love of people of faith. Oyedepo said the challenges facing the country could be surmounted if Christians start speaking with one voice. ”It is high time Christians in Nigeria begin to speak with one voice”, NAN quoted him saying. “Nigeria is going through a lot because we refused to unite; we have refused to learn to live together. ”The unity of Christians is very important for the growth and development of this country.” Oyedepo described the deceased as a man of God who lived well. The Winners’ Chapel founder urged the family members to hold on to the legacies Oyebamiji left behind.
