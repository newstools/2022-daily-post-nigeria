Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has declared that he would not allow himself to be treated as a second class citizen in the country. Wike, who lost the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential primary election to the former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, spoke on Monday while addressing Rivers people after his return from the election held in Abuja. Lamenting the outcome of the election, Wike said the North should not claim ownership of the country, saying Nigeria does not belong to a particular geo-political zone. He said, “We have all it takes to do whatever we want to do. It is a matter of you to be fruitful. We cannot answer second class citizens in Nigeria. “We just used this one to tell them that enough is enough. We made them not to sleep, we made them not to eat, we made all of them from wherever they think they are coming from to know that there is somebody who can take them on. “This country does not belong to one particular zone. If people are afraid of talking, it is their business. I cannot be a second class citizen in my country. “They just want somebody they can control, somebody that will do whatever they want him to do, I will never be a party to that, they only people that can control me are Nigerians not the few people that want to remain in power since the military regime”.
