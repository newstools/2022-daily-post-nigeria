A former lawmaker representing Kogi West, Senator Dino Melaye, has reacted after losing the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ticket to serving House Representatives member, Hon. T.J Yusuf. There was a deadlock in the Kogi West PDP Senatorial primary election where Dino Melaye and TJ Yusuf scored 88 votes, which led to a rerun election on Tuesday. In the rerun election conducted on Tuesday, Hon. T. J. Yusuf defeated Sen. Dino Melaye by 163 to 99 votes to pick the PDP ticket Dino, while reacting, alleged that there was a gang up against him. He, however, thanked his supporters and congratulated the winner, Hon. T.J. Yusuf. Melaye on his Twitter page wrote: “The Primary has been fought and won. I congratulate Hon. T.J YUSUF and thank all those who voted in the first and second ballot for me. “The Gang up is unimaginable but l give God praise. God bless you all.”
