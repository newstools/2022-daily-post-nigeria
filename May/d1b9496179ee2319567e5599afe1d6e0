Halima who made this known on her Twitter page also alleged that some producers demand sex before giving actresses opportunities in their movies. The actress wrote: “I left Twitter not Nollywood. I produce my own movies. I no get strength for s3x. Taking a break is necessary.

I mean that’s me.” When asked by a fan, if producers demand sex before roles are cast in Nollywood, Halima affirmed. The fan had asked, “Serious!!
