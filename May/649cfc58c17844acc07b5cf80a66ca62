Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki has congratulated the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. The former Vice President won the party’s ticket Saturday night at the national convention in Abuja. Atiku defeated his closest rival, Rivers Governor, Nyesom Wike at a keenly contested primary election. Obaseki said the outcome again showed the PDP had enthroned a transparent internal democratic process. In a statement Sunday morning, he noted that what the leading opposition party achieved “is what our nation desperately needs for its much-desired rebirth”. The governor hailed other aspirants who submitted themselves to the race to fly the flag. Obaseki said the primary has portrayed the PDP as a worthy example to all political platforms in Nigeria. “The beauty of it all is that the party has put in clear display its maturity, strength and poise. “This is now the time for all aspirants and other stakeholders to pull together as we embark on this all-important mission to rescue Nigeria”, he noted.
