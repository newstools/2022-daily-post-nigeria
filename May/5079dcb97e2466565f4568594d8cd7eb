The Akwa Ibom State High Court has ordered the remand of one Prophet Godson Thompson, 32, in the correctional centre for allegedly raping a 13-year-old girl who was brought to him for intercessory prayers. The trial judge, Justice Bassey Nkanang, ordered the remand of the prophet, a native of Ikot Offiong Nsit in Nsit Ibom Local Government Area, after hearing the evidence of the victim, who is an SS1 student of a Government Secondary School in Uyo. In her evidence on Monday, the victim told the Court that while living with her elder sister in Uyo, her in-law took her to a church at Information Drive, Uyo, and when he left at about 6pm, the Pastor took her to his house, where she was raped all through the night. She said the accused person, a father of three children, gave her a bucket to urinate inside the house in order to prevent her from going outside. The minor also told the Court that the incident which occurred on Friday, July 10, 2020, saw her using her sanitary pads for two weeks because of bleeding. The tenager narrated that on the fateful day, the prophet told her that she should accompany him elsewhere to pray for somebody which she did, only to end up in his house, where he brought black liquid substance in a plastic bottle and drank before taking turns to rape her. She said she saw ladies’ panties of different colors and pictures of women inside the house of the prophet. The victim said she was able to escape when the accused person forgot to lock the door of the house and ran to a church where she was rescued. At the conclusion of the evidence of the victim, the trial judge, Justice Bassey Nkanang adjourned the matter to 1st August, 2022 for continuation of trial and ordered the accused be taken back to prison till the adjourned date.
