The New Nigeria People’s Party, (NNPP), is waxing stronger in Yobe State with the defection of a former federal lawmaker, Aliyu Yakubu Mainasara, alongside 128 into its fold. The defectors were mostly from the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and Social Democratic Party, SDP. One of the defectors and ex-federal lawmaker representing Potiskum/Nangere Federal Constituency of Yobe state, Aliyu Yakubu Mainasara, cited injustice, lack of level playing ground and confusion that are rocking APC in the state as some of the reasons that forced him out of the ruling party. Mainasara was a member of the House Representatives under PDP from 2011-2015, he later joined APC and now shifted his loyalty to NNPP with the hope of returning to the green chamber on the platform of his new party. Reacting to the development, the Chairman of New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP) Yobe State chapter, Alhaji Yakubu Shehu Damagum, said what is going on in Yobe State right from inception of democratic dispensation is an additional circle of those who have been in leadership positions. “We have a lot of youths in Yobe, what we are doing now as a party is to sensitize them about their future in our party. “We will give both women and youths the opportunity to participate in the new beginning under our party and we know that we will make a great party in Yobe State,” Damagum said. The NNPP Chairman also observed that most of the party’s members are youths and therefore have the strength to keep the party going for a longer time. “Most of the youths are from 35 years down and then women, who also make the greater part of our party,” he said.
