The wife of Lagos State Governor, Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, has warned Nigerian youths against committing bestiality. Sanwo-Olu said this on Wednesday at a special Eid-El-Fitr celebration at Lagos House, Alausa, Ikeja to mark the end of Ramadan. The media space has been filled with viral reports, videos of ladies allegedly sleeping with dogs for money. Some reports cited ladies in Lekki area of Lagos state as culprits. Sanwo-Olu said, “As we bask in the euphoria of this sacred celebration, it’s also important to seize the opportunity of this spiritual exercise to admonish our children and youths to shun all ungodly, immoral, and bestial acts. “As parents and guardians too, we must lead by example and pay closer attention to the totality of what concerns our children and wards. Sanwo-Olu advised parents and guardians to watch their wards and intrude into their privacy to keep them on the right path. “It is okay to intrude into their privacy and ensure that we guide them on the right path,” she said. Recall that the Police Spokesman, CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi warned that having any sexual act with dogs, animals is a criminal offence, warning ladies to desist from the act.
