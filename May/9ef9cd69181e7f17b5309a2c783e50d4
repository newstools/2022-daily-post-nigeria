Brazil legend, Cafu, has named Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold as one of the best right-backs in the world presently. Cafu said he has been following Alexander-Arnold for the past few seasons and his progress over the last few years has been amazing. Alexander-Arnold was handed his senior debut for Liverpool by Jurgen Klopp in December 2016. The England international has since established himself as a key player for the Reds, making 224 appearances across all competitions. The 23-year-old has been in fine form for Liverpool this season, helping the side’s quadruple push with his contributions. Alexander-Arnold has scored two goals and provided 19 assists from 45 matches in all competitions for Liverpool this term. “I have been following Alexander-Arnold and the campaign he has had at Liverpool. His progress over the last few years has been amazing and for sure is one of the best right-backs in the world,” Cafu, a former AC Milan defender, told BBC Sport. “He is young, strong and has developed hugely considering his age. He also has a lot of experience and I see a lot of similarities between him and myself.” “We both had a will and commitment to attack, to go forward and have the boldness to shoot and to put the crosses in. The diagonal movements he makes on the pitch are also similar to what I was making as a player.”
