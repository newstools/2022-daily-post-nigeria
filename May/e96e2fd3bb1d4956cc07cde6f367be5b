The Management of UNIOSUN Teaching Hospital Osogbo on Friday said it is not recruiting. The teaching hospital has asked the general public to be wary of scammers using its name to ask people to submit applications for Housemanship employment. The Public Relations Officer of the hospital, Ayodele Adeyemo on behalf of the Management in a statement said the purported advert is carried by a group link that calls itself “Nigerianinternspacel7″. The statement said ”the Management of UNIOSUN Teaching Hospital “notes with disdain a post widely circulating on different social media of a purported advert calling for interested candidates to obtain an application for employment into Housemanship placement of the organisation with a promise of letters of recommendations to interested candidates. “The advert is fake. It is an outright scam by some faceless people. UNIOSUN Teaching Hospital Osogbo is hereby affirming that it has nothing to do with the said advert. “UNIOSUN Teaching Hospital Osogbo has its own appropriate policies, guidelines and procedures for recruitment of personnel. ”The general public is hereby cautioned not to fall victim of these mindless impostors. Adeyemo stressed that the process has been set in motion with the appropriate agencies to track and bring to law the scammers.
