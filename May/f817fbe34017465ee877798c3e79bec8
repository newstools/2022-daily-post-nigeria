The Coalition of South East Youth Leaders, COSEYL, a youth group in the South East geopolitical zone, has rejected move by the Biafran Independent Movement (BIM) to support the presidential ambition of Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello. A statement issued on Monday by the President-General of the coalition, Goodluck Ibem alleged that the founder of BIM, Chief Ralph Uwazuruike had earlier disclosed that the group would support Bello to become Nigerian President in 2023. The coalition lamented why Uwazuruike who is agitating for the actualization of Biafra would endorse an aspirant from another geo-political zone. COSEYL insisted that the South East must produce the successor of President Muhammadu Buhari to allow for equity and fairness, stressing that the region had suffered marginalization enough. “2023 is the turn of the people of South East geo-political zone to produce the next president of Nigeria and it is not negotiable”, the statement added. COSEYL advised Uwazuruike to “continue with his Biafran movement struggle and leave the business and politics of the Nigerian state alone. Uwazuruike should know that he cannot serve two Masters at the same time. “There is no correlation between his group, the Nigerian state and the institution of the youths. He lacks the authority to speak on behalf of the youths and so what he said to Governor Yahaya Bello is purely his personal opinion on the presidency”.
