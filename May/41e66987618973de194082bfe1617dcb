The Lagos State Police Command has reacted to fears over motorcycle operators’ “plan to cause violence”. Ahead of the June 1 enforcement of the ban on Okada operations, the riders reportedly threatened to disrupt social and commercial activities. This is to protest the embargo on the use of motorcycles within six Local Government Areas. A statement on Monday by Police Public Relations Officer, Benjamin Hundeyin assured Lagosians of safety. He said the Commissioner, Abiodun Alabi has deployed human, material and operational resources to forestall a breakdown of law and order. Benjamin noted that a carefully drafted security architecture, resulting from a detailed crime mapping of the state, has been emplaced. “In addition, all Area Commanders, Divisional Police Officers and tactical commanders have been placed on red alert towards any eventuality”, he added. The security agency told residents to go about their lawful businesses without fear of harassment or intimidation. Meanwhile, a Show of Force has been scheduled for Tuesday. The convoy will move from the Police Headquarters in Ikeja.
