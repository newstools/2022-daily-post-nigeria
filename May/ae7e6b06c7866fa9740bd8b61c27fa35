Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has declared support for the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. Recall that the governor, on Saturday, lost the party’s presidential ticket to the former Vice President, Atiku. There have been speculations that Governor Wike may jettison the party’s interest by refusing to support the winner of the primary election. But shortly after Atiku paid him a courtesy visit in his Abuja residence on Monday, Wike said he had vowed to support anyone who emerged as flag bearer of the party. In a tweet on his official Twitter handle, Wike said he would be in full support of Atiku’s bid to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. He wrote, “I made a vow to the Official Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Nigeria that i will support whoever emerges from the #PDPPresidentialPrimaries and I am not going to go back on my word. “We cannot abandon the PDP, we will be fully supporting Atiku Abubakar”.
