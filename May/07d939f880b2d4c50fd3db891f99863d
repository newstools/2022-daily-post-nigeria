The Yobe State House of Assembly has distanced itself from a rumour that members of the Assembly were making moves to impeach Governor Mai Mala Buni from office. The House through its Chairman House Committee on Information, Gafo Mai Zabo Bizi, represented by his vice, Hon. Abdullahi Adamu Bazuwa, made the position of Assembly known on Thursday during a press briefing in Damaturu. The lawmakers also described the impeachment report as ‘false and malicious’. “The entire members of the house wish to categorically state that the above statement is false, baseless and malicious. “Members of the state assembly wish to condemn in totality the story published in an online news medium, entitled: “Impeachment: Governor Buni seals threat with automatic ticket to 24 Assembly members in Yobe”, as well as a video clip being circulated by one Mohammed Yakubu Lai-lai on the same subject,” he said. The lawmakers reiterated their continuous support and cooperation with Governor Mai Mala Buni for the respect and cordial relationship that have been existing between the two arms of the government. They, however, threatened to take legal action against perpetrators of such malicious publication.
