Oyo State government says it has suspended two health workers over the diversion of patients to a private health facility. The state government made this disclosure on Saturday. Chairman, Oyo State Hospital Management Board, Dr. Gbola Adetunji, who spoke on behalf of the government, said the two affected workers are a Medical officer and a Nursing officer. He said the two workers were involved in unprofessional conduct, which necessitated their suspension. Adetunji in a statement made available to DAILY POST in Ibadan on Saturday added that the two officials were suspended after a meeting of the management of the board. He said that it was discovered that the two people diverted a patient to a private facility for emergency surgery. He explained further that the suspended officers were petitioned by a relation of the said patient. He insisted that the management investigated the case and found the two people culpable. “The Oyo State Hospital Management Board has suspended two medical officers for diverting a patient to a private facility for surgery. “This decision followed an investigation of a petition received from an affected relation of the said patient. “Further investigation is continuing by the Disciplinary Committee of the Board. “Following the activities of the Monitoring Committees of the Ministry of Health and the Board and reports of members of the public, the Board had come to the conclusion that a few bad eggs in the state health sector are demeaning the good works of the majority of the public health workers. “The Board has had several interactive sessions with a cross-section of the health workers, emphasising drastic attitudinal changes in the course of their duties. “The Board is now sending a strong note of warning to health workers in the public sector to buckle up or face severe disciplinary action, as the leadership of the Board is migrating from counselling mode to serious disciplinary mode”.
