Outgoing Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, has penned an emotional goodbye message to the fans as he walks away from the club. In the statement, he thanked the players, staff and supporters of the Premier League club. The Russian’s 19-year reign comes to an end, with a consortium led by Todd Boehly having reached an agreement over a £4.25billion takeover. Abramovich also wished the new owners good luck. “As I hand over Chelsea to its new custodians, I would like to wish them the best of success, both on and off the pitch. “It has been an honour of a lifetime to be a part of this club – I would like to thank all the club’s past and current players, staff, and of course fans for these incredible years. “I am proud that as a result of our joint successes, millions of people will now benefit from the new charitable foundation which is being established. This is the legacy which we have created together,” the statement read in part.
