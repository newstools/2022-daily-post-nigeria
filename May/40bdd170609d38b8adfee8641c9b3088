Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand, believes Cristiano Ronaldo will be part of incoming manager Erik ten Hag’s Old Trafford revolution. Ferdinand said Ronaldo would be looking to do other things at Man United under Ten Hag. Ronaldo has been Man United’s main man throughout what has been a difficult season for the club. Having rejoined Man United from Juventus last summer, the Portugal captain was expected to be the catalyst for the Red Devils to go on and challenge for major honors. Ronaldo has held up his end of the bargain, scoring 24 goals in 39 appearances across all competitions this season. But Man United have struggled this term and will finish outside the Premier League top four with a game remaining. However, there have been rumours that Ronaldo may leave due to a lack of Champions League football for next season. But Ferdinand believes the five-time Ballon d’ Or winner will be a part of Ten Hag’s squad come next season. Speaking about Ronaldo’s future at Man United, Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel, “100 per cent. 100 per cent, I think Cristiano will be at Manchester United.” He added, “I have said it before, I think his legacy, leaving here, will change from what he expected it to be. And he will be looking to do other things and leave a long-standing imprint beyond his playing days here. I think that’s in terms of influence on other young players and helping set the culture. “The manager will help set that and I think he will want it implemented by particular players and Ronaldo will be one of them for obvious reasons.”
