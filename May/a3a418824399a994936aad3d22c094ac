Justice A. T. Mohammed of the Federal High Court in Port Harcourt has sentenced George Turnah to four years imprisonment. Turnah was former Special Assistant to Dan Abia, a former Managing Director of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). He was prosecuted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), between 2017 and 2022, for obtaining money by false pretence, money laundering and abuse of office. The ex-aide was jailed for failure to make full disclosure of his assets to the EFCC. The offence violated Section 27 (1) & (3)(a) of the EFCC Establishment Act 2004 and punishable under Section 27 (3)(c). Turnah was arraigned, together with his wife, Jennifer Tinipre Turnah, on four-count amended charges. Justice Mohammed found him guilty for non-disclosure of assets, but discharged Jennifer on the grounds that the amended charge was not served on her. Turnah was sentenced to two years each on counts 1 & 3. They were first arraigned on May 16, 2018 and re-arraigned on June 18, 2019 on four charges. Prosecution counsel, I. Agwu called several witnesses and presented several documents in court. Justice Mohammed said the prosecution established that the convict did not fully disclose his assets and sent Turnah to prison. The court found that he was one of the Directors and majority shareholder of Ashford Consult and Events Nig. Ltd.
