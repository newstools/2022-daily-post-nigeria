The President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo socio-political organization, George Obiozor, has reiterated the call for the release of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB. Obiozor urged President Muhammadu Buhari to consider a political solution in releasing Kanu and other detained Igbo agitators. He noted that such a measure would bring about healing, national unity and progress in Nigeria. Obiozor spoke while addressing Imeobi Ohanaeze at the body’s secretariat on Thursday, and was contained in a statement sent to DAILY POST. The statement reads partly: “In conclusion, permit me to express my profound gratitude to all those who made out time to attend this Imeobi meeting. “And to several others who sent their regards for their inability to be here physically present, it goes without saying that all Igbos must now begin to provide support to their Apex socio-cultural organization Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide. “I am confident that we will as a people survive and overcome the current challenges that confront us. I once again appeal to Mr. President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to find a way towards a political solution to the release of our son Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and other Igbo youths in detention. “We seek Healing, National unity, progress on a platform of Justice, Equity, Fairness and a sense of belonging in Nigeria.”
