Mr Yabaji Sani, the Chairman of the Inter-party Advisory Committee (IPAC) and National Chairman of the Action Democratic Party (ADP), has emerged as the presidential candidate of the party. Sani was declared as the ADP presidential flag bearer at the Special National Convention of the party on Tuesday in Abuja. Mr Tasiru Abdulrahman, Chairman ADP Electoral Panel, said that Sani was chosen by consensus. He said that Sani was chosen after he was screened and confirmed to have met all necessary requirements for the 2023 presidential election. “Based on the notice we gave out to all the chapters of the party, Sani uploaded all his personal particulars as presidential aspirant of the party on the party’s portal. “And he was screened successfully and the screening committee has submitted its report. “The committee’s report stated that the aspirant was able to meet the minimum conditions to run as presidential candidate of the party in the 2023 general elections. “And up till now, there has not been any other submission by anybody else to contest and based on that the convention is now requesting to ratify this very aspirant as the sole candidate running for the party,” he said. Responding, Sani appreciated the party for giving him the presidential ticket for the 2023 general elections. “The consensus is a great favour because if we go into 2023 without anybody to contest for president, our name will not be on the ballot. “And those who are familiar with the election process at that level will tell you that running for other positions without a presidential candidate is the fastest way to kill a party. “Because in the national discussion no mention of the name of the party will be made. “So that is why I believe it is a great favour we have done for our party and for ourselves,” he said.
