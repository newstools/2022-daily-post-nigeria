A University of Calabar lecturer, Dr Joseph Odok has cautioned that the current grievances by stakeholders in the Cross River State chapter of the All Progressives Congress, APC, could lead to a further division in the party. This he said could mar the chances of the party as they work towards the general election next year. DAILY POST reports that the party had set up a 7-man committee headed by former Senate leader, Victor Ndoma-Egba to prune the long list of 17 aspirants to four. This has brought about misgivings among the aspirants. Odok, in a statement Monday morning, appealed that “all aspirants for the various political offices in the APC should be given a level playing ground and any plan for consensus candidate should be totally jettisoned for the best candidate to emerge.” Addressing the leader of the party, Gov Ben Ayade, as well as State chairman, Barrister Alphonsus Ogar, he cautioned that, “any division in the party at this point will mar our chances in 2023.” According to him, “the courts are not friendly and the Electoral Act and the APC constitution have no provision for consensus in the way the party is foisting it on aspirants.”
