Lionel Messi’s father and agent, Jorge, has denied claims that the Paris Saint-Germain forward has agreed to join Inter Miami. Reports had earlier emerged that Messi will leave PSG when his deal runs out in 2023 and head to Miami to sign for David Beckham’s MLS club, while also acquiring a 35 per cent stake in the franchise. However, according to French publication Le Parisien, via TMZ Sports, Jorge has now branded talk of his son agreeing to join Inter Miami’ completely false’. Jorge is quoted as saying: “Leo has not yet decided on his future. And if Leo Messi has crossed paths with David Beckham in the last few hours, it is only as part of PSG’s stay in Doha where the former English midfielder plays a role as an ambassador for the next World Cup in Qatar.” Messi joined PSG on a two-year deal from Barcelona last summer. The Argentine captain has scored 11 goals in 33 outings for PSG this season.
