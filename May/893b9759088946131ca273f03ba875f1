Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti, has named Chelsea as the most difficult team they played enroute to the final. In the previous rounds, Los Blancos also eliminated Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City. But Ancelotti feels their 3-1 win in the first leg against Chelsea in the quarter-final, did not make them comfortable ahead of the reverse fixture in Spain. Madrid went 3-0 down at the Santiago Bernabeu before Rodrygo netted in the 80th minute to take the tie to extra time. Karim Benzema then scored to ensure the LaLiga champions progressed into the semis. “In all three rounds, I never thought we were out. The mental aspect was huge against Chelsea. “We had the advantage from the first leg, so preparing for the second leg was more difficult,” Ancelotti said at Real Madrid’s training camp in Valdebebas.
