The Delta State Police Command, led by CP Ari Muhammed Ali, on Sunday assured residents that there’s no sit-at-home order in the state. This is contained in a statement signed by the Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Bright Edafe. CP Ari, who was reacting to a Facebook post by some faceless individuals with the caption “Unknown gunmen Asaba Delta State sends strong message”, in which Asaba residents were warned to observe the sit-at-home order as declared by the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), assured residents of their safety just as he urged them to go about their lawful businesses, stressing that the Command is willing and able to deal decisively with anyone or group of persons who try to cause any form of trouble in the state. He admonished members of the public, particularly residents of Asaba and the entire Delta North district to remain vigilant, monitor and report any strange and suspicious movements or persons in their neighborhood to the command or other law enforcement agencies. Meanwhile, the CP in his determination to maintain the existing peace in the State, has placed officers and men of the command on red alert and urged them to remain watchful and deal decisively with anyone or group of persons attempting to cause any form of mayhem. He further directed the Deputy Commissioner of Police Operations, Area Commanders, DPOs, and Tactical Commanders to maintain Police visibility across the length and breadth of the state and emplace measures that will make the state uncomfortable and uninhabitable for any group of hoodlums. According to him, the command can be contacted through the following numbers; PPRO’s Office on +234 915 557 0008, +234 915 557 0007, Or the Command Control Room via +234 803 668 4974.
