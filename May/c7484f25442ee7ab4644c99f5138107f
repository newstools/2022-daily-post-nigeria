Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has appealed to the President of the United States of America Joe Biden, the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Congress of the United States of America to urge the Nigerian Government to take steps to stop Islamic extremists from succeeding in their alleged plots to cause religious war in Nigeria by killing one of Nigeria’s most respected Christian Icon- the Bishop of Sokoto Catholic Diocese Rt.Rev.Dr.Mathew Hassan-Kukah. HURIWA said under no circumstances should any harm come to Bishop Mathew Hassan-Kukah. The rights group said if the Department of State Services, DSS fails to arrest the identified Islamic preachers who made direct threats against Bishop Kukah, it should be taken as a message that President Buhari’s administration supports these threats. The group said the President is the Commander-in-chief of the Armed forces and the DSS operates at his beck and call. HURIWA said President Buhari would be held accountable should any harm come to Bishop Kukah for the reason many occasions the President’s Spokesmen have openly accused Bishop Kukah of undermining the administration. HURIWA said there is now a carefully choreographed wave of attacks by armed Islamists all over the country and especially in the North in such places as Borno, Bauchi and Sokoto States in which these extremists are now framing up Christian girls for the so-called blasphemy and these Northern States, allegedly in support of the mobsters committing crimes against humanity Specifically, HURIWA is worried that Islamic Clerics are making open and tendentious threats to kill Bishop Kukah only because he is a voice that condemns political corruption of the Federal Government and speaks out against all oppressive tendencies of government against not just the poor Christians of Nigeria but the entirety of the poor population in the Federation. “We are worried that on many occasions these Islamic Clerics have been heard and seen on videos that are going viral making open threats to kill Bishop Kukah but the DSS, the Police and all the armed security forces have feigned ignorance and even when their attention is called to these threats they do not take steps to arrest those issuing these death threats as if to say that those making these threats have the by-in and tacit support of the Federal government of President Muhammadu Buhari who has, in any case, failed to check the expanding frontiers of terrorism waged on Nigerians by his Fulani kinsmen since the last 7 years.” “HURIWA’S attention has been called to the video that has emerged of an Islamic cleric calling on his followers to ensure they kill the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Most Reverend Matthew Kukah This is coming days after some Muslim youths lynched a female student, Deborah Yakubu, for alleged blasphemy in Sokoto. HURIWA has, therefore, accused the security agents and the Federal government of conniving with armed and Islamic extremists to continue to issue threats against Bishop Kukah. The group alleged that the President had on many occasions insulted the respected Christian Leader for daring to criticise the bad policies of the current government which has plunged Nigeria into a state of heightened insecurity and a general climate of fear and reckless disregard for the sanctity of life.
