The Edo State Police Command has denied reports that 50 kids who were going for the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination were kidnapped in Benin. The state Command’s Spokesperson, SP Bello Kontongs, described the report as false and misleading. He urged Nigerians to disregard the report, adding that it is capable of creating panic. He stated, “The Edo State Police Command has been alerted to a misleading report making the rounds on social media, alleging that over 50 schoolchildren on their way to write UTME in Okada, Ovia North-East were kidnapped by herdsmen and this has caused confusion in the state. “It is important to state that the command under the leadership of CP Abutu Yaro has not recorded such an incident in Benin or anywhere else in Edo State. “To this end, the CP appealed the general public to be calm as the command under his watch will continue to ensure the safety of residents.”
