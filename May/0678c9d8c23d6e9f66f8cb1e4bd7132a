Former Aston Villa captain, Gabby Agbonlahor, has named his Premier League Player of the 2021/22 Season. Agbonlahor picked Tottenham’s Heung-Min Son as the player that deserves to win the Premier League Player of the Season ahead of Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah and Manchester City’s Kevin De Bruyne. According to him, there is no penalty in the 19-20 goals the South Korean international has scored in the Premier League so far this season for Antonio Conte’s side. Speaking on the player that should win the Player of the Season, Agbonlahor said on talkSPORT: “I know it might be controversial but Son. He’s scored 18-19 Premier League goals, no penalties, he’s been on fire. Left foot, right foot, smashing ’em in. “If I could vote for a player now for the Premier League player of the season, I’d pick Son.” Meanwhile, Son will hope to lead Tottenham to victory when they host Arsenal in a Premier League North London derby tonight.
