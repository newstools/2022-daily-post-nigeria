The Joint Admissions and Matriculations Board (JAMB) has released the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) results. A statement by the Head, Public Affairs and Protocol, Fabian Benjamin, said to check results, candidates need “to simply send a text message, UTMERESULT to 55019 using the same phone number that he/she had used for registration and the result would be sent. According to the statement, the Board has not uploaded results on its website for obvious reasons, saying the above process is the only way to check results for now. The Board, however, warned candidates not to fall victim to fraudsters in accessing their results through the process outlined. “Candidates are forewarned that they would, as usual, receive all kinds of messages from desperate fraudsters on how to check their results different from the aforementioned one. “Hence, the Board urge all candidates to ignore all such messages on how to check their 2022 UTME results as they are all products of deceit aimed at misleading them. “The Board, in line with its desire to adhere to the ease of doing business protocol of the government, has emplaced this user-friendly and simplified process of checking UTME results. “This simplified process would also serve to preclude the unconscionable exploitation of candidates by shylock business centres and cybercafes which often take advantage of hapless candidates,” the statement stressed. Recall that the 2022 UTME began on Friday, 6th May 2022 and ended on Friday 13th May 2022. Over 1.7 milion candidates registered and sat for the examination nationwide.
