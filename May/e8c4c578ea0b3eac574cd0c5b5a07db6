Former Liverpool captain, Steven Gerrard, has predicted the Champions League final between the Premier League side and Real Madrid. According to Gerrard, the Reds will win the game in Paris 2-0. He made this prediction in a video message on the club’s official Twitter account. Gerrard lifted the Champions League title with Liverpool in 2005. The current Aston Villa manager was filming from inside the Stade the France, where he was in attendance for Liverpool’s final training session before the grand final. “Hopefully it’ll be a fantastic game and I predict a 2-0 Liverpool win,” Gerrard said.
