Prior to the just concluded Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, primary election, the Leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, had on April 5 warned a former aspirant, Governor Nyesom Wike not to waste his money. In a statement issued by his media aide, Osho Oluwatosin, the popular clergy declared that the Rivers State Governor cannot succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. According to Primate Ayodele, Wike could only fit in as Vice President, urging him to drop his presidential ambition and support another aspirant. He said, ‘’Governor Wike cannot become the president of Nigeria, he should pursue a vice president slot, he should not waste money and energy rather, he should support a presidential candidate that he can deputize.’’ Speaking on Wike’s temperament towards other aspirants during his consultations, Ayodele warned him not to “shoot himself in the leg”, stating that all powers belong to God. However, Wike who believed he would clinch the party’s ticket for the forthcoming presidential elections, contested against former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, former Senate President, Bukola Saraki and others at the party’s primary. At the PDP’s convention held on Saturday in Abuja, Atiku was declared the winner with 371 votes while Wike, despite support from several governors, garnered 237 votes from delegates. Governor Wike, who is expected to complete his second term in office in 2023, is yet to announce his next line of action.
