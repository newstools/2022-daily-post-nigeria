Former Tottenham Hotspur star, Jamie O’Hara, has predicted that Arsenal will lose three of their final four Premier League fixtures. The Gunners currently occupy fourth spot, two points ahead of Spurs. Mikel Arteta’s men are favourites to grab the last Champions League place and have matches against Leeds, Tottenham, Newcastle and Everton left this season. But O’Hara told talkSPORT: “Arsenal will slip up. I think they’ve got tough games. I think we [Tottenham] have got one more tough game, and then it’s the North London Derby. That’s like a cup final which could go either way. “I just have to back Spurs, surely you have to back Spurs under the lights, at home, against Arsenal.”
