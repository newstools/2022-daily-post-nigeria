Arsenal legend, Paul Merson, has predicted the outcome of matches for the final day of the Premier League season. The 2021-2022 Premier League season comes to an end on Sunday with plenty still to play for at both ends of the table. Manchester City top the table going into their last game at home to Aston Villa, but Liverpool, who play Wolves at Anfield, are just a point behind them. Jurgen Klopp’s side are still chasing an unprecedented quadruple, having won both domestic cup competitions and with a Champions League final against Real Madrid around the corner. Arsenal legend Merson thinks the Reds will beat Wolves and also expects a win for City, which would secure the title for Pep Guardiola’s team, according to Sportskeeda. Here are Merson’s Premier League predictions: Crystal Palace 2-1 Manchester United Arsenal 3-0 Everton Chelsea 4-0 Watford Leicester City 3-2 Southampton Brentford 1-1 Leeds United Burnley 0-2 Newcastle United Norwich City 1-2 Tottenham Hotspur Brighton 2-2 West Ham Liverpool 3-0 Wolves Manchester City 2-0 Aston Villa.
