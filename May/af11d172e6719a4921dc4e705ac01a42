Former Kaduna lawmaker, Shehu Sani has revealed the only way the Southern region of Nigeria can produce President Muhammadu Buhari’s successor in 2023. Ahead of the 2023 Presidential election, several groups and well-meaning individuals have been clamouring for the South East to produce Nigeria’s next President. However, the All Progressives congress, APC, and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, are still undecided on where to zone the presidential ticket. Sani, on Tuesday, said the only way a Southern President can emerge in 2023 is if the major political parties produced their presidential candidates from the region. His tweet read: “Power will shift to the South only if the candidates of the two main political parties are picked from the South.” Meanwhile, the leaders of the regional socio-cultural groups, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Afenifere, and PANDEF, had accused APC of playing hanky-panky with the zoning of 2023 presidency to the South. The groups insisted that the Presidency must return to the Southern part of the country. However, the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) led by Prof. Ango Abdullahi, frowned at zoning of presidency, demanding that all major political parties should throw their tickets open to all sections of the country, According to them, “power shift arrangement is already dead and buried.”
