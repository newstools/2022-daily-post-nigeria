Governor Gboyega Oyetola Campaign Council for his re-election as Osun State Governor has condemned the attack on its supporters and journalists by some hoodlums loyal to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Gbongan. It accused the PDP of masterminding the attack, allegedly led by one Yinka Tailor. The condemnation was contained in a statement signed by the Director-General of the council and Senate’s spokesperson, Sen. Ajibola Basiru. The attack took place shortly after Oyetola left the campaign ground at Gbongan in the Ayedaade Local Government Area of the state. The campaign council said its intelligence gathering indicates that those who carried out the attack are known PDP supporters in Gbongan. “The PDP candidate had given enough notice that he was ready for violence. But we have better things to offer the state, that is why we have been marketing our candidate in a most peaceful and responsible manner. And as we all know, our candidate, Mr Governor is a peace-loving man and will not encourage any action that can jeopardise the peace we enjoy in the state,” Basiru said. “They had their state and National Assembly primaries on Sunday, it was characterised by violence and attacks. We never knew they would extend the same to us on Monday. We were done with our campaign. Our candidate had left the place, the rest of us were leaving when they launched the attack. “We have it on good authority that one Yinka Tailor of Arapajo Street, in Gbongan, a known PDP supporter led the attack on our people and the journalists in our convoy.”
