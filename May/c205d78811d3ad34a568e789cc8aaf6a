Reno Omokri, a socio-political activist has suggested why the North would obey President Muhammadu Buhari’s direction that the region should vote for Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in 2023. Omokri claimed that Buhari has 12 million Northerners who would follow his command on voting Tinubu in 2023. To this end, the former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan warned the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, against fielding a Southerner in 2023. In a tweet, Omokri urged the PDP to field a Northern candidate for the party to stand a chance of returning to power. He wrote: “Buhari has always had a captive audience of 12 million Northerners. “If PDP fields a Southerner in 2023, his 12 million captive audience will obey Buhari’s command to vote for Tinubu. And he will win. The only way they won’t obey him is if the PDP fields a Northerner!” Buhari is yet to declare his support for any of the Presidential aspirants. Recently, the President said he would not disclose his preferred candidate because he may be assassinated. However, there are indications that Buhari may support the candidature of Rotimi Amaechi, the Minister of Transportation.
