Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi has stated that the elite are the problem of Nigeria. He advised citizens to vote the right people into leadership positions to fix the country’s challenges. Amaechi gave the counsel on Tuesday at the 2022 World Press Freedom Day celebrations in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital. The former Rivers Governor also urged Nigerians to always hold politicians accountable. “The problem of the country is not the poor man in Akwa Ibom or Rivers, in the South East or in the North. It is you and I, the elite,” he said. NAN reports that Amaechi also dropped his take on the controversial issue of restructuring. “Why you are hearing restructuring, it is because the elites’ consensus on sharing (the resources) is disappearing. “It is because there is nothing to share again, we are broke. The problem facing this country is caused by the elites, including you”, he said. Amaechi urged the media to help resolve the nation’s problems through objective, balanced and fair reportage.
