Four-time NBA champion, LeBron James, has predicted the scoreline for the UEFA Champions League (UCL) final between Liverpool and Real Madrid. Liverpool will clash with Real Madrid in the Champions League final in Paris on May 28. The Premier League giants eliminated Villarreal in the Champions League semi-final a few days ago. Real Madrid, meanwhile, knocked Manchester City out of the competition. In a Q&A session on Twitter, James, a Reds fan, was asked about his prediction for the Champions League final, to which he replied: “4-3 US!!!! YNWA”. This comes less than two weeks after James hailed Jurgen Klopp’s side for qualifying for the Champions League final.
