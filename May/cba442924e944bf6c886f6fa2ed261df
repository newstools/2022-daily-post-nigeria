The Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, has lashed out at the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government for blocking the phone lines of Nigerians over the NIN-SIM policy. Giwa, who fumed at the decision, said the move was not a smart one from the government, particularly that insecurity has continued unabated in the country. Buhari had on April 2, 2022 approved the implementation of the NIN-SIM policy which restricts calls on any SIM not linked with NIN. Pointedly, the fiery pastor maintained that if the government is serious about securing lives and property of the Nigerian people, surveillance cameras ought to have been set up across the country instead of blocking people from speaking to their loved ones. Speaking on Sunday in Akure, the Ondo State capital, Giwa, noted that those giving the President advice lacked the technical skills for such a move. “It is senseless to block over 72 million Nigerians from making calls to their loved ones. “President Muhammadu Buhari has again demonstrated to the world that he is incompetent to lead a nation. “How much will it cost the government to install CCTV cameras across the country? President Buhari or whoever that advised him to make such a decision lacks technical skills. “Is it not possible for someone to walk into a registration center with fake information and enroll for NIN? “Since they made that poor decision, has it stopped insecurity in Nigeria? Then, what is the purpose of blocking the sim cards of innocent Nigerians? The Scripture says in James 1: 5 that ‘he who lacks wisdom should ask God. “These leaders lack wisdom because their hearts are far away from God.”
