UEFA has banned Russian clubs from playing in the Champions League and other European club competitions next season. The football governing body confirmed this in a statement on Monday. “Russia will have no affiliated clubs participating in UEFA club competitions in the 2022/23 season,” it read. In February this year, Russian clubs and national teams were suspended “until further notice” by UEFA, following the country’s invasion of Ukraine. The Russian team’s exclusion from the Women’s European Championship to take place in England in July was also confirmed on Monday. Portugal, who had lost to Russia in a qualifying playoff, will take their place in Group C alongside 2019 World Cup runners-up Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. UEFA also announced that Russia’s bid to host either the 2028 or 2032 European Championship is “not eligible”.
