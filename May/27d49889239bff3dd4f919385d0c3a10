The Coalition of South East Youth Leaders, COSEYL, has said they will not accept having former Anambra State governor, Peter Obi as a vice to a northern candidate in the 2023 presidential election. Recall that Obi, a presidential aspirant under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, on Wednesday resigned his membership of the party. The former aspirant, who alleged irregularities in the party’s election processes, also announced his withdrawal from the presidential race ahead of the primary election scheduled for May 28. His followers, who were angered by the development, had vowed to join him in any political party the former governor would choose in place of the major opposition party, PDP. Reacting, in a chat with DAILY POST on Friday, the president-general of COSEYL, Goodluck Ibem said they are currently observing Mr Obi to see his next move. According to Ibem, the Southeast youths who were mobilizing support for Obi prior to his resignation would be okay with his decision only if he (Obi) picks the presidential ticket of another party. He said, “We are currently watching to see his next line of action. If he picks the presidential ticket of another, we are ok with it. “What we will not accept is for him to leave PDP to become a VP to a northern presidential candidate”.
