Former Leeds United striker, Noel Whelan, has hit out at Manchester United forward, Marcus Rashford. Whelan said he doesn’t know who Rushford is anymore, urging the England international to get out of Man United once the summer transfer window starts. According to him, the 24-year-old doesn’t look like a player that is going to complement anybody at Man United, adding that he looks like neither a centre-forward nor a wide forward. Rashford has endured a difficult season at Man United so far, having only contributed five goals and two assists in 32 games across all competitions for the Red Devils. “Right now, when I look at Marcus Rashford, he doesn’t look like a player that is going to complement anybody. It’s just been such a bad season at Man United,” Whelan told Football Insider. “Where does he play? Is he a wide player, is he a centre-forward? The conversation was on Thursday night with Roy Keane and I think he’s absolutely right. I don’t know what he is.” Whelan added: “I’m not entirely sure where Rashford’s best position is. Right now, we are not seeing the Rashford we saw two years ago. That is the problem, he needs to get his mojo back.” “He needs a change. I think he needs to get out of that football club whether a new manager comes in or not. He definitely needs to move.”
