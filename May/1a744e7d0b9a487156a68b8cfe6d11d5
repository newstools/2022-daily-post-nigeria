Anambra State Governor, Prof Chukwuma Soludo, has said that the killing of Hon Okey Okoye, a member of the State House of Assembly was meant to test his resolve. Soludo, in a post he made on his verified Facebook account, however, stated that the killers will never go unpunished. Hon. Okechukwu Okoye, popularly known as Okey dị Okay, who represents Aguata II State constituency, and his aide, Cyril Chiegboka were last weekend kidnapped and later murdered and beheaded. In the post, Soludo said: “No human being should ever have to experience death in that way. For no just reason, rampaging criminals have elected to desecrate our land with the blood of the innocent. “This is a test of our resolve, and we are more emboldened than cowed that this criminality must be stamped out of our land. The party is over, and every community must brace up to join forces with government in this war to reclaim our homeland. “Okey and Cyril will never die in vain. May God console their young families, the people of Isuofia and ndị Anambra. May their souls and all others who have lost their lives in the hands of these criminals continue to rest in peace,” he said. The governor had earlier announced a have placed a ten million N10,000,000 bounty on the heads of the killers for anyone with useful information on the killers.
