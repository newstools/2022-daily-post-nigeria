Incoming Manchester United manager, Erik ten Hag has spoken about two Ajax players Jurrien Timber and Antony, who are linked with a move to Old Trafford. Ten Hag is said to be plotting to bring the players along with him to Manchester United. Erik ten Hag is expected at Manchester on Monday, (today) to get a head start on his new job. Far from playing down the speculation linking the Timber and Antony to Old Trafford, Ten Hag has fuelled the noise even further and feels both players are destined to join a top club. “I think that all top clubs in Europe have Timber in their sights,” Ten Hag told De Telegraaf. “But I think that currently applies to a lot of Ajax players. “If Antony were to go, it would be a loss for Ajax, because you have no one in the current selection who can take over his position. He is top class.”
