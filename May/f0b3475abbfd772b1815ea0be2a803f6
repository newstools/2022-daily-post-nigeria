Former Real Madrid player, Steve McManaman has stated that he is backing Manchester City to pip the Reds to the Premier League title. McManaman represented both Man City and Liverpool during his playing days and now works as a commentator and pundit. Man City are currently on top of the Premier League table with just one point ahead of Liverpool ahead of Sunday’s Premier League final day fixtures. Pep Gurdiaola’s side will face Aston Villa, while the Reds will host Wolves. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, the former midfielder shared his thoughts on the title race, saying: “Yes, I think Liverpool will go and beat Wolves because they are not in the greatest of form, and they will be on a high and the stadium will be rocking. “But I just can’t see Manchester City doing anything but winning themselves, to be very honest. “I think Liverpool will do the business and then roll onto the Champions League next week, but I can’t see past (Manchester City).”
