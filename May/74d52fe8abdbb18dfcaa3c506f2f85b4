Former Manchester United defender, Rio Ferdinand, has said it will take time for Erling Haaland to adapt at Manchester City. City have completed the £51million transfer of the 21-year-old from Borussia Dortmund. Haaland arrives in England after netting 86 goals in 89 games for the Bundesliga side in all competitions during his three years at the club. However, Ferdinand has warned Haaland that he will need a “bedding-in period” at the Etihad, like Jack Grealish and others before him. He said: “There could be a bedding-in period where we don’t see the Haaland we expect to see immediately. “What Pep’s had with City when big players have come in, they get a bedding-in period. It’s an understanding: this is hard, you don’t hit the ground running all the time. “The biggest part of that is the humility of the players that struggle. They don’t moan and kick up a fuss. That’s where Haaland has to play his part if it doesn’t go right. Suppress any ego… the bigger picture is not disturbing the morale of the squad.” —
