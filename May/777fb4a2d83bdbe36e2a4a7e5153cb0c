The council chairman of Sardauna Local Council of Taraba State, Oliver Wubon, has again raised the alarm over the massive presence of kidnappers in his domain. The chairman, who made this known to newsmen on Thursday in Jalingo, the state capital, said kidnappers in the area are currently going about demanding advance payment from people or risk being kidnapped. DAILY POST reports that activities of kidnappers in the Mambilla Plateau area of the state, have not only crippled business activities in the council, but will as well go a long way to frustrate the take off of the Mambilla Hydro Power Project. Beckoning the government at all levels to immediately wade in, Wubon lamented that kidnappers operating in the area are threatening people to make advance payments either into certain accounts or cash. The council boss, who went ahead to admonish the government to swift into action, the dream of ensuring bumper harvest, he said will be a mirage if urgent steps were not taken to frustrate the kidnappers activities. Stressing how the situations have been hampering farming activities within the area, the need for the government to be proactive so as to avoid impending hunger within the local government, he said, has become necessary. According to him, “The banditry activities in Sardauna Local Government is now something else. Kidnappers are now asking for advanced payment from people or risk being kidnapped.” Wondering why positive measures have not been put in place to arrest the situation, the kidnappers, as stated by him, are calling people to make payment either into certain accounts or cash. “Our people are living in fear, we no longer go to the farm, the possibility of impending hunger is now clear in the area if not immediately checked.”
