Real Madrid star, Rodrygo, has responded to football icon Pele’s message by thanking the Brazil legend for his kind words. DAILY POST had reported that Pele sent a congratulatory message to Rodrygo on Thursday for his man-of-match-display during Real Madrid’s Champions League semi-final second leg victory against Manchester City on Wednesday. Pele said Rodrygo is enlightened, adding that the Brazilian youngster brought joy to him as he knew the day would come that he would congratulate his compatriot. Replying to Pele’s message, Rodrygo wrote on Instagram, “Thank you for your words, King. “I will never forget your words of advice and I am eternally grateful to you.” Recall that Rodrygo came from the bench for Real Madrid to score two late goals against Man City to take the tie to extra-time, before Karim Benzema sealed the victory for the LaLiga champions. The match ended 3-1 in favour of Carlo Ancelotti’s men, as they qualified for the Champions League final on a 6-5 aggregate win over the Premier League champions. Real Madrid will now face Liverpool in the Champions League final on May 28 in Paris.
