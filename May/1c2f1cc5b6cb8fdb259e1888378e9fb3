A chieftain of the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has charged the government to stop the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) from attacking, killing and destroying people’s property. Musa Saidu, ACD chieftain in a statement on Saturday noted that IPOB activities were getting out of hand as “many innocent people are being attacked daily in the South-East and nobody is saying anything. According to him, “We have documentary evidence on killings across the South-East from 1992. Most of the victims are our people, the security agencies are aware of this.” He lamented the gruesome murder of Fatima Jubril and her children last Sunday by suspected IPOB members, stressing that she was killed for no reason. He advised the Anambra government to pay compensation to her family and ensure that the killers were apprehended and made to face the wrath of the law. The ACF chieftain stated that President Muhammadu Buhari’s condemnation was not enough, insisting on a decisive action to prevent reprisals. Saidu explained how the Arewa community in the South had lodged several complaints on persistent IPOB attacks without any response by constituted authorities. He noted that in spite of condemnation from the Northern Governors’ Forum, the Sultan of Sokoto and some eminent elders, the situation had continued unabated.
