The Governor of Bauchi State and Presidential aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Bala Mohammed has announced that he is prepared to accept the decision of the party in whosoever emerges as its presidential standard in the 2023 general elections. Bala said this shortly after meeting with Niger State delegates at the party Secretariat in Minna, He explained that the discretion of the party on the matter is supreme and must be followed by contenders. “As a democrat, it is not a do or die affair. The party is supreme and its decision must be obeyed. I am ready to abide by the leadership discretion. Though, I am presenting myself before the party elders, members and Nigerians for them to make their decision on who will lead them,” the aspirant insisted. Mohammed also noted that the zoning arrangement in operation in PDP is not a problem, but a formula to bring dissolution of power between the federating units to ensure equity and justice that is commendable. “I am a general in politics and nothing is wrong with having plans B and C because I always have plans not only for myself but for my followers, campaign directors and others as well,” he maintained. The governor further emphasized that “zoning is in the party constitution which was deliberately aimed at ensuring peace, equity and justice. It must be abided by members who believe in the supremacy of the party”.
