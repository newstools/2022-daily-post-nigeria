Ahead of the 2023 Presidential election, the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, PFN, has warned against a Muslim-Muslim ticket. National President of PFN, Wale Oke, said Christians would vote against any political party that fielded a Muslim-Muslim ticket in 2023. Speaking at the 30th anniversary of the PFN establishment in Osun State on Saturday, Oke said President Muhammadu Buhari should hand over to a Christian in 2023. He stressed that it would be “unfair” for Buhari to hand over to another Muslim. A statement by Osun PFN Director of Media, Bishop Seun Adeoye, quoted Oke as saying, “The Church in Nigeria is saying no to a Muslim-Muslim ticket. We are going to mobilise the church against such a political party. PFN has 65 million people and we will vote against such a party. “Obasanjo handed over to Yar’adua, Yar’adua to Jonathan, and Jonathan to Buhari and who else should Buhari hand over to, but a Christian.” Oke also urged PFN members to collect their Permanent Voters’ Cards, PVC.
