Nick Cannon has revealed that he is considering getting a vasectomy after welcoming eight children with 5 different women. The 41-year-old, who is expecting his ninth child with girlfriend Brie Tiesi said this to E! News’ Daily Pop. According to him, although he’s blessed with the gifts of children and finds solace in them, he’s not looking to populate the earth. Nick Cannon said: “I already went and got my vasectomy consultation. I am not looking to populate the earth completely, but I’m definitely looking forward to taking care and loving all the children that I currently have.” When asked if he really wanted to have so many children or it’s just a coincidence, he said: “I don’t know if I would have designed it this way, but it’s one of those things when you’re blessed with the gifts of children and as we all know, I have been through so much, I find solace, I find peace and purpose in my children, so I’m not out here looking.” Recall that Cannon had a son named Zen, with Alyssa Scott, but he sadly died in December 2021 at 5 months from brain cancer.
