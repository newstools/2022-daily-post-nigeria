Senator Magnus Abe has explained his reasons for supporting the presidential ambition of former Lagos State Governor, Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Abe said having looked at other aspirants, it is only Tinubu that can win the presidential election for the All Progressives Congress, APC, after President Muhammadu Buhari. He was speaking during a rally in Port Harcourt on Thursday. Abe, who is also a Rivers State governorship aspirant, said his support for Tinubu was not based on any sentiment but because he wants to be part of a winning team. He said, “the reason I am supporting him is simple. I looked at all who want to run, who claim they have done this and that and I saw that Asiwaju is the person in APC that can deliver that killer punch that will keep the party in power after Buhari. “I was not being sentimental, he did not tell me he was going to support me, no. I support him because I want the party to win. “I know I cannot afford to be in the periphery of the government in the next 8 years.” Speaking on Rivers politics, he called on his supporters to ignore the call for a Riverine or upland governor, saying it was only a ploy to deny Ogoni people the governorship position.
