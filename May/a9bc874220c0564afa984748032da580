Reno Omokri, former media aide to Nigerian ex-president, Goodluck Jonathan has claimed that the Yorubas are the most successful tribe in the country. Omokri who made the claims in a post on his verified Facebook page on Monday, said the fortunes of Yoruba people are tied to their rich culture, particularly the respect and honour they display to their parents. According to him, many Yoruba billionaires such as the business guru, Femi Otedola always prostrate when they greet their parents unlike other tribes in Nigeria and other parts of the African continent. He said, “The reason why the Yorubas are the most successful ethnic group in Nigeria, and perhaps in Africa, can be traced to their respect and honour for their parents. I have never seen a race that respects parents like the Yorubas. “You can’t marginalise people who maximise their parents! A billionaire Yoruba man, like Femi Otedola, will see his father and prostrate for him. “When a people honour their parents that much, there is no way God will not exalt them individually and as a race. If you are looking for the secret of their success, look no further!”.
