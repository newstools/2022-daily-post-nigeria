The Glazer family, owners of Manchester United, are in talks to buy Indian Super League side East Bengal, according to Indian cricket legend Sourav Ganguly. East Bengal are currently without investment after their association with Shree Cement Limited came to an end last month. The Kolkata club, who play in the country’s top flight, are believed to now be in a perilous position. Ganguly, who is the president of Board of Control for Cricket in India, speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, said: “Yes we have spoken to them and others also. “It will take 10 to 12 more days to know who will be the entity.” When asked whether United are coming as an investor, Ganguly clarified: “No no, as an owner.” Ganguly is helping the Glazer family to oversee the deal. East Bengal endured a miserable 2021/2022 campaign in the ISL, finishing bottom with just one win from 20 regular season matches.
