The newly-appointed Niger State Coordinator of Nigeria Midstream Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), Ahmed Emimaru, has called on marketers to desist from selling above the regulatory price of product in the state. Emimaru made this known during a meeting with the officials of the state Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria, IPMAN, Minna. He explained that to ensure strict compliance, the authority will conduct more monitoring and surveillance as frequently as possible in the state. In his response, the chairman Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria, Minna, Adamu Ahmed Erena, noted the need for harmonious working relationship between the authority and his members devoid of witch hunting. He lamented that the owners of private depots were their major challenge as they sell above the official price currently. He then appealed to the authorities to intervene by compelling them to comply with the policy to ensure quality service delivery to the people and nation. Earlier at a maiden meeting he held with newly deployed workers to Minna office of NMDPRA, Emimaru warned them not to be found wanting in anything that will undermine the organization. He also advised the worker on the need to respect the organizational procedure in carrying out their responsibilities to enhance development to ensure better results.
