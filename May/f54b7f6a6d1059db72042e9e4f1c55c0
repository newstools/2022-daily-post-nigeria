Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand has hit out at interim manager, Ralf Rangnick over his latest comment on the club’s board rejecting his request to sign a striker late in the January transfer window. Rangnick had during his pre-match press conference before Man United’s humiliating Premier League 4-0 defeat to Brighton on Saturday, spoken publicly about the club’s board not signing players in January, such as Luis Diaz, Dusan Vlahovic and Julian Alvarez. But Ferdinand has now called out Rangnick for putting out too much information in his press conferences, insisting that what he did was not right. According to the former England center-back, some things need to be kept private, and the German should not inform the media of inside issues. Speaking on his FIVE podcast, Ferdinand said, “When I hear the manager speaking, we have never been a club that airs its dirty laundry in public. The guy is talking about details which should be kept within the club; ‘I tried to tell the board to sign this player or that player’. Talk to the board. Don’t talk to the public.” “If you are going to talk about that, if you have left the place and you have severed ties with the club, maybe that is when you want to talk about it. Fine. I understand that, maybe. You can get a few things off your chest… but you are still there working; ‘I told them to sign these three players, [Luis] Diaz at Liverpool who is now flying’.” “It makes him look a bit better and takes the responsibility off him. I don’t think it is right what he is doing. Yeah, you are disappointed, of course, but speak about [those things] and iron it out at the club. When you are gone, then you can say your piece, maybe. Doing it when you are there right now doesn’t help anybody.”
