A Peoples Democratic Party, Presidential aspirant, Atiku Abubakar, on Friday disclosed the biggest challenge the All Progressives Congress, APC, has caused Nigeria. Atiku said the APC has caused Nigeria only disunity and woes. The former Vice President lamented that Nigeria was more divided under the APC government than pre-civil war era. He spoke in Lagos at a meeting of PDP members ahead of the upcoming primary election. According to Atiku: ”We are living witnesses of the challenges that the All Progressives Congress (APC) has caused us in this country. “The biggest challenge that APC has brought is disunity. We have not been as divided like this before even during the war. “We have a responsibility to send the party away but we must be united to enable us to do that. Lagos PDP has been in disunity for many years. I appeal to Lagos PDP to bring about unity in the party. I appeal to the eldest to please ensure unity in the Lagos State chapter of the party so that we can take over the State. “I look forward to working with you to reposition Lagos State PDP. We don’t want Lagos to be under one family. We want Lagos to belong to Lagosians. We should avoid making the same mistake that we have made over the years. I will continue to work with you until we achieve success.”
