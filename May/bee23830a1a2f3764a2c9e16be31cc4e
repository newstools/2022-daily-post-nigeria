The Leader Of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele has warned about the possibility of a coup ahead of the 2023 elections. Primate Ayodele said he foresees a political coup among politicians ahead of 2023, while warning of possible kidnapping and assassination of presidential aspirants. In a statement by his spokesman, Oluwatosin Osho, the cleric urged Nigerians to pray against political assassination because most politicians would be used as scapegoats. Primate Ayodele, however, assured that a military coup cannot happen in Nigeria. “Military Coup cannot come to Nigeria, but let us pray against instability, attacks, political coup that will come up among politicians, because the majority of those coming out don’t have political IQ, and northerners determining who becomes the president in Nigeria is a suicide mission. “If this continues, there is no way the unity of the country will not face troubles. Let us pray against political assassination. Most of those that want to become president will be used as scapegoats, let us pray against the kidnapping and assassination of presidential aspirants,” he said. The man of God mentioned the names of some politicians who have bought presidential nomination forms, noting that they wasted several millions of naira because they won’t get their mission actualized. “The likes of Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, Dave Umahi, Pius Anyim, Bala Mohammed, Dele Momodu, Emmanuel Udom, Fayose, Cosmos Ndukwe, Charles Okodili have all wasted money to buy presidential forms; they should have used the money to take care of people around them instead of spending it on a futile mission,” he stated.
