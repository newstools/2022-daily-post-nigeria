The Lagos State Government on Thursday warned that the seizure of commercial motorcycles by the Lagos State Task Force will continue in spite of the June 1 deadline. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State had on Wednesday given a fresh total ban on Okada riders’ operations in six Local Government Areas, which are Ikeja, Lagos Island, Eti-Osa, Apapa, Surulere and Lagos Mainland. The governor said that with effect from June 1, security operatives in the state should enforce the proscription order across the listed councils. However, in a statement by the Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbenga Omotoso, on Thursday, said that the deadline doesn’t invalidate the provisions of the Lagos State Transport Sector Reform Law of 2018. Omotoso disclosed that the Law stated that” no person shall ride, drive or propel a motorcycle or tricycle on a major highway within the state, and any person in contravention of this provision commits an offence” and would be made to face the wrath of the law. According to him, the Lagos State Task Force, led by CSP Shola Jejeloye, had continued to enforce the law, and had seized 238 motorcycles (Okada) in Lekki on Tuesday and Wednesday. He said in Iba, on Lagos-Badagry Expressway, where it was violently resisted on Thursday, the Task Force seized 195 motorcycles. He said,”The riders were operating on highways and bridges in flagrant disobedience of the law because, according to them, they’re free to ply unauthorised routes till June 1. This is wrong. “The February 1, 2020, the directive has not been reversed. The enforcement was weakened by COVID-19, which affected all areas of life. Now, the action is being reinforced.” He commended residents who had come out to support the ban on commercial motorcycles in the six local government areas.
