Gunmen suspected to be members of the Aiye cult group have killed another area boy, popularly known as Wale Matasaka in Abeokuta. The young man was butchered on Sunday night in front of a popular lounge at Quarry road in the state capital. This is coming barely a month after Tommy, a popular area boy around Oluwo was killed by suspected Aiye cult group members. It was gathered that Matasaka was a suspected member of the Aiye cult, fuelling speculations that his killing might be revenge for Tommy’s death by his members. Recall that no fewer than 15 young men were killed a few days after the murder of Tommy, despite the police setting up a special squad which arrested scores of the suspected cultists. A source, who spoke to DAILY POST in confidence said the victim was sighted by his killers at the gate of the popular lounge and was shot repeatedly. “After the victim fell down, the killers went further to butcher him before fleeing the scene,” the source said. The Ogun State police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said he could not speak at the time he was called and did not respond to text messages sent to him.
