Jose Mourinho has been hailed and ranked ahead of Manchester City’s Pep Guardiola after the Portuguese won the first edition of the Europa Conference League on Wednesday. The trophy is also AS Roma’s first ever in fourteen years. By winning the UECL trophy, Mourinho became the first football manager to win four European trophies with four different clubs. Roma defeated Dutch club Feyenoord 1-0 in Wednesday night’s UECL final. Speaking on talkSPORT, Saunders said: “Can you remember asking me that question, if you owned a football club, who would you have as manager? “I said Mourinho, and you said, ‘not Guardiola?’ “Well, Jose Mourinho has proven he can put an average group of players together and win the European Cup with Porto, and he just did it again last night with an average group of players at Roma. “He’s won something again and everything he said at Manchester United has come true. “He’s going to go down as one of the best managers in the history of football.”
