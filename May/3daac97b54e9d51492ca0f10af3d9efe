Few hours to the conduct of All Progressives Congress (APC) gubernatorial primaries in Bauchi State, a major contender, Al-Ameen Sani has withdrawn from the race. The APC stalwart told journalists in Bauchi on Thursday that regardless of the money spent so far on his campaign, his withdrawal was geared towards promoting unity in the party. “On behalf of myself and teaming supporters, I wish to formally announce my decision to withdraw from participating in the Bauchi State gubernatorial primary election of our great party, the All Progressive Congress (APC). “My decision to withdraw from this all important election is in the interest of the party and to foster unity and purpose among the aspirants whom I have had the privilege to chair in the 2022 Governorship Aspirants Forum. “It is important to state that my withdrawal from the contest is to encourage more aspirants to follow suit in order to have a hitch-free primary election. As a bona-fide member of our great party I feel I should make the sacrifice of withdrawing from the contest of the 2022 governorship primaries so as to make APC in Bauchi State a united family,” he said.
