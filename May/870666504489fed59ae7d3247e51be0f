Egypt football legend, Ahmed ‘Mido’ Hossam, has claimed Jose Mourinho will leave Roma and return to Real Madrid. Mido, in a tweet, also claimed Mourinho will sign Mohamed Salah from Liverpool. He added that he would be happy to see Salah play under the Portuguese tactician at the Bernabeu. “I have a feeling that Mourinho will go back to Madrid and will sign Salah. “I would love to see Salah playing for Madrid under Jose,” Mido tweeted. Mido’s comment is surprising considering a younger Salah struggled to break into the Chelsea team under Mourinho. There are also question marks whether the Egyptian would suit the tactical style of the Portuguese manager.
