The Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, Federal University of Technology Akure, FUTA branch, has protested Prof. (Mrs) Adenike Temidayo Oladiji’s appointment as the university’s eighth substantive Vice Chancellor. At a special meeting last week, the University Council, headed over by the pro-chancellor and chairman of council, Ambassador Godknows Boladei Igali, ratified Prof. Oladiji’s appointment as first female Vice-Chancellor of the institution. FUTA ASUU’s leader, Prof. Olayinka Awopetu, over the weekend criticized the appointment process, stating the union would not accept what it called a flawed procedure. Prof. Awopetu said after the weekend congress that such a defective process for appointing the new VC should not be tolerated in any civilized society. While emphasizing that the union was fighting for the university system as a whole, Awopetu stated that the move became imperative because the system is only known for merit. “At the congress, we looked at the process, we are not talking about individuals. “We found problems with the process at the very end of the procedure for the appointment of VC when the council had to pick from the list of the three candidates submitted to it. “Three nominees will be presented to the council in order of their positions. “Under normal circumstances, the council should pick the first because that is merit.There is no lobby about it.”
