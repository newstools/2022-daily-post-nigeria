Nollywood actress, Nse Ikpe-Etim, has revealed she felt inadequate as a woman when she found out she could not bear children of her own. Nse said this in an interview with Chude Jideonwo. The 47-year-old actress had earlier disclosed she had to undergo hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) to have a life again after she was diagnosed with adenomyosis. When asked if she was ashamed about not being able to have kids of her own, Nse said: “Finding out I couldn’t have children didn’t make me feel ashamed. I felt inadequate. “I felt inadequate as a woman but not ashamed, which was because of how I was brought up. “Where I’m from we don’t tie shame to ourselves. Where I was brought up, we live through life fully.” When asked if she is open to adoption, Nse said: “You never say never, but right now, my husband and I are just dog parents. “People should be allowed to live, my husband and I are okay right now.”
