The Confederation of African Football (CAF), has approved the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja, for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers. In a letter sent to the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), CAF stated that the ground will be used for the 2023 AFCON qualifier between the Super Eagles and and Leone Stars of Sierra Leone next month. This approval puts to an end speculations that the edifice will be barred from hosting international matches in the wake of the crowd disturbances that trailed the second leg of the 2022 World Cup qualifier against Ghana. FIFA has however ruled that the Nigeria vs Sierra Leone game will be played behind closed doors and also announced a fine of $150,000 on Nigeria for the disturbances after that World Cup qualifier. The Super Eagles are in Group A of the qualifiers with Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau and Sao Tome and Principe.
