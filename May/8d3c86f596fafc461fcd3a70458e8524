Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has said he could have scuttled the just concluded Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential primaries if he had wanted to. Wike said he opted against scuttling the convention because he didn’t want to destroy the PDP. The former PDP presidential aspirant disclosed this while addressing members of the party in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, yesterday. Wike finished second after polling 237 votes during the just concluded PDP convention. He was defeated by the winner, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, who had 371 votes. However, Wike said: “If I wanted to scuttle the convention, I would have done that, and I told them. There are people you think are human beings, but they are not human beings. “I have never seen how people can violate procedures and guidelines. Somebody had spoken; it is only at that point he was speaking that he can say I have withdrawn. You don’t call him back. “I just decided that this our party must not be destroyed. I would have left where I was sitting down and say this convention cannot go ahead except if you allow me to talk. I would have flattened him.”
