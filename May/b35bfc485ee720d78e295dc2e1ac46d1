Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain, Ebenezer Babatope, has warned the platform against actions capable of affecting its chances in 2023. The former Minister of Transportation said the party must ensure its May 28 presidential primary “is fair and credible”. Babatope told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that such would lead to the emergence of the best candidate as the flagbearer. “If we want to defeat the All Progressives Congress (APC) and give Nigerians a better deal in 2023, we should do things the right way from the primary”, he said. The chieftain warned that if there’s lack of equity, fairness and credibility, “I am afraid, we risk losing in 2023”. Babatope believes all the aspirants seeking the party’s ticket are experienced politicians with impressive credentials and good leadership records. On zoning, he suggested that competence and capacity, not region, should determine the next president. The former minister said the PDP should not insist on having a standard bearer from the North or South.
