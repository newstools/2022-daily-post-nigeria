Former Chelsea star, Chris Sutton, has pinpointed what Manchester City must avoid when they face Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final second leg tie in Spain on Wednesday night. Real Madrid will host Pep Guardiola’s men in the semi-final second leg tie at the Santiago Bernabeu. The Los Blancos lost 4-3 against Man City in the first leg last week at the Etihad Stadium. But Sutton wants the Premier League champions to avoid being generous to the LaLiga champions by not conceding goals like the first leg. “You can buy Defending For Dummies in paperback online, but we have to hope Pep Guardiola and Carlo Ancelotti didn’t add a copy to their baskets this week. The first-leg clash between Manchester City and Real Madrid was thrilling, in part because of the defensive naivety on show,” Sutton told Daily Mail. “The neutrals among us want to see more of the same tonight – two awesome attacking sides going head-to-head. That isn’t what Guardiola needs, mind. He wants City to be safer, less chaotic and more comfortable. He doesn’t want a classic, he wants a routine win. For that to happen, City cannot be as generous as they were last week.”
