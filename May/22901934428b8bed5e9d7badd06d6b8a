Bola Tinubu, a Presidential aspirant, on Wednesday, said the All Progressives Congress, APC, would remain intact after its presidential primaries. He disclosed this while addressing State House Correspondents shortly after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari. The APC National Leader had met with Buhari behind closed-doors at the State House last night. Speaking after the meeting, Tinubu said Buhari was committed to a transparent democratic process. According to Tinubu: “We are sure that we will remain united. You know our symbol is the broom, you don’t break it as you go. “Nigeria requires commitment, a uniform system and a stable country and that is the only way we can be very proud of Nigeria. “The president has shown a great example of leadership. He has given us the freedom to say you want to run, you want to attempt, go ahead. “He is a democrat and if we are running a constitutional democracy, you don’t hinder the desire, the wish of other people.”
