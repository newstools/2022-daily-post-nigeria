Human rights lawyer, Femi Falana, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to sack the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Governor, Godwin Emefiele. Falana said Emefiele’s continued as CBN governor could compromise the credibility of the 2023 general elections. Emefiele had indicated interest to contest as president in 2023 on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress, but rescinded the decision on Wednesday. However, Falana said the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, should remove sensitive voting materials from the CBN for the sake of free, fair and credible 2023 general elections, NAN reports. He spoke while addressing a Southwest youths and women conference at Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State on Thursday. “INEC is trying; it has deployed technology to get rid of rigging, but we can no longer keep sensitive election materials in the vault of the CBN. “This is because the governor of the CBN is a card-carrying member of the All Progressives Congress. “It has never happened anywhere in the world; this is very dangerous. The CBN governor’s power is enormous under the CBN Act, so he can’t be a politician. “We can’t look for alternative place to keep our electoral materials; it is the CBN governor that must be removed and whether President Buhari likes it or not, Emefiele must go. “Some Civil Society Organisations have filed a motion against him and we will pursue it to a logical conclusion,’’ Falana stressed.
