President Muhammadu Buhari reacted to the latest mass killing by bandits in Zamfara State. Scores were murdered in Damri, Sabongarin Damri, Kalahe villages in Bakura Local Government Area, and in Maradun. The President on Sunday ordered that outlaws must not be allowed to operate freely. A statement by spokesman Garba Shehu however hailed the military for their efforts. Buhari charged them to continue to achieve positive outcomes based on their current operational trajectory in the Northwest. “We mustn’t allow the return of days when the bandits had a free hand to do as they wished. “The rural folk in Zamfara and elsewhere must be allowed to have peace. “The momentum that has been developed must be sustained in order to bring closure to the activities of these murderers,” he said. The Nigerian leader expressed condolences to the families of the victims, the government and people of the state.
