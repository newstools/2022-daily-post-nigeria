Nigerian trio; Joe Aribo, Leon Balogun and Calvin Bassey were in action as Rangers won the Scottish Cup for the first time since 2009 courtesy of a 2-0 win against Hearts at the Hampden Park on Saturday. The Gers put their disappointing defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt in the final of the UEFA Europa League on Wednesday behind them to end the season on a positive note. The trio were in the starting line-up, with only Balogun and Bassey playing the full 120 minutes. Aribo, who was denied from a wonder save from Hearts goalkeeper Craig Gordon in the second half was replaced by Zambia forward Fashion Sakala on 105 minutes. Substitute Ryan Jack netted the opening goal for Giovanni van Bronckhorst’s men in the fourth minute of extra-time. Another substitute, Scott Wright scored the second goal in 97 minutes. The forward received a pass from Ryan Kent, burst into the box and fired a shot past Gordon.
