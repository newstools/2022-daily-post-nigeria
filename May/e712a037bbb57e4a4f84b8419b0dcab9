Member representing Kabba-Bunu/Ijumu Federal Constituency of Kogi State, Teejay Yusuf has urged constituents to stop mocking Senator Dino Melaye for failing to clinch Kogi West Senatorial district’s 2023 ticket at the PDP primaries. The lawmaker in the lower legislative chamber contested and defeated Dino in a rerun election on Tuesday and scored 167 against Dino’s 99 votes, a development that sparked mockery from constituents. While appreciating his constituents, he described his success as a demonstration of purpose by the people who are yearning for good governance. In a statement which he issued and made available to DAILY POST on Wednesday, he said the resort to mocking Dino who he described as a vicious opponent was unhelpful to the Peoples Democratic Party. “My brother, Senator Dino Melaye did not waste time in conceding victory to me; no matter what anyone thinks, he is a good man and a good politician who will remain relevant well beyond 2023. Yusuf said Dino is a Chieftain of the party and he remains relevant in the party, particularly in pursuit of the common cause. He commended Senator Melaye for conceding defeat after the Returning Officer announced the results in his favour, adding that his success was a result of eminent personalities at home and abroad who continue to call delegates to vote for him. “In fact, while I thank all our elders at home and abroad as well as all our party leaders and eminent non-PDP citizens who consistently called delegates to ensure votes for me, I must thank Senator Dino Melaye for his immediate concession speech and brotherly disposition which did not just begin today,” Teejay Yusuf stated.
