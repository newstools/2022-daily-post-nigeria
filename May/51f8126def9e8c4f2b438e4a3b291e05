Manchester United winger, Anthony Elanga has disclosed that fellow teammate, Cristiano Ronaldo helped him to become a key player in the Red Devils’ squad at Old Trafford. Elanga said that Ronaldo has been advising him since the Portugal captain re-joined Man United from Juventus last summer. The 20-year-old has enjoyed a breakout campaign for Man United so far this season. The Swedish youngster has featured regularly under interim boss, Ralf Rangnick. Speaking to Sky Sports, Elanga said he often picks Ronaldo’s brains in training and is delighted to have lined up alongside the five-time Ballon d’Or winner. Elanga said, “I grew up watching United as well, so the likes of Wayne Rooney and obviously Cristiano Ronaldo. I speak to Cristiano a lot in training and he is always giving me advice. “I grew up watching him at Old Trafford, so now to be able to play together is just an amazing feeling.” He added, “There are many other players who have helped me as well. The likes of Victor Lindelof, who I play with internationally. Juan Mata and Bruno Fernandes too. I have also learnt a lot from Zlatan Ibrahimovic from the national team. So I have got a lot of experience around me which can help me reach the next level.”
