Nigerian Army and Nigerian Customs Service officers have assaulted a human rights activist, Samson Nwachukwu. Nwachukwu is a Special Assistant to Delta Governor Ifeanyi Okowa and an Ombudsman with the Attorney General’s office. The incident occurred along Benin/Agbor Expressway on Saturday. Rights advocate, Harrison Gwamnishu posted the video on Sunday on his Facebook page. He said Nwachukwu, who is also a volunteer for Behind Bars, “never retaliated but endured the pain”. “We will protest this assault till the Authority discipline these men. “We are shutting down that expressway to demand Justice. We want to know his crime. #EndBrutality.” Citizens are regularly assaulted by security agents with most getting away with the act. In October 2020, youths participated in the EndSARS nationwide protest that shook Nigeria and attracted. international attention. The demonstration led to a scrap of the notorious police unit and the formation of panels of inquiry in many states.
