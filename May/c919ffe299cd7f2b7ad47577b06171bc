Jose Mourinho’s AS Roma are reportedly under investigation by federal prosecutors for anti-sporting chants and the behaviour of their players after their bus parade celebrating the 2021/22 UEFA Europa Conference League (UECL) glory. Roma defeated Feyenoord 1-0 to win the UECL on Wednesday night in Albania. Nicolo Zaniolo scored the winner for the Serie A side in the first half of the encounter. However, wild celebrations followed on Thursday as Roma paraded the trophy around the city in front of thousands of supporters. During the bus parade, some players taunted fierce rivals, Lazio, by joining in chants ridiculing their city neighbours while also holding up banners. Although no details have been published, Roma is under investigation for ‘anti-sporting’ behaviour, according to Football Italia. Roma star Zaniolo joined chants demanding Lazio fans to ‘change the channel’, while Marash Kumbulla held up a sign mocking the club’s rival. Giallorossi fans also started a chant of ‘Whoever doesn’t jump supports Lazio’ and manager Jose Mourinho was seen singing along. Roma’s bus was given a police escort and the players looked to be in a jubilant mood, with a number of them seen dancing to music blasting out in the streets.
