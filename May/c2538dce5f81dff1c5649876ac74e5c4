Manchester United forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, has indicated he would be willing to take the skipper’s armband after Erik ten Hag compiled a three-man shortlist to replace Harry Maguire. Ronaldo, David de Gea and Bruno Fernandes are among the candidates, according to ESPN. This is because Maguire will not be a guaranteed starter under Ten Hag, Maguire’s lack of pace is also a concern with Ten Hag’s tendency to play with a high defensive line. Ronaldo has emerged as the clear favourite to be named Maguire’s successor as captain and it seems like he would take Ten Hag up on his offer given his authoritative role in the dressing room as he embraces being a role model to his teammates. The 37-year-old mentored the younger players within the squad last season as he set an example for the likes of Jadon Sancho, Scott McTominay, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Elanga.
