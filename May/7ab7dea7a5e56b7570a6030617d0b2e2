Former Aviation Minister, Osita Chidoka, has expressed sadness over the murder of ‘Army couple‘ in Imo State and urged all Igbo to speak up. In a statement on Monday, Chidoka, who said he watched the video, called the act a sacrilege and desecration of Igboland. He noted that killing a woman whose crime is that she has a job to keep body and soul together “is tragic and unpardonable”. “Our culture and spiritual belief system do not permit the killing of Women, Nwa okpu. It is evil. Evil has entered our land”, said the ex-Corps Marshall. Chidoka recalled that the Igbos suffered for the kidnap and selling of their people during the slave trade era. The forebears, according to him, will turn in their graves, as the foundation of Igboland community has been violently shaken by misplaced anger. Chidoka said the South-East has entered a high conflict stage, where all forms of evil are perpetrated and condoned under the guise of a fight for justice. He added that the blood of the murdered woman beheaded by a man born of a woman will seek justice against everyone. “All Town Unions, Traditional Rulers, Church leaders, women societies, and right-thinking Igbo people should speak up now.” The statement insists it is wrong to kill people for who they are or where they work. Chidoka said women and disadvantaged groups must be respected, adding that killing unarmed people is a crime against humanity.
