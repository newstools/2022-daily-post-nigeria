The Board of Trustees (BoT) Chairman, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Walid Jibrin, has claimed the All Progressives Congress sabotaged its candidate, Atiku Abubakar in 2019. In a statement on Monday, Jibrin declared that it was the sabotage that paved the way for Muhammadu Buhari of the Progressives Congress (APC) to emerge ‘winner’. Jibrin said the former Vice President’s victory at the PDP convention has presented Nigerians an opportunity to install a government for all. “We must remember that Atiku was in 2019 elected at the PDP presidential primary in Port-Harcourt, but was nakedly sabotaged by APC.” Jibrin told Nigerians to remember “the good performance” of Atiku as ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo’s deputy. The PDP leader insists the flagbearer is the best man to lead the country because “he’s not a tribalist”. Jibrin further hailed the delegates, party members and urged them to work for a successful outing next year.
