The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has threatened to embark on an indefinite strike as the two months warning strike ends today, Monday. This was disclosed on Sunday by the union, in an ongoing National Executive Council meeting in Abuja. At the meeting, ASUU accused the Federal Government of being unserious, stating that it would intimate Nigerians on the outcome of its meeting. Recall that the union had in February this year, announced a four-week warning strike, which was extended by eight weeks in March following the inability of the union and the Federal Government to reach a common ground on the demands of the university lecturers. Some of the demands of ASUU include the release of revitalization funds for universities, renegotiation and implementation of the 2009 FGN/ASUU agreement, release of earned allowances for university lecturers, and deployment of the UTAS payment platform for the payment of remuneration of university lecturers. Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, who is also a 2023 presidential aspirant under the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, had in a statement on Friday, said the Federal Government would be meeting with ASUU on Monday to resolve the lingering issues. But the National President of ASUU, Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke, told DAILY POST yesterday that they have not received any invitation from the government.
