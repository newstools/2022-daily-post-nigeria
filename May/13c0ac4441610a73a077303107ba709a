Former Chelsea striker, Demba Ba, believes Napoli’s Kalidou Koulibaly should be a priority target under the club’s new owner, Todd Boehly, this summer. Chelsea over the weekend confirmed that Boehly had struck a £4.25billion deal to buy the Blues from Roman Abramovich. Ba wants Boehly and his consortium to sign Koulibaly because the Senegal defender can handle pressure and is also a top footballer. Koulibaly has been linked with a move to Chelsea, Barcelona and Manchester United. Asked if Chelsea should step up their Koulibaly hunt, Ba told The Byline: “One hundred per cent. One thousand per cent. “He has that stature. He can support pressure, bear in mind he plays for Senegal and plays for Napoli. “He can handle the pressure. He’s good as a football player and a top lad.”
