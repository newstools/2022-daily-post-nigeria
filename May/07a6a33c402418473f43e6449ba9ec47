Police authorities have confirmed that they lost one policeman during a gun battle with suspected militants in Bakassi on Friday morning. The Public Relations Officer of the Cross River State Police Command, Irene Ugbo said the gun duel was fierce and that they succeeded in neutralising the group. “It is not true that we lost two men when the Bakassi militants attacked us. We lost a policeman. “We are still on their trail and we are sure to get at them soon”, she said. The attack happened at the Ikang jetty in Bakassi LGA of Cross River State. Sources said a good number of other persons were injured during the attack and were evacuated to hospital. As at time of this report, the name of the militant group was not known as none had claimed responsibility. The policemen were said to be on duty at the jetty. About a month ago, a Pro-Biafra militant group bombed two gunboats in retaliation to the killing of their commander and disappearance of another by Cameroonian forces.
