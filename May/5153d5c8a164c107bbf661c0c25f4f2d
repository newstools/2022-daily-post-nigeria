An elder statesman, Tanko Yakassai, has alleged that some cabals in the Presidency are behind the increasing number of Presidential aspirants from the Southern part of Nigeria in the All Progressives Congress, APC. Yakassai claimed that cabals in the Presidency are encouraging some aspirants from the South to purchase the APC Presidential nomination forms. He said the aim was to break the clamour for APC to zone its presidential ticket to the Southern part of the country. In a statement, the elder statesman said: “We know it that all these presidential aspirants of the APC from the South are being encouraged by some cabals in the Presidency for the purpose of breaking the clamour for a southern presidential candidate from the APC. “The cabals are doing it to break the ranks of the southern part of the country that are clamouring for a power shift.” APC has recorded a large number of its members who have signified interest to run for the Presidency from the Southern part of the country. From the South-East, the likes of Peter Obi, former Anambra State governor; Chris Ngige, Minister for Labour and Employment; Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, Minister of State for Education; Orji Uzor Kalu, Senate Chief Whip; and Rochas Okorocha, Imo West Senator are running for APC’s ticket. In the Southwest, Bola Tinubu, APC National Leader; Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State; Pastor Tunde Bakare; among others are vying for the party’s presidential ticket.
