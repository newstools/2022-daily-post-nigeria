European Union foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, on Monday asked that the union considers seizing frozen Russian foreign exchange reserves to help pay for the cost of rebuilding Ukraine after the war. Borrell said this in an interview with Financial Times, stating that it would be logical for the EU to do what the United States did with Afghan central bank assets after the Taliban took over the Asian nation. “We have the money in our pockets, and someone has to explain to me why it’s good for the Afghan money and not good for the Russian money,” Borrell said. Recall that Washington froze the Afghan funds after the military takeover by the Taliban.
