Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has revealed that he has not met the club’s prospective new Chelsea owner, Todd Boehly, or discovered how much money he has to spend this summer in the transfer window. Tuchel said this on Tuesday during his pre-match press conference ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League tie with Leeds United on Wednesday. Recall that American billionaire, Todd Boehly, and his consortium are now on the verge of completing a £4.25 billion takeover after agreeing on a deal to buy Chelsea last weekend. Asked if he has met with Boehly, Tuchel said: “Absolutely not. Maybe if I had, I wouldn’t tell you! But I don’t have so I don’t need to lie.” He added, “Nothing has changed for us at Cobham, we are still waiting for the confirmation, for things to progress, to hopefully have news for you and for us, for the team, to inject some positive energy. “It feels like it will come to an end and give us possibilities to act, but at this very moment it’s not like this.” “We are the only club at the moment that suffers like this, maybe the first club that ever did this. “These are steps in the right direction. We are waiting for it for a long time. “We need positive energy and a competitive atmosphere at the club. It’s very important for things to progress.”
