Youths of Anambra State, comprising many groups have begged the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to rescind its decision to throw open the contest for the presidential ticket, describing it as an affront to the South, especially the Southeast zone. The youths, donning white T-shirts during a rally presented a position paper to the leaders of the party in the state on the matter. They had converged on Ekwueme Square in Awka, from where they danced through the streets of Awka to the secretariat of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at Udoka Housing Estate, Awka. At the PDP secretariat, Mr Ikechukwu Anonye, the Anambra State Coordinator for Peter Obi Support Network (POSN), and coordinating chairman of all Peter Obi Support groups told journalists that the position paper is addressed to the national chairman of PDP, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, expressing hope that it gets to him. He said: “Today’s solidarity walk is to let the PDP know that we are aware of the schemings going on in the party and that we know that the PDP has a constitution that supports rotation of the presidency between the North and the South. “Now that it is the turn of the South and precisely the Southeast, and we are hearing that a committee has met and thrown it open for everybody. We consider it a level of injustice against the Southeast region. “We want them to revert to the Southeast or the South in general and we know that they can rescind their decision. Every other zone has had a shot at the presidency except the Southeast. If they do not do the right thing, I think PDP should forget it.
