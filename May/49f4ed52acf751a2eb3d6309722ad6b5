Alex Akinsowon, a 32-year-old timber contractor, has been charged with attempted murder before an Ondo Chief Magistrates’ Court. Mrs Charity Adeyanju, the presiding Magistrate, charged the defendant with two counts of conspiracy and attempt to murder one Bode Akinsiku with a gun. The defendant and others at large, according to the prosecution, committed the crime on April 23, 2022, around 10:30 p.m. at Ebunoluwa street, Ayeyemi, in the Ondo town magisterial district. Sections 516 and 320 of the Criminal Code, Cap 37, Vol 1 and 2 Laws of Ondo State of Nigeria, 2006, were allegedly violated. The defendant entered a not guilty plea to the charge that was brought against him. Inspector Benard Olagbayi, the prosecutor, told the court that he would bring two witnesses to testify in the case while he sought a date to read the case file. Mr P.O Afolayan, the defendant’s counsel, did not object to the prosecutor’s request for bail, but instead requested that the prisoner be released on the most lenient terms possible. Adeyanju gave the defendant bail in the amount of N200,000 with one surety in the same amount. The case was adjourned to June 23, 2022, to await the DPP’s advice.
