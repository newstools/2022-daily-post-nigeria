The Transition Monitoring Group (TMG) said appointees still in office despite aspiring for political positions in 2023 were doing so illegally. The organization also kicked against the use of state resources for election campaigns and party activities. TMG Chairman, Auwal Rafsanjani, stressed that the use of taxpayers’ funds and common resources to cover personal purposes was unacceptable. In a statement at the weekend, the activist cited how ministers and other officials use state apparatus like government jets, cars and money for their ambitions. The action does not create a level playing ground and is a bad omen for democracy, the Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC) chief noted. Rafsanjani said it was “shocking and alarming” that, despite the enormous challenges in Nigeria, some have the audacity to run for offices with public funds. TMG also condemned the exorbitant costs of the nomination and expression of interest forms to contest in party primaries. The body said such could only be afforded by people with access to corrupt funds and those with plans to recoup their wealth when elected. Rafsanjani urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the police and anti-corruption agencies to track the huge exchange of money at party conventions. TMG wants the monitoring of aspirants who bribe delegates, stating that the sharing of dollars and other international currencies has depicted that the highest bidder usually wins elections. Rafsanjani told political appointees and other public servants aiming for elective positions to tender their resignation immediately. He maintained that government officials preparing to contest elections and holding on to their positions were violating Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act 2022 as amended. “In compliance with the provision, all political appointees and other public servants should submit their resignation letters and run their campaigns legally”, the statement added.
