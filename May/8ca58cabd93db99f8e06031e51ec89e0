Ahead of the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential primary election, President Muhammadu Buhari has asked governors elected on the platform of the ruling party to allow him pick his successor. The president made the request in his address during a meeting with the Progressives Governors Forum in Abuja on Tuesday. According to Buhari, the state governors were given the opportunity to pick their successor, asking them to allow him do same at the federal level. Buhari said, “In keeping with the established internal policies of the Party and as we approach the Convention in a few days, therefore, I wish to solicit the reciprocity and support of the Governors and other stakeholders in picking my successor, who would fly the flag of our party for election into the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023. “We gave governors re-election tickets or opportunity to pick their successors; allow me pick my successor.”
