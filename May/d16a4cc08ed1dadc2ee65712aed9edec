Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola has responded to Patrice’s Evra’s comments that his management style makes players feel like they are stripped of autonomy and commanded as if in a Playstation game. https://dailypost.ng/2022/05/10/epl-he-cant-coach-players-with-personality-doesnt-want-leaders-evra-slams-guardiola/ Guardiola suggested the jibe is an attempt to get a job at rivals, Manchester United. “I don’t want personality? Well. I don’t agree, Patrice! I don’t play. I need personalities and good players to play on the pitch. “I didn’t read it or know [what he’s said]. I have had nice, incredible players in my past as a manager at Barcelona, Bayern Munich and here. Most of them have won World Cups, European [Championships], Champions Leagues and leagues. “Patrice — if we were together, I would show you the personality and character of my players right now that we have, absolutely. Maybe Evra is right or maybe he’s doing a good quote to come back to Manchester United to work there. Maybe there’s a good chance now,” Guardiola said.
