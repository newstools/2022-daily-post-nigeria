Everton attacker, Richarlison has hit back at Liverpool legend, Jamie Carragher after the Toffees’ Premier League 3-2 victory over Crystal Palace on Thursday. Richarlison said Carragher should wash his mouth before saying things about him and Everton. Carragher has often accused Richarlison of going down easily in matches this season in search of a penalty or a foul. It all started in April with the Merseyside Derby when Everton frustrated Liverpool in the first half. Frank Lampard’s men tried to break the flow of the game by time-wasting, committing fouls, or even diving, which saw Anthony Gordon being booked for simulation. However, two second-half goals ensured the Reds won the game 2-0. Carragher has since spoken a few times about Richarlison’s supposed play-acting. But Richarlison has now hit back at the former Liverpool defender, insisting that he doesn’t respect him. The Brazilian wrote in a tweet via his Twitter handle after Everton defeated Crystal Palace: “@Carra23 wash your mouth before you talk about me and Everton and I don’t respect you”
