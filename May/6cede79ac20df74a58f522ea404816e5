Scottish Premiership club, Rangers will hold fresh talks with centre-back, Leon Balogun in the coming days over contract extension. Balogun’s contract at the Ibrox will expire next month and the Super Eagles star has expressed his desire to extend his stay at the club. According to the Daily Record, sporting director Ross Wilson will sit down with the Nigerian international defender this week to discuss his future. The 33-year-old has got the option of an extra 12 months on his current deal and it could be a case of formalities before triggering it. Balogun linked up with the Gers on a free transfer in July 2020 and won the Scottish Premiership title in his first season at the club. The former Wigan Athletic player was a regular under former manager Steven Gerrard, with his versatility making a key member of the squad. Injuries limited his appearance for the Gers in the 2021/22 campaign. He featured for 120 minutes in Rangers’ Scottish Cup final win against Hearts at the Hampden Park last weekend.
