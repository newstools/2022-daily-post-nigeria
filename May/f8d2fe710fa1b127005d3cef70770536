Seven motorcyclists from the Bashu community in Boki Local Government Area of Cross River State have been shot dead by Ambazonian militants. They were shot dead Monday morning, according to Chief Cletus Obun, a former member of the Cross River State House of Assembly, who gave updates on yesterday’s invasion of the Boki LGA community by the Cameroonian militants. He said the young men usually ride their motorcycles from Bashu to the borderline communities to ferry passengers from and to Nigeria. “The Ambazonian soldiers shot them when the boys rode their bikes to help convey the fleeing Cameroonians, especially elderly women, from the community where the Ambazonian militants killed at least 20 yesterday for refusing to join them to fight President Paul Biya’s government,” he said. Obun also added that as of Monday morning, there was still a stream of refugees fleeing the killings in the Cameroonian community into Bashu. “Their sheer number is impacting on few facilities and raising much environmental and humanitarian concerns already”, he said. Meanwhile, Deputy Leader of Biafra National League (BnL), Ebuta Takon while confirming the attack by Ambazonian militants and the killing of 20 people issued a five-day ultimatum to Ambazonia leaders to apologise over the incident. Meanwhile, reports say the BnL has blocked Ekong Anaku and other border communities in Akamkpa LGA to prevent Cameroonians from entering through the route and is threatening to coordinate an attack in Southern Cameroon over the invasion of Cross River. “We are giving them five days, just five days for their leaders to apologise to us and Cross Riverians,” Takon said.
