The home-based Super Eagles will know their opponents in the qualifiers for the the 2022 African Nations Championship (CHAN) on Thursday (today). The draw ceremony, which will hold at the Confederation of African Football (CAF) headquarters in Cairo, Egypt, will be live on all CAF digital platforms at 11:00 GMT. CAF Head of Competitions, Khaled Nassar will be assisted by Algerian legend, Djamel Menad, who will serve as the draw assistant. For the first time in the history of the competition, 18 teams will participate in the next final tournament set to take place in Algeria from January 8-31, 2023. The home-based Super Eagles failed to qualify for the last edition of the competition hosted by Cameroon. The West Africans came second at the 2018 edition, losing 4-0 to hosts Morocco in the final. Morocco successfully defended their crown in 2020 in Cameroon, beating Mali 2-0 in a thrilling final at the Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium, Yaounde. The CHAN is a biennial tournament organised by CAF exclusively featuring players from the respective national championships.
