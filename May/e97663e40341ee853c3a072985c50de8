Ace British journalist and a diehard fan of Arsenal Football Club, Piers Morgan has hit out at the club for giving manager, Mikel Arteta a new long-term contract. Morgan is not comfortable with the timing of the contract which came before the end of the season. The 40-year-old manager signed a contract extension that would keep him at the Emirates Stadium until 2025 as they hope to return to the Champions League. But Morgan questioned the timing of the contract extension at the Emirates. The Gunners are currently fourth in the Premier League after consecutive wins against Chelsea, Manchester United and West Ham. Mikel Arteta’s men are leading the race to qualify for next season’s Champions League ahead of Tottenham and Manchester United. But despite Arsenal’s positive form, Morgan has questioned the timing of Arteta’s new deal. Taking to social media, he tweeted, “What? Maybe wait until he achieves something? Why is he getting this now?” Morgan’s 7.9 million followers were quick to comment on his post, with many having mixed opinions on whether Arsenal made the correct decision.
