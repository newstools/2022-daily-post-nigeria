The All Progressives Congress (APC) has postponed its primary for Abia Central Senatorial District till May 29. Mr Izuchukwu Okeke, Chairman of Abia Central Senatorial Election Committee, made this known on Saturday. Okeke, who informed delegates from the six local government areas that make up the senatorial district, did not give any reason for the postponement. He said he was not happy with what is going on and decided to stop the primary. “Therefore, I and my team have decided to step down this primary, to be conducted tomorrow morning (Sunday),” the chairman told delegates. But NAN observed that the election may have been moved due to alleged discrepancies in the delegates’ lists. One of the contestants, Sen. Nkechi Nwogu, had earlier withdrawn from the race. Nwogu, who had occupied the seat for eight years, in a statement issued to newsmen, expressed disappointment with what he called the ‘protracted division’ in the state chapter of the party.
