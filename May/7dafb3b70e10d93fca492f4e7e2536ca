Ebonyi State Governor Dave Umah, says President Muhammadu’s body language favours the emergence of a Southerner as his successor in 2023. The All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential aspirant made the comment on Tuesday in Owerri, the Imo capital. Umahi told Nigerians not to be apprehensive of an individual from the South-East becoming president. He advised them to shun the calls for secession because Igbos have property and investments everywhere. “So when people tell you about Biafra, it is not about seceding at all”, NAN quoted him saying. Umahi assured that “the Igbo man will do better under a united Nigeria”. The governor also wants power rotation between the North and South maintained. He appealed to the South-South and the South-West to support the South-East to produce the best President. “The North-East and South-East are the two regions that are most marginalized”, Umahi said.
