Newcastle go into the final game of the Premier League season with an outside shot of the top 10. “It was a brilliant all-round performance. We played with intensity and never let up. We approached the game in a brilliant manner and we did the Premier League proud tonight,” Howe said at his post-match press conference. “The one thing missing from us was that we had not beaten a top-six team and we deservedly beat them. “We wanted to press Arsenal and not let them settle into a rhythm but also for the first time in recent performances we saw a team that could have the ball comfortably and be creative. Arsenal competed well and fought well but they left spaces for us and we exploited them.”
