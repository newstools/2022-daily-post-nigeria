Musa Mani, a top Commander of the Islamic State of the West Africa Province (ISWAP) has surrendered to the troops of the Multi-National Joint Task Force (MNJTF) following sustained joint operations on the fringes of the Lake Chad. Zagazola Makama, a Counter Insurgency Expert and Security Analyst in Lake Chad disclosed this on his Twitter handle on Saturday. Makama gathered that Mani, who was from Diffa in the Niger Republic, surrendered to troops of the task force in Damasak and Malam Fatori. Impeccable sources told Makama the surrendered Commander of Hisbah Militant (civil police) was in charge of supervising activities of the insurgents with a view to ensuring right conduct as well as controlling logistics supplies, tax and levies being paid by fishermen and farmers in the Lake Chad. The 43-year-old suspect, according to Makama’s tweet confessed that the ongoing offensive by troops of Operation Hadin Kai and Operation Lake Sani made him escape and surrender. “The suspects told troops that dozens of fighters had died while many have escaped due to the fear of being killed,” he said. He, however, noted that preliminary investigation revealed that the suspect is a high profile member of the terrorist group. “The suspect is currently undergoing profiling in troops’ custody,” he added.
