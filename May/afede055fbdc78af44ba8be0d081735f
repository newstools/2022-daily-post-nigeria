With the latest trends trailing the 2023 general elections, the Aare Onakakanfo of Yoruba Land, Iba Gani Adams has said Nigerians are fast losing faith in the crop of politicians, especially when President Muhammadu Buhari whom they believed was a messiah, disappointed them. He bared his mind during his 52nd birthday celebration in Lagos. According to Adams, Nigerians can hardly trust any of the candidates clamouring to be President by 2023. According to him, “I can tell you from all indication, the only man Nigerians believed that will salvage the country was Buhari but he disappointed them. All those clamouring for President now, Nigerians don’t trust them. “It is very clear that people are not excited or willing to cast their vote, the number of people still willing to vote is reducing every time. The candidate that has the experience will not be allowed to be the President of Nigeria, because they have commercialised the political space and that is the reason we don’t get it right as a country. “We always advise our politicians not to run away from the way we started, the Constitution we wrote in 1963. If we don’t do the needful, I don’t know what will happen in the next three years.” Reacting to the strike embarked upon by the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, Adams said the country is sitting on a keg of gun powder, “I can tell you categorically that the way this country is going I am not happy at all. We are running away from the basis, we are trying to abandon the job of nation-building. All that our political class are interested in is power and making money at the expense of common people and oppressing them. “When you talk about culture some religious groups will think you are promoting something bad, but to the glory of God, we have been able to change people’s perception about religion and culture.
