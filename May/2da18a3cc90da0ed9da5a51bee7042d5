Liverpool legend, Jamie Carragher has advised incoming Manchester United manager, Erik Ten Hag to offload Cristiano Ronaldo this summer. Carragher believes Ronaldo will be a problem for Ten Hag next season at Old Trafford. The former defender stated this while speaking with Gary Neville on YouTube channel, the Overlap. He said, “I’m convinced that Ten Hag has got to do it with Ronaldo, whether he’s allowed to or not. I have said this consistently throughout this season: that was not a good signing. Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the greatest players of all time, and I’m seen as a guy who’s criticising Ronaldo. “Ronaldo is a million times a better player than I ever was; I am not fit to lace his boots, obviously, but I’m not saying that to be disrespectful to him – he’s amazing – but Ronaldo has never played in a team this bad. He’s always played for great teams, and his attitude of trying to be the main man, driving the team on, getting the goals, when you are in a great team, that is seen as a positive. “When you are not playing for a great team, it can be seen as a negative, and I think it has been this season. Man United can’t go into next season with a centre-forward who will be 38, even if he does score goals. That is not right for Man United.” He added: “United need to buy a striker, but who do you buy? Do you buy one who’s going to play, or one who’s going to sit on the bench? What do you do? If you buy a really good one then he has to play, and Ronaldo has to go on the bench. “Ronaldo would be a massive problem for Manchester United next season if he wasn’t playing every week, we have seen it this season, even when he’s coming off and there were times where the manager was right to take him off or put him on the bench, but he’s kicked up a fuss.”
