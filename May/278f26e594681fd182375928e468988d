Sporting Lisbon’s Ruben Amorim has emerged as the favourite manager to replace Mauricio Pochettino at Paris Saint-Germain, according to PSG Talk via Le Parisien. Pochettino’s future is up in the air after failing to guide PSG to a UEFA Champions League triumph this season. PSG are already scouting the market for replacements, and Amorim is the latest name to be linked to the Parc des Princes job. Amorim has been a hit with Sporting Lisbon, guiding them to the league title last season. The Portuguese helped Sporting finish second in the league in the recently concluded season. The Parisians are impressed with the 37-year-old manager and want to put him in charge of the Parisians. Amorim is currently tied to Sporting till 2024 and has a release clause of €30 million.
