Former lawmaker, Senator Shehu Sani, has called on the Federal Government of Nigeria to take the threat made by bandits who abducted the Abuja-Kaduna train passengers seriously. Sani made the plea in a tweet via his Twitter handle on Tuesday. He tweeted: “The threat made by the terrorists who abducted the Abuja-Kaduna train passengers that they will start “killing them in 7 days’ time” should be taken seriously. “Similar threat was made and ignored two months ago with tragic consequences.” DAILY POST had earlier reported that terrorists who attacked and kidnapped the 28 March 2022 Abuja-Kaduna bound train passengers have threatened to, within seven days, start killing the passengers in captivity if their demands are not met. They called the government to, as a matter of urgency, release their children allegedly kept in a Yola detention facility in Adamawa State. Malam Tukur Mamu and Dan Iyan Fika, the spokesman of Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, were spoken to on the phone by the leaders of the terrorists. The terrorists claimed that the Federal Government suspended the resumption of the train service because of their threats in the audio of the conversations between Malam Tukur Mamu and the leaders of the terrorists that executed the Abuja-Kaduna train attack.
