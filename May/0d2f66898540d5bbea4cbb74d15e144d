The Police in Ogun State on Tuesday, arrested four suspected members of the Eiye cult group. They were nabbed while holding a nocturnal meeting “in preparation for an attack to be launched on members of another cult group.” The Ogun State police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, identified the suspects as Oriyomi Bankole (a.k.a Ortom), Odedina Sodiq, Shofola Ayodeji and Adelawa Ayo. Oyeyemi said they were nabbed at different locations in Oke-Lantoro and the technical college at Leme. Their arrest, according to Oyeyemi, followed credible information received by the police about their meeting and the plan to launch an attack after their meeting. The State Commissioner of Police, CP Lanre Bankole, had ordered the CSP Shobiyi Oluwatoshin-led anti-cultists section to dislodge the hoodlums. “In compliance with the CP’S order, the team moved to the scene at about 8:30 pm where the four amongst the hoodlums were arrested while others escaped,” Oyeyemi said. He added that cutlasses, a battle axe and criminal charms were recovered from the suspects. Meanwhile, the CP has assured Ogun residents that “the command will not relent in its efforts to rid the state of criminal elements.”
