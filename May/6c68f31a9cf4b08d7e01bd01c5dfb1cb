Two suspects who allegedly killed a four-year-old boy have been arrested by the Niger State Police Command. NAN gathered that the victim was kidnapped and allegedly used for ritual in Lapai Local Government Area of Niger State. DSP Abiodun Wasiu, Niger command’s Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), who confirmed the incident on Saturday said investigations into the incident had commenced. Abiodun explained that the suspects were rescued from being lynched by an angry mob after the remains of the boy, who had been missing for four days, were discovered. Narrating the incident, an eyewitness identified one of the suspects as Emmanuel, a building materials trader. He said Emmanuel allegedly connived with his gateman to kidnap the child and kill him. He said the two suspects allegedly killed the child and removed his private parts, eyes, ears and heart, while his remains were put in the sack for the gateman, whose identity was unknown, to dispose of. “The gateman entered a motorcycle to a stream where he was to dispose of the remains, but on dropping the gateman, the motorcyclist noticed blood dripping from the sack. “The commercial motorcyclist alerted the bystanders and police,” the eyewitness said. The suspect who confessed that he was sent by his landlord to dump the body was arrested by the Police. The eyewitness added that the suspect had confessed that they were responsible for kidnapping the boy who had been declared missing for some days. Abiodun warned the public against mob action and assured them that justice would be served.
