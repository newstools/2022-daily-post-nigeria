The Emir of Katsina, Abdulmuminin Usman, has thrown his weight behind the 2023 Presidential ambition of Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo. Usman said Osinbajo has the experience to effectively occupy the President’s office. The monarch said Osinbajo, being a pastor, would effectively commune with God on how to pilot the affairs of Nigeria if elected President. He spoke in his palace in Katsina on Saturday when Osinbajo paid him a courtesy visit. The traditional ruler also advised the Vice President on how to go about his campaign. He said: “Take it from me, we are behind you; we will try as much as possible; someone with experience is a better person than someone who is very new to the administration. “You need some touches; the touches you need are consultations; we are the grassroots; you consult the traditional institution. “I really pray with all my heart that you succeed; that you carry on where your predecessor stopped and Allah will help you. “I know you are a quiet man; a pastor, you know God; you know how to go with Him; we will pray for you Insha Allah but in your mind take it.” Osinbajo was in Katsina as part of his consultation ahead of the All Progressives Congress, APC, convention.
