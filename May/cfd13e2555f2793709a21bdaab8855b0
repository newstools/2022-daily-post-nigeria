Former Chelsea star, Joe Cole believes Bruno Fernandes is struggling at Manchester United so far this season due to ‘pressure’. Cole also hailed Fernandes’ teammate, Cristiano Ronaldo, as he continues to rescue Man United with his incredible display so far this season. Fernandes, who signed a contract extension with Man United earlier this month, has endured an underwhelming season at Old Trafford. The midfielder has scored just nine goals in 43 appearances, with his last goal coming more than two months ago. “Bruno is what I like to call a high-tariff player,” Cole told Coral. “He takes risks with the ball, he likes to be the player everything goes through and he’s a tremendous footballer with great technical ability. “But I think he’s struggled with the pressure on his shoulders. The team just isn’t working this season. And I feel like Bruno operates a lot better when things are flowing through him. “At the moment, obviously, you have got Ronaldo, and he becomes the pivotal point. Bruno is a rhythm player and needs things going through him and he will take chances. And when it doesn’t work, then I feel like he struggles. “It highlights the other side of his game, he’s not an amazing presser, he’s not physically good. He’s like a quarterback, he needs to be dictating the play,” he added.
