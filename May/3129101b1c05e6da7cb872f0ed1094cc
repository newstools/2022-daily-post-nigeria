Niger State Governor, Alh. Abubakar Sani Bello has beat the Deputy Chief Whip of the National Assembly, Senator Abdullahi Sabi Aliyu to win the All Progressives Congress, APC, ticket for Niger North senatorial district in the State. The primary election, which was held in Kontagora, started on Saturday morning, and lasted till evening, Bello polled 335 votes against his incumbent, Senator Sabi, who got only seven votes. Only one invalid vote was recorded during the primaries. There are feelers, however, that Senator Sabi did not accept the election process and may likely look elsewhere (party) in his effort to retain his position in the Senate.
