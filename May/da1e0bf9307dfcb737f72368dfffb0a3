The Federal University Dutse has discovered species of mosquitoes that are resistant to most insecticide treated nets in Jigawa state. This was contained in a statement by the university’s Public Relations Officer, Abdullahi Yahaya Bello and issued to DAILY POST in Dutse on Sunday. He said this was the outcome of research conducted by the university as part of efforts to contribute to the fight against malaria in the country. According to him, the team of researchers led by Professor M.M. Dogara discovered that the mosquitoes are resistant to insecticides except the nets treated with a particular insecticide called Primiphosmethyl. He explained that the research, which was sponsored by the Global Program for Malaria Control under the Surveillance for Mosquitoes Resistance against three classes of insecticides (Pyrethroids, organochlorine, and organophosphates) in the 36 states of the federation plus the Federal Capital Territory, Prof. Dogara said the research became necessary at the time when mosquitoes all over the world are developing resistance to Long Lasting Insecticides Treated Bed Nets(LLITN) coated with pyrethroid insecticides. He said samples of larvaes from six local governments in Jigawa, which include Dutse, Birnin-Kudu, Kafin-Hausa, Auyo, Ringim and Taura were collected. “The research finding shows that only Primiphosmethl insecticides kill mosquitoes 100 percent and their recommendation is that henceforth only bed nets coated with Primiphosmethl should be deployed to Jigawa,” Dogara stated.
