The report further alleged that Emmanuel told Liquorose that he was bi-sexual. Reacting, Emmanuel on his Instagram page, denied the allegation and threatened to sue those behind it. “Hello friends, family and fans, I have recently been receiving messages from some misguided people who are making attempts to tarnish my reputation, one I have painstakingly built. “These persons peddling these rumors do not have any proof for the allegations they are making, but just to gain cheap publicity and defame me, do not fall for them. “They will be hearing from my lawyers and will surely pay for this embarrassment,” he wrote.
