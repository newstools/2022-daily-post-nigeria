Report reaching DAILY POST has it that members of the Miyetti Allah cattle rearers association have purchased the 2023 presidential form for former President Goodluck Jonathan. The group, DAILY POST gathered purchased the form for the ex-president on Monday. Recall that Jonathan, while addressing some youths who stormed his house a few weeks ago, urging him to join the presidential race, said he was not ready. At the moment, it is unclear if Jonathan would accept the form to join the race. More to come.
