The European Union (EU) has agreed on a partial ban on Russian oil imports amid the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. This was disclosed by European Council chief, Charles Michel. Michel made the announcement in a tweet via his Twitter handle on Monday evening. “Agreement to ban the export of Russian oil to the EU. This immediately covers more than 2/3 of oil imports from Russia, cutting a huge source of financing for its war machine,” Michel said. Michel’s announcement followed an extraordinary European Council summit attended by EU leaders in Brussels on Monday to discuss the sixth package of sanctions against Russia. “This sanctions package includes other hard-hitting measures: de-Swifting the largest Russian bank Sberbank, banning 3 more Russian state-owned broadcasters, and sanctioning individuals responsible for war crimes in Ukraine,” Michel added. EU leaders will meet again in Brussels on Tuesday to discuss the bloc’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
