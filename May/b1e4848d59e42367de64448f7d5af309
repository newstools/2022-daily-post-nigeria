Popular socio-political activist, Aisha Yesufu, has mocked Reno Omokri, former media aide to Nigerian ex-president, Goodluck Jonathan. DAILY POST had reported that Jonathan on Monday got APC’s N100million presidential nomination form. The form was purchased for him by the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders’ Association. Although Jonathan has not confirmed if he will join the 2023 presidential race, Reno Omokri, who is a fierce critic of the APC had denied Jonathan’s plans to dump the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Reacting shortly after the group purchased Jonathan’s presidential nomination form, Aisha Yesufu tweeted, “Where is Reno Omokri @renoomokri? Please assume it is Dr Oby Ezekwesili @obyezeks that has been reported by @BBCAfrica to have purchased APC Presidential form and start tweeting. Sew threads, buba and wrapper!”
