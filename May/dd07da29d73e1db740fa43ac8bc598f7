Presidential aspirant and former Governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, has advised Nigerians to always consider the future of the children in their political decisions. Obi gave the advice against the backdrop of the 2022 Children’s Day commemoration, marked every May 27. Obi, whose popular slogan is: “The society we abuse today will take its revenge on our children tomorrow”, said the slogan was born out of the pattern he observed over the years, where politicians do not think about tomorrow and about the children, insisting that no country can survive by recklessness and extravagance. He said the parameters of national development continue to point towards uncertainty for the future of Nigerian children, owing to the failure of governance in different tiers. According to him, unless the present dangerous trend of failure is reversed, the Nigerian child will remain disadvantaged. Obi urged Nigerians to leverage the coming elections and elect a leader who has the interest of the people at heart, noting that they must avoid being seduced into transactional politics and ensure that only credible persons, with track records of success, are elected into power. He advised children to remain on good behaviour, take their education seriously and remain law-abiding and useful to the society while wishing them a happy children’s day. Recall that Obi has been in the eye of the storm over his recent resignation from the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and withdrawal from the presidential race under the same party. While his next political move has been beclouded in mystery, Nigerians are waiting to see what would unfold in the coming days.
