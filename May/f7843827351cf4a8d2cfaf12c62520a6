Super Eagles trio: Joe Aribo, Leon Balogun and Calvin Bassey will look to help Glasgow Rangers win the UEFA Europa League when they take on Bundesliga club, Eintracht Frankfurt in the final at the Estadio Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan, Seville on Wednesday night (today). Rangers last won an European title 50 years ago and the trio have a chance to be part of history. The victory over Russian outfit Dynamo Moscow in 1972 was achieved in Spain, at the magnificent Nou Camp, Barcelona. So, perhaps Rangers have fate on their side. The Gers will also be coming up against a German opposition for the third time in the competition this season. Giovanni van Bronckhorst’s side defeated highly-fancied Borussia Dortmund in the Round of 32, and knocked out RB Leipzig in the semi-final. Aribo, Bassey, and Balogun have been key performers for Rangers in the competition. Aribo, who struggled a bit after returning from the Africa Cup of Nations in January, seems back to his best. The midfielder played in an unfamiliar centre-forward role in both legs of the semi-final clash against Leipzig following injury to talismanic striker, Alfredo Morelos. Calvin, who was voted Rangers’ Young Player of the Season has enjoyed a more successful campaign with the dethroned Scottish Premiership champions. The young defender, who is originally a left-back, thrived in the centre-back position following an injury crisis earlier in the campaign. For Balogun, this could be his penultimate appearance for Rangers, with his contract set to expire at the end of June. Rangers will also take on Hearts in the final of the Scottish Cup at the Hampden Park on Sunday.
