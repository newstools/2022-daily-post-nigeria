Arsenal legend, Paul Merson believes the club could sell William Saliba, who is currently on loan at Marseille, this summer. Merson also said that Arsenal are going to sign another centre-back this summer because Mikel Arteta’s side cannot rely on Ben White, Gabriel Magalhaes and Rob Holding. In his column for The Daily Star, Merson said, “William Saliba is running out of time to prove himself at Arsenal, and I think he could be sold this summer. There must be a reason he’s been loaned out three times by the club. “Was he getting ripped in training? I don’t see why he’s still on loan otherwise. Arsenal paid a lot of money for him, but I think if anyone offers them their money back, they would take it right now.” Merson added: “It’s almost three years he’s been there now, and he can’t get a look-in. Maybe Mikel Arteta has watched him train and decided he’s nowhere near ready. But if that’s the case, Arsenal are going to need another centre-back this summer because you can’t rely on Ben White, Gabriel Magalhaes and Rob Holding.”
