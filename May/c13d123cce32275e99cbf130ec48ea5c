Gareth Bale’s agent, Jonathan Barnett has confirmed the player will be leaving Real Madrid this summer. The 32-year-old will become a free agent at the end of the season. Despite winning every major honour during his time with the LaLiga giants, Bale has remained a divisive figure and has fallen completely out of favour. Bale spent last season on loan with Tottenham, before returning to Madrid, where he played only five times in the league and less than 300 minutes in all competitions. Barnett, who said a move back to England was most likely, has said a decision over his long-term future would depend on Wales’ 2022 World Cup play-off fate and that elimination could change his mind. “He leaves Real Madrid, but we have to wait for what Wales will be able to do,” Barnett told Portuguese outlet Record. “It all depends on whether Wales qualifies for the World Cup, then we will make a decision, which may vary whether or not Wales go to the World Cup. “Is it more likely to return to England? I think so, but we’ll have to wait and see if Wales qualifies for the World Cup.”
