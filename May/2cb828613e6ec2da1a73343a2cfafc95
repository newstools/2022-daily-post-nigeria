Former media aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri, has reacted to claims of Muslim youths looking for Christian youths in Sokoto State. Omokri said the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Mathew Hassan Kukah dismissed such a claim during a conversation they had. He disclosed that Bishop Kukah described claims of Muslim youths going house to house looking for Christian youths as false. In a tweet, the former Presidential aide stressed that some people were determined to disintegrate Nigeria. He wrote: “I spoke with Bishop Kukah and several other Christian clerics in Sokoto. “The information that Muslim youths are going house to house in Sokoto, looking for Christians to kill is false. “Some people have an agenda: the disintegration of Nigeria at any cost.” DAILY POST reports that there have been tension in many parts of the country, especially in the Northern region, following the murder of the Christian student, Deborah Samuel, who was burnt alive over alleged insult on Prophet Muhammed. Recall that pandemonium broke out in some parts of Sokoto State on Saturday following protest by Muslim men against the arrest of alleged killers of Deborah. Some churches, shops and other properties belonging to Christians were destroyed, as protesters demanded the immediate release of the suspects.
