Former England goalkeeper, Paul Robinson, has urged Manchester United to sign Ajax youngster Jurrien Timber this summer. Robinson believes Timber is a leader and will improve Maguire to become a world-class centre-back under new manager Erik ten Hag. He also claimed that Timber, 20, would be an ‘upgrade’ on Maguire’s teammate, Victor Lindelof. “Timber is a leader. He organizes at the back. He would definitely be an upgrade on Lindelof. I think he could be good alongside Varane or Maguire. Maguire isn’t a bad player. He’s just in a bad place and has been on a bad run of form,” Robinson was quoted by Sportskeeda as saying. “Under a new manager, I think we’ll see the Maguire that we know. It will be a fresh start. Having a player like Timber alongside him would only help. I think Maguire will get back to his best with a top-class centre-half next to him.”
