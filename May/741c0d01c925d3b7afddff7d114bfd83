About five persons have been reportedly killed in a fresh attack by suspected Fulani militias on Tse Alashi Kaambe Community, Guma Local Government Area of Benue State. The suspected Fulani militia invaded the community, Friday afternoon, at about 1pm in their large numbers when the victims were busy in their farms and brick moulding sites. A source confirmed to DAILY POST that “they killed three people who were working on their farms and also moved to where some people were moulding burnt bricks and killed two others after which they retreated. “They just want our people to vacate their ancestral homes for them, because as we speak, women and children are already fleeing the community.” Mr. Caleb Aba, Chairman of Guma Local Government Area, while confirming the incident, explained that it happened around 1pm Friday afternoon, alleging that armed Fulani herders invaded a community called Tse Alashi and killed three people who were working on their farm. He added that they also moved to a place where people were laying burnt bricks and killed two people without any provocation by the victims. Superintendent Catherine Anene, the State Police Public Relations Officer, confirmed the attack in the area.
