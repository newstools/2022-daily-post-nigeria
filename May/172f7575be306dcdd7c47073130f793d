Osun Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola has called on politicians across the political divide to play politics in accordance with the rules of the game. He also charged politicians to avoid anything that could threaten the peace of the State as it prepares for the Saturday, July 16, 2022, gubernatorial election. Making this call while addressing journalists after observing Eid-el-Fitr prayers on Monday in Osogbo, the Osun Governor noted that politics should not be seen as a do-or-die affair. According to him, “Since it is not a do-or-die affair, loyalists and supporters of candidates and political parties in the State should maintain decorum and guide their public conduct before, during and after the polls.” While maintaining that his administration would not leave any stone unturned in maintaining the peaceful atmosphere reigning in the State, Oyetola stressed that there was the need for citizens to be the vanguards of peace and also reflect same in their private and public conducts. “The State needs to guard and sustain its peace more than ever before, as the gubernatorial and general elections draw near. “Peace is sine qua non to development and nothing can substitute peace as it remains the only factor through which all that is good, most especially real development, can happen to the State and her people,” he stated. The Governor, who congratulated the Muslim Ummah for witnessing another Eid-el-Fitr celebration, urged them to take to the lessons of Ramadan to heart. “I enjoin you to continue to have the fear of God, obey His commandments and be your brother’s keeper. “We thank Almighty Allah for making it possible for us to witness today. I urge our people to have the fear of God, always. I also want to enjoin our parents and guardians to train their children with fairness and fear of God,” he added.
