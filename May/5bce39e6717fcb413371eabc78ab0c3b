Former Kaduna lawmaker, Senator Shehu Sani, has declared that some 2023 presidential aspirants are not serious. According to him, any aspirant who has not consulted across the 36 states is not serious about his ambition. The Kaduna State governorship aspirant claimed that most of the aspirants purchasing nomination forms are only playing game. In a post on his verified Facebook page, the former lawmaker said the aspirants are only concerned about picking forms, and erecting billboards. He said, “Most of the presidential aspirants are not serious. For the ruling party, they visit the Villa, buy form, erect billboards in Abuja and that’s it. “For the opposition party, they buy form, visit Minna and Ota, erect billboards in Abuja and that’s it. Any presidential aspirant who has not gone round the states is not to be taken seriously”.
