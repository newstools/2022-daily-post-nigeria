The parish priest of St. Pius X Parish in Ikot Abasi Akpan, Mkpat Enin Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State, Rev. Fr. Alphonsus Uboh, who was kidnapped on Sunday, May 8, 2022, at his residence has been freed after spending four days in the kidnappers’ den. A source within the parish, who pleaded anonymity, disclosed this on Thursday saying the priest was released around 2 a.m. today (Thursday) adding that he was not sure if any ransom was paid to the hoodlums. Recall that before his release, the Catholic Secretariat in Uyo had called for intense prayers from the faithful within and outside the Diocese of Uyo and also, men and women of goodwill to join in the prayers for Fr. Uboh’s quick release. A statement issued by the Diocesan Chancellor, Very Rev. Fr. Charles Ekeng, dated May 9, 2022 titled, “A Call for Prayers for Abducted Priest” conveyed the deep feelings of the Diocese over the abduction of the clergy at his parish residence. According to the statement, “it is with great pain that we officially confirm and announce to you the abduction of one of our priests, Very Rev. Fr. Alphonsus Uboh from his parish residence at St. Pius X Parish in Ikot Abasi Akpan, Mkpat Enin Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State. “The unfortunate event happened on Sunday May 8, 2022 after he returned to his residence from visiting a sick member”. Meanwhile, the Akwa Ibom State Police Public Relations Officer, Odiko Macdon, at the time of filing this report told journalists in a telephone interview that he was unaware of the priest’s release. He, however, promised to speak when he is officially briefed. “I have not been informed of the release of the Catholic priest; but I will speak when I am officially briefed”, he said.
