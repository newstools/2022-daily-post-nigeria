Former Scotland international, Ally McCoist has identified a lack of pace as Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku’s problem in Thomas Tuchel’s squad. Lukaku made a club-record £97.5 million switch from Inter Milan last summer to return to Stamford Bridge for a second spell. However, things have not gone according to plan, with Lukaku struggling for consistent form and scoring only eight goals in the Premier League so far this season. Speaking to talkSPORT, McCoist said, “I think he (Tuchel) has bigger problems at the other end. (His defence has been) absolutely decimated. (Antonio) Rudiger and (Andreas) Christensen away. “So, I am not going to say it is a rebuilding job, but he is going to have to restructure his defence totally. “Lukaku’s obviously another problem in that area of the park. He looks like he’s slightly off it, pace-wise. At that level, you can’t afford to be because you will get caught out.”
