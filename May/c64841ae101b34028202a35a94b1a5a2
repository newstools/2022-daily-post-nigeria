The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has charged northern leaders to subdue the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). A chieftain, Musa Saidu made the call in a statement on Saturday. Saidu is the leader of the Arewa community in the South-South and South East. He said IPOB activities were getting out of hand as “many innocent people are being attacked daily in the South-East.” “We have documentary evidence on killings across the South-East from 1992. Most of the victims are our people, the security agencies are aware of this.” Saidu also decried the gruesome murder of Fatima Jubril and her children last Sunday by suspected IPOB members. “The lady was killed without any provocation. We urge security agencies to go after the killers.” The ACF member advised the Anambra government to pay compensation to her family and ensure that the killers are apprehended. He believes President Muhammadu Buhari’s condemnation is not enough and insists on a decisive action “to prevent reprisals”. Saidu disclosed how the Arewa community in the South lodged several complaints on persistent IPOB attacks “without response”. He confirmed correspondence with the Northern Governors Forum, the Sultan of Sokoto and some eminent elders, “but the situation has continued unabated”. The ACF, however, reiterated its belief in Nigeria’s unity and appealed to Northerners to remain calm and law-abiding.
