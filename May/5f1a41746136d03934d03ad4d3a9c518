Some unidentified gunmen have thronged Karfi Village of Takai Local Government Area of Kano, killing six persons and abducting the village head, Yahya Illu. The gunmen in their numbers were said to have opened gunfire, hitting nine persons, six reportedly died while three are said to be critically injured. Confirming the incident, the State Police Spokesman, SP Haruna Kiyawa, said the gunmen entered Takai Karfi Village in Kano South about 90 kilometres away from the state capital. The Police Spokesman SP Haruna, said they have since dispatched a team of Crime Prevention Police Crack team, assuring that soon they would rescue the abducted village head. Kano South has been engulfed in insecurity with the base of the criminals around Falgore forest which links the state to Cameron and Chad Kiyawa explained that the gunmen entered Takai through Ringim forest which is vast and covers up to Jigawa State and other neighbouring states. Recall that Governor Ganduje had established a military training ground at Falgore forest, drastically reducing kidnapping and cattle rustling in the area.
