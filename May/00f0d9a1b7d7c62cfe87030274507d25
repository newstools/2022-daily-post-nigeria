Senator Orji Kalu (Abia North) has advised the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) not to extend the conduct of primary elections beyond June 3. The former Abia Governor gave the counsel in a statement on Wednesday amid calls for extension. The Senate Chief Whip also urged INEC to take disciplinary actions on any party that fails to meet up with the designated dates. He recalled that the electoral umpire made the dates known as early as February and kept reminding parties to the timetable. The lawmaker said it was embarrassing and speaks volumes of the indiscipline in Nigeria for any party to demand more time. “Most Nigerians do not respect and keep time, that is why appointments are not kept and people continue to give flimsy excuses”, he noted. “What have the political parties been doing since February? Is that how to behave in a country? What is the actual benefit of not keeping to rules?” Kalu told INEC to understand that if it succumbs to pressure, parties would still request further extension, thereby causing confusion. The Senate Chief Whip encouraged the commission “to stand firm on their decision and deliver as promised.”
