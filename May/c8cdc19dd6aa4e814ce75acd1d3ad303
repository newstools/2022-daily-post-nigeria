Vocal legal practitioner, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, has condemned the gruesome murder of Deborah Samuel. The 200 level student of Shehu Shagari College of Education in Sokoto State was burnt alive on Thursday. The deceased was accused of blasphemy against the Holy Prophet Muhammad (SAW). The Police have arrested two suspects. Adegboruwa advised the Nigerian Bar Association – Section on Public Interest and Development Law (NBA-SPIDEL) to cancel its conference to be held in Sokoto. In a statement, he urged the body not to hold the event in the state “where a Nigerian citizen has been brutally murdered and burnt to death”. “It is barbaric and lawyers should not be seen to be dancing on her grave in that State”, the Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) said. “We should make a statement to the government by canceling the conference and hold it in a neighboring state in the north.” The annual programme is scheduled to hold from Sunday, May 22 to Thursday, May 26, 2022. NBA-SPIDEL Publicity Secretary, Godfrey Echeho had announced Muiz Banire (SAN) as the Planning Committee Chairman; Sam Amadi is the vice.
