Two passengers lost their lives in a motor accident along Kachia-Kaduna expressway on Sunday. A Jos-bound Toyota with seven passengers had a head-on-collision with a trailer along Kurmi Jatau village as two persons died immediately. One of the passengers who is responding to treatment at an undisclosed hospital in Kaduna, Mr. Yahaya Suleiman said the accident was caused by over speeding. “When our driver took off from Kaduna, he was speeding, but we told him to slow down. “Although he listened to us, when we reached Kurmin Jatau village, after a few kilometers, close to where kidnappers usually attack passengers and motorists, he increased speed. “Unknown to him, there was a sharp bend, but he was speeding, regardless of the sharp bend, but unfortunately, collided with the trailer carrying cement,” he narrated The Kaduna State Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige, did not pick his calls, just as the Federal Road commander in the state phone was switched off.
