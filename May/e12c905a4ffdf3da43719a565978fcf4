Former Liverpool defender, Jose Enrique, has aimed a scathing attack on Chelsea centre-back, Andreas Christensen, after it emerged, he pulled out of the Blues’ FA Cup final squad hours before kick-off against Liverpool on Sunday. Christensen, who will join Barcelona at the end of the season, was not injured but told Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel on the morning of the game against Liverpool he did not want to be considered for the FA Cup final at Wembley because he did not feel ready to play. The Denmark international would likely have started the match ahead of Trevoh Chalobah if he was available for selection and his decision to pull out from the squad to face the Reds was a major blow to Chelsea’s plans. Chelsea equally lost 6-5 on penalty against Liverpool in the FA Cup final following a goalless draw. Reacting, Enrique in a post via his Instagram account, said: “Reports came in last night that defender Andreas Christensen was set to start the game but he ended up pulling out, leaving Trevoh Chalobah to step in at late notice, perhaps leaving him more unprepared than everyone else. “According to Football London as well, several members of the Chelsea team were ‘left shocked’ that Christensen pulled out. “I don’t know if this is true but if this is true is incredible that a player will do that. You are still under a contract. you are in a f***ing final. don’t (sic) do it for you but for your teammates, the club and the fans that have been supporting you the whole way.”
