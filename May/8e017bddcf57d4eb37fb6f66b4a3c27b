Troops of the Multinational Joint Task Force and Operation Hadin Kai, comprising of Nigerian and Nigerien troops have destroyed ten identified Boko Haram settlements in the North East and Lake Chad Basin. The operation, which started from Monguno on May 17, saw the troops clearing Boko Haram settlements at Grada, Daban Gajere, Kwatan Maishayi, Daban Karfe, Tumbun Buhari and Tunbun Abuja. This was disclosed in a statement by Lt. Col. Kamarudeen Adegoke, the Chief of Military Public Information. Adegoke reported that Boko Haram fled the cleared enclaves in a bid to avoid being killed by the troops, as no contact was made with the terrorists during the operation. He, however, said troops were able to recover some items in the cleared settlements, including assorted grains, packed fish in cartons, household items and a motorcycle. According to him, the enemy camps were destroyed and the items were properly burnt. He said that about 30 young men who claimed to be fishermen and farmers were arrested in the general area of Doron Naira, adding that they are being profiled and interrogated to ascertain their culpability or otherwise.
