The National Industrial Court, Abuja, has ordered the management of the National Examination Council, NECO, to immediately reinstate two senior staff sacked on the premise that the action was taken while the case was before it. The counsel to the dismissed staff of the examination body, which include Mr. Charles Berje and Dr. Anthonia Utoh, Job Okebe had filed a motion, praying the court for an order to reinstate his clients. Okebe asked the court for an order of mandatory injunction restraining the defendant from taking any further steps in the matter until the determination of the substantive suit. The defendant had terminated the employment of the 1st plaintiff and dismissed the 2nd plaintiff. Consequently, Justice Justice O.Y. Anuwe in his ruling, on Tuesday ordered the immediate reinstatement of the two dismissed staff, adding that in law since the matter is already in court, none of the parties is permitted to take any further action as it would put in jeopardy the court process. Describing the action of the defendant as a clear disrespect for the court, the trial judge said dismissing the two staff when the case is still pending in court was wrong, while warning against undermining its authority. It would be recalled that the court had in its earlier judgement in the suit marked, NICN/MN/06/2021 delivered on February 25, 2022 ordered the defendants to strictly comply with the Public Service Rules by giving equal and fair opportunities to all eligible and qualified staff of NECO including the plaintiffs. In its judgement, the court set aside the alleged promotion examination, which was held without the names of the plaintiffs, who were eligible for the examination but were unlawfully excluded. While the substantive suit was in the process the defendant went ahead and terminated the appointment of the 1st & 2nd plaintiff on the ground of having absconded from their duty post. Justice Anuwe then adjourned the main suit to October 24 for further hearing.
