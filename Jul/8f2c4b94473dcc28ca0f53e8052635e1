Bola Tinubu, the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, announced his running mate, Kashim Shettima yesterday. Tinubu unveiled Shettima after his meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari in Daura, Katsina State. His decision came after his placeholder, Kabiru Masari had stepped down from the role. With the deadline set for submission of running mates, Tinubu had sent Masari’s name to the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC. At some point, Tinubu made Nigerians believe that Masari was his running mate until yesterday when he disclosed his final decision. But, Nigerians had frowned at the decision of the APC presidential candidate to settle for a Muslim-Muslim ticket. However, a socio-political commentator, Deji Adeyanju, pointed out why Tinubu opted for a Muslim-Muslim ticket against the agitation from many Nigerians. Adeyanju suggested that lack of quality opposition in Nigeria made Tinubu opt for a Muslim-Muslim ticket. In a series of tweets, Adeyanju described opposition in Nigeria as useless and divided. According to Adeyanju: “The reason they can dare such a brazen move of Muslim-Muslim ticket is because they know the opposition is useless and divided. And they will win if the opposition doesn’t heed my wise counsel. “Tinubu and the APC are saying they don’t give a damn. The message of the Muslim-Muslim ticket is too loud. In fact, they are having a good laugh and with a divided opposition, they will laugh harder in February.”
