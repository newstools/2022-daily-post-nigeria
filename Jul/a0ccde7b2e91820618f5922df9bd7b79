Manchester United have released a statement on Friday, confirming that Cristiano Ronaldo will miss their preseason tour of Thailand as he continues to deal with a “family issue.” The 37-year-old will not be on the flight to Bangkok, which left Manchester at 4.30 pm UK time today. The statement read: “Cristiano Ronaldo will not be in the party departing for Thailand as he has been granted additional time off to deal with a family issue.” United will play Liverpool on July 12, before heading to Australia for fixtures against Melbourne Victory, Crystal Palace and Aston Villa. Erik ten Hag’s squad is due to return to Manchester on July 25. Ronaldo is desperate to leave Old Trafford this summer to join a club playing Champions League football next season.
