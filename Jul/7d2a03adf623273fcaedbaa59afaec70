The presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, Peter Obi, has opened up on his choice of running mate, insisting he preferred a younger person as vice-presidential candidate. Obi disclosed this while featuring on Arise TV Morning Show on Wednesday. The former Anambra governor said he prefers a younger person with a capable hand with something to offer to complement his ticket rather than recycling old hands who had been in the government before. Asked to clarify social media rumours that he had chosen Sen. Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed, a businessman and politician, as his vice-presidential candidate, Obi said he was yet to pick a running mate as consultations are still ongoing. Obi said, “We are talking to quite a number of people and Baba-Ahmed is a capable hand and I wish he is the one. But I wish I could work with somebody who is younger. “I prefer younger people with fresh ideas who have a lot to offer rather than recycling old hands. I want a competent person and I’m building a formidable team. “I want people who can look me in the eye and disagree with me during cabinet meetings. People who have their own minds and ideas. If you agree with me in three meetings, then you are gone because that means you don’t have your own ideas. I want people and cabinet members who can say, ‘Mr. President, you are wrong.”
