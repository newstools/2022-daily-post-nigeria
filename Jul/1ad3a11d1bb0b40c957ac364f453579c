Manchester United boss, Erik ten Hag has said that the club’s latest signing Tyrell Malacia ‘suits the profile’ of what a Red Devils star should be. Malacia became Ten Hag’s first signing of the summer when he completed his £13m move from Feyenoord this week. He said: “I think he’s the modern left-back or full-back. He suits the profile [we were looking for] and most important from every full-back is that he closes the right area,” he told Manchester United media. “He can also take part in the offensive side of our game, and he can do that really well. I think he will really contribute to the team.” Manchester United are on a pre-season tour of Asia, and flew out on Friday. United will play six friendlies across Thailand, Australia, Norway, and then back at Old Trafford in an extremely busy pre-season.
