Liverpool striker, Darwin Nunez, scored four goals for the club in their 5-0 victory over German top side, RB Leipzig in their pre-season friendly on Thursday evening. Mohamed Salah put the Reds ahead in the eighth minute and Nunez doubled their lead from the penalty spot in the 48th minute. Nunez scored his second of the night three minutes later and then completed his hat-trick with an assist from Harvey Elliott. The Uruguayan netted his fourth in the closing stages of the game following a brilliant piece of individual play from Fabio Carvalho. “I think everybody is really happy for him and was looking for him [in the dressing room afterwards],’ Liverpool defender Joel Matip said of Nunez after the game. “Great finish, great speed and the work he always put in, I think it will be really difficult for our opponents.”
