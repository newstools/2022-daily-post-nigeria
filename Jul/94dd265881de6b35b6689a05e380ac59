A Federal Capital Territory High Court, Abuja on Friday barred journalists from covering and witnessing the late gospel singer, Osinachi’s children’s testimony. This, according to the court, was a result of granting the three oral applications made by Aderonke Imana, the prosecution counsel, on June 22. The counsel filed the applications during the court hearing in the alleged culpable homicide case against Peter Nwachukwu, the late singer’s husband who is currently being remanded in prison. Osinachi, the Ekwueme crooner who died on April 8 as a result of alleged domestic violence, was buried on June 25 at her hometown Isochi Umunneochi in Abia State.
