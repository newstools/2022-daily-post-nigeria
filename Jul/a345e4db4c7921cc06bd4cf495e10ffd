A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), chieftain in Kaura Local Government Area of Kaduna State, Dr. Musa Alizuma, on Monday, claimed Nigerians are now living under the dictates and directives of bandits He alleged that the federal government is helpless and confused as the terrorists have continued to gain more ground while security agents are killed in numbers during attacks by the insurgents. Dr. Alizuma while reacting to the Tuesday night jailbreak in Kuje, expressed fear that one day, Nigerians will wake up and discover that President Muhammadu Buhari is kidnapped from the villa. “It’s going to be terrible in this country as the federal government fight only exists in the issuance of daily press releases of defeating bandits. ” In actual sense, from the look of things, is the Nigeria security architecture living up to the billing? Bandits will carry out attacks successfully. Do you think the federal government, has a say in the security of lives and properties? ” He asked. ”Nigeria is finished, as everyone is living in fear, including security agents. “Bandits recruit professionals, even aided by some bad elements in Army, Navy, police, and other security organization. But the military recruits young, fresh graduates without experience. There is trouble ahead” he expressed fears. Dr. Alizuma further said if bandits can attack the president’s convoy in his home state, it means, the bandits are up to something. “It’s either we go on our knees praying to God, or get ready to be subjected to whims and caprices of bandits. Over 1,000 inmates, including Boko Haram commanders, reportedly escaped from the Kuje correctional facility following a jailbreak.
