Arsenal legend, Paul Merson, has named his five favourite teams that could win the UEFA Champions League this upcoming 2022/23 season. Recall that Real Madrid won the Champions League last season after beating Liverpool in the final in Paris. Vinicius Jr. scored the only goal of the encounter to give the LaLiga champions their 14th Champions League trophy. However, Merson believes the likes of Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Barcelona are the five favourite clubs that can win the Champions League this term ahead of Real Madrid. He told Sportskeeda, “I just can’t wrap my head around what they [Real Madrid] did last season. Were they great, or did they just get lucky? “They were effectively out of the competition three times in the knockout stages against PSG, Chelsea and Manchester City but managed to defy the odds each time, while they prevailed in the final despite Liverpool playing better football and creating better chances.” He added, “I have a feeling we’ll see an all-English final this season because I genuinely believe the Premier League is head and shoulders above the rest of the domestic leagues in Europe. “Unless the draw puts two English sides against one another in one of the knockout rounds, I do think they will face each other in the final.” Naming his five favourite teams to win the Champions League, Merson added, “Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City.”
