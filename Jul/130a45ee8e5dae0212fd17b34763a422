State governors of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, have arrived in Osun State ahead of Saturday’s governorship election. The governors stormed the state for the PDP’s mega rally in favour of the party’s candidate in the election, Ademola Adeleke. Present in the state are Governors Douye Diri of Bayelsa State, Godwin Obaseki of Edo State, Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State, Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State, who is also the Vice presidential candidate of the party. Also present is the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar and former Senate President, Bukola Saraki. However, Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State is noticeably absent. Wike is aggrieved with PDP’s leadership over the choice of Okowa as Atiku’s running mate. The Rivers governor, who came second during the party’s presidential primary, was believed to have been eyeing the Vice Presidential slot which went to Okowa.
