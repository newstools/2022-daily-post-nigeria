The New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) has suspended its chairman in Bauchi, Sani Shehu. North East Zonal Secretary, Babayo Liman made the announcement at a news briefing on Wednesday. Liman said Shehu was sanctioned for arrogance, disrespect to party leadership and lack of commitment to NNPP’s ideals. The scribe said after reviewing the allegations against the acting chairman, he was issued a query. “He refused to collect the query and we had no other option than to suspend him from office to move the party forward,” Liman explained. In his response, Shehu stated that he was not aware of the development. “I am not aware and I have nothing to do with the said suspension. “I remain the acting chairman of the party in Bauchi state”, NAN quoted him saying.
