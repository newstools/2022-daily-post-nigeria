Nollywood actor, Kenneth Okonkwo has said that the All Progressives Congress, APC, and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, are rattled by Peter Obi’s movement, the ‘Obidients’. Okonkwo said this on Thursday in an interview with Arise Tv while commenting on the PDP and the APC describing Peter Obi’s movement as a social media trend. DAILY POST recalls that Okonkwo dumped the ruling party a few days ago following the decision to have a Muslim-Muslim ticket for the 2023 presidential election. The actor said the ruling party was the originator of “internet sensation” before being voted into power in 2015. He said: I’m yet to join another political party, but I’m Obicentric. The power of marketing starts with gaining attention and Peter Obi’s team is doing that perfectly. “APC were the originators of internet sensation so why are they crying if it’s not making any impact. “Marketing is by getting attention and Obidients are doing it well, that’s why APC and PDP are rattled.”
