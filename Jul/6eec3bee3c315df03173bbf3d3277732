The Governorship candidate of the African Democratic Congress, ADC, Akwa Ibom State, Ezekiel Nya-Etok has asked Nigerians to look beyond political party or zone and consider a candidate who has the capacity to turn around the fortunes of the nation. The Governorship candidate stated this in a press briefing over the weekend ahead of the unveiling of the ADC centre in Uyo which he said would be made available free of charge to members of the society irrespective of party preferences. He, however, wondered why people still vote party instead of the credibility of a candidate and what the person will offer to the people in terms of governance regretting that, such has made the people remain where they are. According to him, “we are where we are today because of our insincerity, we know that someone does not have the capacity to solve our problem, yet we still want to vote for the person because of the political party. Governance is not rocket science. “Zoning is one of the biggest evils and deterrent of progress, zoning has never helped us. All the three Senatorial districts of Uyo, Ikot Ekpene, and Eket in Akwa Ibom have produced a governor. Time has come when we should not be saying it must be this zone, whosoever that will change the fortunes of the people should be considered” Asked why he did not join the ruling PDP to actualize his dream he said, “being in PDP is just like political suicide, PDP will never take you on account of what you have to offer, it’s about who likes you or does not like you so it is a silly and unreasonable thing to join a platform like that. “How can I go to an exam that I don’t know about it, with no marking scheme? Do you want to tell me that the one PDP brought is the most qualified, the most loved, the most competent? No! the only way I can join PDP is when I’m the governor’s anointed, which is not possible, nothing would have made the governor give me the ticket, sometimes it’s understandable.” He said.
