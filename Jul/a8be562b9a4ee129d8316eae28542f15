The Peoples Democratic Party (2023) Presidential candidate, former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar has lamented that Nigerians have never had it this horrible. Atiku, in a statement Sunday, said the next year’s election is a national rescue mission. The Waziri Adamawa said Nigerians owed the country a duty to vote in the 2023 election and vote out the failed APC. “As citizens of this great country, we owe Nigeria a duty to vote in the election and every ballot cast in that election should count as a referendum on the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC),” he stated. Atiku explained that his idea about politics is that it is a system that seeks to organise a society towards a common good. He also lamented that what the APC had done with the country in the past 7 years was horrible. The statement partly read, “In the 16 years that our great party, the Peoples Democratic Party governed this country, not a single day came with a nightmare that the APC has continued to make us live through. “Taking Nigeria out of the cesspit that the APC has thrown us into will require leadership with forthrightness and a clear vision to chart a new direction into a future of prosperity and peace – the very mantra of our anthem. We should not reward the APC for their failures and we should reject a discredited leadership with no clear agenda”. He urged Nigerians to work in unison towards rebuilding the country into a nation of one people, with one future.
