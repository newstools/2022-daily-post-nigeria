The Human and Environmental Development Agenda (HEDA Resource Centre), on Sunday, urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to obey the provisions of the Electoral Act 2022 and its guidelines strictly. HEDA stated this against the backdrop of controversies surrounding the availability, validity or otherwise of certificates of candidates seeking elective positions in Nigeria ahead of the 2023 general elections. This was contained in a statement signed by Mr Olanrewaju Suraju, the Chairman, HEDA, and made available to NAN in Lagos. Suraju said, “We are not unaware of every crooked game plan and shenanigans by some politicians regarding their eligibility or otherwise to run for different positions. “We have seen different unfounded moonlight tales by either elected or appointed persons about the whereabouts of their credentials and how the court adjudicated those matters. “As a leading Anti-Corruption Organisation and Non-partisan Human Rights and Development League, we call on INEC to be guided by the provisions of the Electoral Act and its guidelines.” Suraju also urged the INEC to reject the submission of affidavits in place of certificates by candidates because of the several controversies around swearing of affidavits which are well known to the Commission. He said, “We have been keenly following the developments around the submission of candidates’ names and credentials list for the 2023 general elections by political parties. “The most recent news is that of candidates claiming their school certificates are missing. “We believe that the commission’s guidelines towards preparation for the 2023 general elections to political parties and the public are clear enough on presentation of certificates.”
