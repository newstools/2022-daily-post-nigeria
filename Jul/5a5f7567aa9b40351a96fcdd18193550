Prof Greg Ibe, the governorship standard bearer of the All Progressives Grand Alliance in Abia State, has picked the member representing Aba South Constituency in the Abia State House of Assembly, Hon Obinna Ichita as his running mate for the forthcoming general election in 2023. Mr Ichita is the APGA leader in Abia State and the only APGA lawmaker in the State House of Assembly. However, Prof Ibe, while unveiling his running-mate in a statement issued to journalists in Umuahia, on Saturday, hinged the choice of Hon Obinna Ichita, after an extensive, rigorous and painstaking screening exercise conducted by the party among many aspirants initially, which finally culminated in the nomination of three eminently qualified Abia people, from whom the latter emerged. He hinted that the party adhered strictly to the existing guidelines, protocols, due process and ground rules, which among many criteria provide for specific functions and contributions by different organs of the party at State Working Committee and National Working Committee levels in collaboration and consultation with the candidate, in arriving at the decision. According to the APGA gubernatorial candidate, some of the considerations which influenced the emergence of Ichita includes is during membership of APGA even during turbulent periods, sterling performance as leader of the party in the house of Assembly, equalizing senatorial zone of origin and public acceptability and grassroots support. “It is believed that he will bring his vast legislative experience to bear on the ticket while fusing with Prof Ibe’s robust background in business, academia and international diplomacy to reposition Abia”, the release added.
