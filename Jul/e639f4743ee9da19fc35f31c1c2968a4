Manchester United could be set to sign Ivan Toney this summer, according to the UK Mirror. Toney is also attracting attention from other Premier League sides like Leeds, Newcastle United and West Ham. Last season, the 26-year-old netted 14 times and provided six assists. Toney played for six months with Christian Eriksen’s last campaign, but the Denmark international has sealed a move as a free agent to United. However, United’s decision to step up their interest to sign Toney could depend on the futures of Cristiano Ronaldo and Anthony Martial. Ronaldo has already submitted a transfer request at Old Trafford and is yet to report for preseason training under Erik ten Hag. The 37-year-old is not happy with the club’s transfer activity and also wants to play Champions League football. Martial went to Sevilla on loan in January and could still leave the Red Devils ahead of next season.
