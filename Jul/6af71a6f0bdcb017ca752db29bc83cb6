An aide to President Muhammadu Buhari, Lauretta Onochie, has asked members of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to stop repeating some angry words uttered by the party’s presidential candidate during his campaign for the ticket. Onochie said repeating those words keeps the wounds fresh, saying many are hurting. She said Tinubu himself have started reaching out to those who contested the ticket with him because Buhari told him to be magnanimous in victory. Onochie said it would be childish on their part to keep throwing those words around and keeping the wounds still fresh. She advised party loyalists to move on from those days when the party was very balkanized along lines of different aspirants, saying “we need everybody to come on board.” Her words: “When President Buhari said the aspirant who wins the presidential candidacy of APC must be magnanimous in victory, Sen. Bola Ahmed Tinubu took him seriously and reached out to those who ran with him in the Presidential Primary race. He reached out to them. “We too must act as adults if we are going to win everyone back. It’s not right to keep repeating those words said in anger by our leader, Asiwaju. This is because many of our people are still hurting. It’s childish on our part, to keep throwing those words around and keeping the wounds still fresh. “Let’s move on from those days when the camp was balkanised along lines of different aspirants. We need EVERYONE OF OUR PEOPLE TO COME ON BOARD. Some are reluctant because we are still throwing those words in their faces, constantly. “Like our leader, Asiwaju himself has done, reaching out to those he defeated, let’s be magnanimous in victory by reaching out in a matured way to everyone we know. “That’s what I’ve been doing, anyway. The result has been amazing. Together, we will win.”
