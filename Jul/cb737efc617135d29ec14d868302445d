Local Government Council Chairmen in Akwa Ibom State have rejected the proposed enactment of a bill to regulate outdoor advertising platforms by the State House of Assembly. The bill, if enacted, would ensure that any person who wishes to establish or operate any billboard or commercial advertising outfit must be a member of a recognized body or get permission from the Akwa Ibom State Ministry of Environment. But the council Chairmen, speaking through the Chairman of the Association of Local Government of Nigeria (ALGON), the state chapter Hon. Iniobong Robson at a public hearing, insisted that the enactment of such a bill would trample on the rights of Local governments and would be a complete departure from the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended). Robson added that Local Government Councils in Nigeria are constitutionally empowered with regulatory power for outdoor structures and advertisement, stressing that Nigeria’s constitution is supreme. He said, “It is worrisome the move by the Ministry of Environment to trample on the constitutional powers of the local government councils to regulate outdoor advertisement in the state. We will stop at nothing to arrest and prosecute anyone who tries to encroach on our rights other than our authorized agents.” The Chairman, however, called on the state Ministry of Environment to liaise with council Chairmen to see how to address the issue. Earlier, the Deputy Chairman of the House of Assembly Committee on Environment; Rt. Hon. Mark Esset, who presided over the event, said all the contributions will be deliberated at the committee level before the report will be sent to the House. Among the Council Chairmen who attended the event were Hon. (Barr.) Etetim Onuk; Itu, Hon. (Dr.) Uwemedimo Udo; Uyo.
