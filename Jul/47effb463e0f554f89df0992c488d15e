Arsenal legend, Charlie Nicholas has predicted that striker Gabriel Jesus will score at least 20 goals in the Premier League next season for the Gunners. Jesus is all set to join Arsenal from Manchester City, having undergone his medical earlier this week. The Brazilian international is expected to wear the No. 9 shirt at Mikel Arteta’s side. “Whether Gabriel Jesus is the kind of player Arsenal need right now is entirely down to the individual opinion,” Nicholas told Bonus Code Bets. “Arsenal really need a finisher, someone who gets into the box. But with the way Mikel Arteta wants to play, I don’t know whether a number nine can be like that. “That is why Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was such a good goal scorer. He wasn’t a proper nine, he was a number 11 playing off the flanks with his pace.” He added, “I am very mixed in the Gabriel Jesus debate. Under Pep Guardiola, he was not a favourite and didn’t always play, but if they get him at a decent price, I would be amazed if he doesn’t score at least 20 goals in the league for Arsenal. “That is what Jesus likes to do. He likes to play around the edge of the box, with a lovely burst of pace, and that is what Arsenal miss.”
