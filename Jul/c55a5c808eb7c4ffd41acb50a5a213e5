A Tanzanian Pastor, Allen Mziray, has claimed that the late famous Nigerian singer, Osinachi Nwachukwu is in hell fire. Mziray claimed that God informed him that Nwachukwu was in hell fire due to disobedience. DAILY POST reported that Osinachi was buried in Abia State a few days ago. The Ekweueme crooner was alleged to have been killed by her husband, Peter Nwachukwu, after he subjected her to domestic violence. But, Nwachukwu had denied killing the mother of his children, stressing that she died of lung cancer. Allen said God told him that the late singer failed to make heaven for using the instruments of Jezebel. In a Facebook post on Monday titled, ‘Osinachi Nwachukwu is in hellfire for disobedience,’ Allen claimed God told him these things during a vigil. He added that God warned Osinachi severally to change her ways, but she refused. The post reads: “A few days ago, we were in a vigil prayer in the church when suddenly the Lord appeared, and he told me, Allen, what is the latest news about the gospel singer, Osinachi Nwachukwu? “I told the lord “very recently, I saw a Youtube story that they were performing a burial ceremony; I saw the coffin in the church which I believe they were going to bury her at last. “The Lord said to me, “go and speak about this again, tell my children what happened. Osinachi is in hellfire for disobedience. I warned her, but she never wanted to listen to me. “I warned her many times through different ways, but still she did not listen to me; she just kept hardening her heart and using these instruments of Jezebel. She’s now in hellfire suffering great torment; she is burning in fire because of the property of Jezebel she was using.”
