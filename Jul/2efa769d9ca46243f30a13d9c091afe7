Arsenal legend, Ray Parlour has given his verdict on the signing of Zinchenko from Manchester City The Gunners have agreed a £32m deal with Manchester City for the Ukraine international and had no issues reaching personal terms with the player. Zinchenko, who was in Texas with Manchester City, has flown straight to Orlando to join up with Arsenal squad to continue his pre-season schedule after passing his medical. Zinchenko made 128 appearances for Manchester City in all competitions during his six-year spell at the Etihad and won the league title four times. Pep Guardiola fixed the Ukrainian in different positions, including in midfield and defence during his time at the Etihad. “That would be a great move. “We need a bit of cover on that left-hand side. Zinchenko, he can play different positions as well, so that would be a fantastic signing if they can get him over the line,” Parlour told Sky Sports.
