A fire disaster which occurred in Ilorin, Kwara State capital on Monday has destroyed property worth millions of naira. Eleven out of 86 shops were consumed by the fire which occurred at the Balogun Alanamu market in the Ilorin West Local Government Area of the state. The firefighter’s team leader who rescued the situation, said “there was no one in the market even the security guards to notice the fire outbreak on time. “A passerby bike man was the one who saw the ravaging inferno and quickly summoned the state fire service to rescue the situation,” the leading fire officer said. However, firemen did everything possible to immediately stop the spread of the burning fire to the other shops and subsequently brought the fire under control. Out of 86 shops in the market arena, 11 shops were affected by the fire incident which occurred at about 5.08am, according to the spokesman of the state fire service, Hassan Adekunle in a statement in Ilorin on Monday. He said the cause of the fire outbreak was suspected to be an electric power surge. The Director, Kwara State Fire Service, Prince Falade John Olumuyiwa, urged the general public especially the market people to be more safety conscious.
