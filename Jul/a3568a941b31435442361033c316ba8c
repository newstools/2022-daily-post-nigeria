A 14-year-old girl has allegedly jumped down from a four-storey building to avoid being flogged by her guardian. DAILY POST gathered that the incident happened in Awada, a highly populated neighbourhood in Onitsha, Anambra State. A source said the girl, Ijeoma Nwafor, is a housemaid to a woman, whose name was given as Nnenna Onwanna, who was used to beating her at every slight opportunity. She, however, survived the jump and is currently said to be receiving treatment in an undisclosed hospital in Onitsha. “They live on the fourth floor of a house in Awada, and she was beating her on Saturday when she ran out of the house, and in a bid to escape, she jumped down from the four-storey and landed on the fence, fitted with security wires. “She, however, survived as she was pulled out by some residents of the area and was promptly rushed to the hospital for medical attention.” Meanwhile, police authorities in the state have confirmed the incident, saying that the woman has been arrested.
