Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has named defender, Kalidou Koulibaly as the best player on the pitch after his side’s 4-0 defeat to Arsenal in a pre-season Florida Cup final on Sunday. Tuchel watched as Arsenal demolished Chelsea at the Camping World Stadium in the USA. Four goals from Gabriel Jesus, Martin Odegaard, Bukayo Saka and Albert Sambi Lokonga gave Mikel Artea’s side the victory over their Premier League London rivals. Asked about Koulibaly, who made his debut for Chelsea, Tuchel said at his post-match press conference after the game, “He was the best player on the pitch for us.” Chelsea recently signed Koulibaly from Italian Serie A club, Napoli. The Senegal international was Chelsea’s major second summer signing in the ongoing summer transfer window.
