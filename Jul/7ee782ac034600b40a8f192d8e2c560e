The police in Ogun State said they have gathered intelligence that some suspected cultists are planning to mark what they called ‘7/7′ on Thursday, being July 7, 2022. According to the police, the event may “result in blood-letting and wanton destruction of properties.” As a result, the Ogun State police command has warned those with such “devilish intentions” to nip same in the bud as such move will be met with strong resistance from security agencies. Abimbola Oyeyemi, the Police Public Relations Officer in Ogun State, said on Monday that all the command’s tactical squads, the DPOs and Area Commanders have been put on red alert to deal with any act capable of undermining the security of the State. According to Oyeyemi, the full weight of the law will descend on members of any unlawful society planning to perpetrate evil in the Gateway State, saying the police would not allow some misguided and unscrupulous elements to make life difficult for law-abiding Ogun residents. While appealing to parents to warn their children to steer clear of any unlawful gathering before and after July 7, hoteliers are also warned to prevent their facilities from being used for any cult-related gathering so as to avoid being prosecuted. —
