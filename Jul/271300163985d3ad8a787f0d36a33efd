A Russian aircraft has attacked Snake Island some hours after Ukraine mounted its flag. Both the Russian Defense Ministry and the Ukrainian armed forces confirmed the attack. “At dawn, during an aerial overflight and reconnaissance of Zmiiny (Snake) island, it was attacked by 2 air-launched missiles. The dock was significantly damaged,” the Ukrainian military said. The Russian Ministry of Defense stated, according to the state news agency RIA Novosti: “Against the backdrop of military failures and a massive retreat of Ukrainian troops in the Donbas, the Kyiv regime made an attempt to symbolically deliver the flag to Snake Island tonight. “A Russian Air Forces aircraft immediately launched a missile attack on the island, as a result, some of the Ukrainian military personnel were destroyed, the rest fled.” The Ukrainian military made no mention of casualties. Serhii Bratchuk, spokesman of the Odessa military administration, said earlier that the Ukrainian flag had been installed on Snake Island. Russian forces left the island last week after occupying it since the beginning of the invasion in February. Russian positions had sustained repeated strikes by Ukrainian forces in the previous weeks.
