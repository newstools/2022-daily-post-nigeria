As the Eid-el-Kabir festival approaches, Muslim faithful are lamenting the high cost of rams, foodstuff and other necessities. Although the prices of those essential materials had increased in the past, an additional 50 percent increase has been noticed since the Sallah approaches. Some Muslims interviewed in the ancient city of Kaduna, told DAILY POST that even though many of them who are used to slaughtering animals to commemorate the season are still hopeful of buying the sacrificial animal, some of them said their poor economic status amid rising inflation are threatening to mar this year’s celebration. Although this year’s celebration is expected to hold on Saturday, July 9, many are yet to make provision to buy those necessities. According to Alhaji Musa Yakodo, sheep, goats, cows or camels are allowed to be used for the sacrifice, even though many people prefer to use ram because of the enormous reward it attracts from Allah. He said the prices of rams have shot up to between 70 and 90 per cent in most parts of the country. Also speaking, Alhaji Musa Abilewa, said the fear of insecurity has stopped many livestock traders from traveling to bush to buy those animals for resale, adding that the few available animals are so expensive. He said the price of a medium-sized ram, which cost N30,000 in 2019 and 2020, is now going for N50,000, while the large-size ram of N250,000 has gone up to N400,000 within the same period. Malam Sunusi Usman, who sells at the popular Zango animal market in Tudun Wada, Kaduna metropolis, said the animals were available, but buyers were not forthcoming. He added that the prices ranged between N50,000 for medium sizes and N400,000 for very large rams. “Honestly, if you want a good ram for Eid this year, you should have from N50,000 to N60,000. These are medium-sized and good rams, but if you need big rams, then you need from N100,000 to N400,000,” he said. Hajiya Halima Sani Mariam, a resident of Kakuri Kaduna, said she has visited several roadside ram vendors; and discovered that the lowest prices were between N60,000 and N75,000. Also Usman Hamisu, who bought two rams at N200,000, said one of them cost N80,000 and the other N120,000. As it stands, the price of ram, foodstuff and other ingredients may not shift the Sallah celebrations from July 9, 2022 as many joyful Muslims await the day.
