Southampton new boy, Joe Aribo, has said he had long conversations with Saints manager, Ralph Hasenhuttl on his playing position at the club. Aribo linked up with the Premier League outfit on a four-year contract on Saturday ending his three-year stay at Scottish Premiership club, Glasgow Rangers. Rangers received £6m fee, which could rise to £10m in add-ons. Naturally, a central midfielder, Aribo operated in advanced positions behind the striker and as a centre-forward for Rangers last season. “I have had a few. He asked me where I prefer to play most. I told him just behind the striker in the right forward position,” Aribo told the club’s website when quizzed on whether he had conversations with Hasenhuttl about his role in Saints’ system “He said that it was really good I said that to him and not in another position, so we have had a lot of chats about it.” Asked to describe himself as a player, the London-born star replied: “I am someone that likes to run at defenders. I sometimes like to play key passes. I like to get on the scoresheet – I like to score a lot of goals.” Aribo is expected to travel with his new teammates to Austria for their pre-season training tour on Wednesday.
