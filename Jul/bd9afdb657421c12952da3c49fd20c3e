Released victims of the Abuja-Kaduna train attack that took place on 28th March 2022, have confessed that they were well and their captives even slaughtered six cows and fed them throughout their three months of captivity. Seven victims of the train attack were released on Saturday, while 44 victims, including four children and an 85-year-old woman, are still in the den of the bandits. Muhammad Daiyabu, who spoke on behalf of the other released victims with newsmen in Kaduna and whose pregnant wife was earlier released, dismissed reports that victims were bitten by snakes, stressing that they killed about 10 snakes and two scorpions within the enclave. He further explained that most of the snakes were killed by their captors, adding that the information that they were bitten by snakes is false. According to him, “My mother, who is battling with high blood pressure, almost collapsed when she heard that the victims were being bitten by snakes.” He affirmed that one of the captives was shot through an accidental discharge by one of their captors’ children while playing with a gun, explaining that the bullet brushed one of the abductees on the stomach and the abductors were very worried when the incident happened and they apologized for it. Daiyabu stated that false reports were circulated in the media, saying that the reports caused more harm than good for the victims still in captivity. He, therefore, appealed to the government to meet their demands so that the remaining victims can be freed, saying that the most worrisome part is the fate of the remaining people left in the bush.
