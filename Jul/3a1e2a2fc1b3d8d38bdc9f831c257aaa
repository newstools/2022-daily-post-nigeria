Mauricio Pochettino has penned an emotional farewell message to Paris Saint-Germain after his sacking from the club was confirmed on Tuesday. Following months of speculation, Pochettino was finally sacked by PSG earlier today after his failure to win the UEFA Champions League last season. The Argentine did win the French Ligue 1 title for PSG last season. The former Tottenham Hotspur coach was replaced by Christophe Galtier. However, taking to his Instagram account, Pochettino reflected back on his year-and-a-half reign at PSG. He wrote on Twitter: “I want to wish everyone at PSG the very best for the future – the owners, the board, the players, all the staff and the supporters. “To Nasser [Al Khelaifi, club president] – I want to say thank you for giving me the opportunity to be part of the PSG family again. “We are proud to finish as league champions at a club that has meant so much to me and my family, from my time here as a player and a captain, and now as a coach. “A bientot, Mauricio.”
