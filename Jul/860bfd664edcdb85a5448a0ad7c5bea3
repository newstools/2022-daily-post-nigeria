Peter Obi Support Network (PSON) has accused Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-rufai, of preventing a Northern meeting in support of Peter Obi. The followers of the Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate planned to use the popular Arewa House on Rabah Road. In a statement on Monday, the POSN lamented that they had fallen victims of power misuse. The spokesman, Sani Saeed Altukry said the venue’s manager “called to notify that we cannot have Peter/Datti Northern Summit in Arewa House”. Noting that the programme was scheduled for Tuesday, Altukry said no reason was given for the refusal. “The governor issued a directive cancelling the use of the venue after the group had paid for its use. “The decision is disheartening at the critical point when Northern Nigerians are desperate for development and liberation from poverty.” Altukry added that “the Peoples Movement which Peter Obi represents” will not bow to “intimidation aimed at suppressing the liberation of the North”. The POSN charged “all oppressed Nigerians and everyone that desires good governance” to keep their spirits high ahead of the 2023 elections.
