Gunmen suspected to be bandits have reportedly invaded Ganun-Gari community, Birnin Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State, killing one person and injuring three others. A resident of the area, Ibrahim Musa told DAILY POST, in Kaduna on Monday, that the incident happened on Sunday at exactly 1.00am, as the bandits shot sporadically, to create fear among the residents. He said the bandits rustled several cows and stole foodstuffs from the nearby village of Dawakin Bassa community in the same LGA. Confirming the attack on Monday, Chairman Birnin-Gwari Vanguards for Security and Good Governance, said it alerted residents of the community about the large movement of the bandits from neighbouring Zamfara forests to Tudun-Wada Sabon Layi. According to him, the bandits will retreat to their base after the operation at Dawakin Bassa through the same route they followed. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Mohammed Jalige, did not pick his calls to confirm or refute the news.
