The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Ogun State has threatened to prosecute dangerous drivers during the forthcoming Eid-il-Kabir festival. FRSC said it has deployed 2,000 personnel to man critical corridors across Ogun State so as to stem the tide of road crashes during the celebration. To guarantee safe travels for all road users before and after the 2022 Eid celebration, the FRSC in Ogun said it would commence a special patrol operation on Wednesday. This special operation, DAILY POST learnt, is organized to avert “the chaos that characterized the road during such celebrations.” Spokesperson of the FRSC in Ogun, Florence Okpe, said in a statement that the special operations would focus on, “use of phone while driving; wrongful overtaking; excessive speed; seat belt violation; passengers’ manifest by commercial vehicles; dangerous driving and use of alcohol while driving.” Okpe added that traffic control areas are to be manned by FRSC operatives, who are to be assisted by sister security and emergency agencies to ensure easy intervention to traffic distress. She disclosed that FRSC ambulance points that are located at different corridors in addition to night rescue teams at various FRSC formations would operate 24 hours for rescue operations. While embarking on motor parks public enlightenment campaigns, motorists traveling during this period are advised to adhere to traffic rules and regulations. Meanwhile, the FRSC Sector in Ogun, Ahmed Umar, has appealed to motorists to use the road responsibly by considering other road users and obeying traffic rules. Umar warned that “any motorists apprehended flouting traffic rules may be treated as driving dangerously and could be prosecuted.”
