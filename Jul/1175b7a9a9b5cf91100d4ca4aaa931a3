He, therefore tasked stakeholders of the PDP across the 329 wards of the state to embrace and integrate the returning politicians to the party He said, “In all the 329 wards of the state we are receiving 20,000 people returning to the party and there’s no way we could have done that at one location. “What we are doing today is also to reassure the people that this is a PDP state and that we are ready to hold the ground and win the game.” Speaking on behalf of decampees from the APC in Onna, a former Vice Chairman of Onna Local Government Council and chapter Secretary of the APC, Hon.
