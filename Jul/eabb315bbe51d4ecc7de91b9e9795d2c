Dr Hassan Suleiman, the Director of Universal Basic Education Board (UBEB), has recounted his experience while in the den of his captors after regaining freedom from the Abuja-Kaduna bound train attackers recently. The FCT UBEC boss, in an audio message he released on WhatsApp, explained that it was all hell being in the terrorists’ den for about 100 days, stressing that he do not wish his greatest enemy to be there. Suleiman, who was on his way to Kaduna on 28th March, 2022, to attend an education programme organized by FCT UBEB, was abducted alongside others by the terrorists. He expressed gratitude to God Almighty that he did not sustain any injury during the attack, regretting that some who sustained injuries during the attack lost their lives. He thanked members of the All Nigeria Conference of Principals of Secondary, ANCOPPS, as well as other well wishers for their concern and prayers throughout the trying period. He said, “Good morning, my brothers and sisters in FCT ANCOPPS, and other well wishers. This is Dr Hassan Sule, I just want to extend my warm appreciation over prayers that led to our release by terrorists on Saturday.”
