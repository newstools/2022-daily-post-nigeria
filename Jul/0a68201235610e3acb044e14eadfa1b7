Jide Adediran, the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Lagos State, has provided his reasons for the choice of Nollywood actress, Funke Akinfele as running mate. Miss Akindele, popularly known as Jenifa, confirmed her nomination as the deputy gubernatorial candidate of the PDP on Tuesday. The actress said she would be putting a hold on her acting career and focus on politics to cause a change to improve the welfare of Lagosians. Confirming her nomination, Adediran explained that he picked not just an actress, but a filmmaker and a lawyer, who has been creating jobs for Nigerian youths for many years now. Speaking on Channels Television’s Politics Today, the Lagos PDP governorship flagbearer said, “My running mate, Funke Akinfele, people call her an actress, but I’ll say I picked a lawyer who found love in film making. “Beyond an actress, she’s a filmmaker. Someone who has grown her business from zero to something…and has won massive followership in the process of what she’s been doing for years. “An Ikrodu-born diva whom I believe is going to add value to my candidacy… some people are forgetting that the purpose upon which a political party is established is to win elections. “My running mate is a brand that connects the grassroot and my people in the cyberspace. “So, a combination of that force already spelt doom for the Lagos APC in 2023. In Lagos, what we have is an unusual situation and it requires an unusual solution. This is why we have presented to Lagosians a total departure from the norm. This is something fresh.”
