Aisha Yesufu, a popular socio-political activist, has condemned the decision of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, to pick a Muslim running mate. Tinubu had earlier on Sunday in Daura, Katsina State, announced former governor of Borno State, Kashim Shettima, as his running mate. The former Lagos State governor said he settled for Shettima based on his competence and ability to deliver. Reacting to the development, Aisha, who is co-convener of BringBackOurGirls, BBOG, advocacy group, said the decision was an impunity of the worst kind, adding that it variance with the principles of justice and equity. She wrote on Twitter: “A Muslim-Muslim ticket is an insult to fairness, equity and justice. It is see finish. It is impunity of the worst kind. It is disrespect to people of the federal Republic of Nigeria. It shows they have little regards for people and think their structure is more valuable. “The present disastrous President in office is a Muslim who has gathered other Muslims in a very unfair & disproportionate manner around him to lead the country into the sorry state it is in. People have been crying about this unfairness & his party presents Muslim-Muslim ticket!” [sic].
