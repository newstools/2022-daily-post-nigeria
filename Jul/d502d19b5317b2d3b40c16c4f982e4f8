Argentina international, Paulo Dybala, has made a transfer U-turn, amid interest from Premier League clubs. Dybala is now willing to consider a move to the Premier League, opening the door to the possibility he could replace forward Cristiano Ronaldo at Manchester United. The 28-year-old has been without a club since leaving Juventus at the end of his contract this summer. His preference had been to remain in Italy, with Inter Milan widely considered front-runners for his signature. However, according to Sky Sport Italia, no offers have materialised from Serie A clubs and Dybala is now ready to evaluate offers from England and Spain instead. Dybala would prefer a move to the Premier League over La Liga and both Man United and Arsenal are believed to have already made contact with his agent. Man United’s interest in Dybala is now expected to ramp up in the coming days should the Red Devils allow Ronaldo to leave Old Trafford.
