A popular Nigerian cleric, Pastor Adewale Giwa, has said for the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar to win the forthcoming general election, the stance on the Governor of Rivers State must be reconsidered. Giwa who is the Senior Pastor of the Awaiting the Second Coming of Jesus Christ Ministry, Akure, Ondo State, warned that shoving Wike who emerged second during the primary of the party aside portends danger for the party in the 2023 poll. Pastor Giwa said if Wike had become the running mate to Atiku, the election would be an easy ride for PDP, stressing that it was never too late for the party and its candidate to reconsider the move. While emphasising that Wike has paid his dues enormously to the party, Giwa said Atiku’s running mate, Ifeanyi Okowa is not in the same political status as Wike. He added that the political career of Atiku lies with Wike which could mar his ambition if not properly handled. “Atiku’s political career might end if Wike leaves PDP. When the party was collapsing, it was Wike who rescued the party. “Even majority of Nigerians were thinking that Atiku would pick Wike, not even within the People’s Democratic Party. So, if Wike leaves the PDP, that might ends Atiku’s political career “Wike is a politician to reckon with in the PDP. The young man has every reason to be upset. Atiku has made the greatest mistake that might end his political career if care is not taken. Atiku should put aside his pride and go hold on Wike’s legs and beg him. “I am sure the nation’s political observers must have thought that Atiku would go for Wike. I can understand that Atiku he is probably afraid of him, thinking that Wike won’t be easy to push over.”
