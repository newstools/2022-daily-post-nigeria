The Yola Division of the Federal High Court has reserved judgement in the case instituted by former chairman of Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Nuhu Ribadu against the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship Candidate for Adamawa State, Aishatu Ahmed (Binani). Nuhu Ribadu, who was one of those who contested for the Adamawa APC governorship ticket and lost out to Binani, had gone to court thereafter to complain of over-voting and to ask that Binani’s victory be overturned. The Federal High Court 1 in Yola on Wednesday reserved the suit for judgement at a later date. The presiding judge, Justice Abdulazeez Anka, said the date for judgement will be communicated to the parties involved. DAILY POST recalls that in the APC governorship primary election conducted in Yola on May 27, 2022, Binani had polled 430 votes against the 288 garnered by Ribadu who was her closest rival. Four other aspirants had also scored votes, all of which were collated but found to be supposedly two votes more than accredited delegates. The committee which conducted the primary had said the five delegates from a particular LGA were not accounted for and that the outcome was actually three votes less than expected delegates, but Ribadu’s agent had insisted that there was foul play, and Ribadu had followed up the argument with the suit now in view.
