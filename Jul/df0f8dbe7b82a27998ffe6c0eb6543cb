The All Progressives Congress, APC, in Rivers State has described the defection of some members of the party as “good riddance”. The state publicity secretary of the APC, Chris Finebone, made the comment on Monday following the recent exodus of members from the party. Finebone however acknowledged that some of the members who left added value to the party but wished them well as they resolved to leave the party. He further said the defection of some others comes as a relief for the party. According to Finebone “there have been some movement though I cannot term it exodus because that is relative. “What is important is that such a movement should be carefully appraised. The first individuals are those whom I can say added value to APC business while they were here, to them we wish them well. “However there are also the few that have left much to our relief. These are persons leaving after a tortuous effort by them to kill the APC without success. They even caused us non-appearance on the ballot in 2019. “To the exit of these particular persons, we say good riddance because they caused the party much more harm than good. “Happily some of them are having a second taught and taking advantage of the reconciliation process within the party to retrace their steps” The APC has witnessed the resignation of some members in recent times including former commissioners and House of Representatives members.
