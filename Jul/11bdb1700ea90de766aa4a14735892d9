Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar said he’s happy to have Governor Ifeanyi Okowa as his running mate for the 2023 election. The former vice president made the comment at the weekend in reaction to a special address by the governor. In a 3-minute video, Okowa said being on the ticket with Atiku gives him the opportunity to play a role in resetting the trajectory of Nigeria towards growth, peace and prosperity. “There is probably no time in the history of our country that the demand for good leadership is more compelling than the times that we are living in. “Our land continues to dig deep in the throes of disunity and our economy keeps breaking away from the reach of everyday hardworking Nigeria. “The scale of insecurity and the toll it takes on the peace of this country requires that we all roll up our sleeves to fight for peace to return to Nigeria”, he noted. Okowa appealed to PDP members and all “well-meaning” citizens to join hands to ensure the defeat of the All Progressives Congress (APC). In response, Atiku stated that getting Africa’s most populous nation back on track will require all hands on deck. “And I am excited to go on this journey with my Vice Presidential candidate, H.E Dr Ifeanyi Arthur Okowa. “Let’s come together as ONE towards a brighter future for all and for Nigeria”, he tweeted. In June, Atiku announced the Delta helmsman as the candidate for the VP slot, a choice some governors and party leaders are not comfortable with. Benue Governor Samuel Ortom; former Ekiti and Plateau governors, Ayo Fayose and Jonah Jang, among others have spoken in favour of Governor Nyseom Wike. Wike lost to Atiku at the PDP presidential primary which took place on May 28 in Abuja. The Rivers chief executive just returned to the state after a vacation in Turkiye (Turkey). Wike travelled alongside Abia Okezie Ikpeazu and was later joined by Oyo Governor Seyi Makinde.
