Adebayo Adewole, the presidential candidate of the Social Democratic Party, SDP, has said that Nigerian politicians have no business in government but are only after the country’s treasury. Addressing members of the National Association of Nigerian Students, NANS, in Abuja on Wednesday, the presidential candidate vowed to change the educational system if elected into power come 2023. Speaking further, Adebayo said that those in government today do not care about the public institutions but are in government basically to steal money. He further blamed both President Muhammadu Buhari and the students association for the lingering strike by Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU. “The Problem of Nigeria is the Government while the problem of the Government is the people,” he said. “It is an indictment on the government that ASUU is on strike for five months, it is also an indictment on the students that they can take it for this long. If you deny politicians Four Hours of their rights, they will do the needful. “It is only yesterday President Muhammadu Buhari held a proper meeting on the matter and gave himself 14-days ultimatum after wasting Five Months of students academic time”, he stated. “Buhari has not been in power for one day. He was just packaged and kept there by those who wanted power. Because those who want power are not those running for president “You must vote those who has no business stealing money meant for education “I will remove TETFund from government board of trustees and employ capable hands to run and manage the fund “There’s no government in Nigeria. People in government offices are people who have no business being in government. Had it been they could have access to CBN directly to steal directly, they won’t bother going into government “There’s no government in this country. What we have are politicians who share offices among themselves as compensation.”
