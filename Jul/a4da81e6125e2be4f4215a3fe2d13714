Inter Milan defender, Stefan de Vrij is set for a shock move to Manchester United this summer. According to Corriere dello Sport via Sport Witness, Manchester United are interested in De Vrij. Man United manager, Erik ten Hag, wants to bring in a ball-playing centre-back ahead of the new season and the Dutch star has emerged as a target for the Premier League giant. The Red Devils, though, are yet to make a move for the 30-year-old. With Inter ready to sanction a deal, the ball is in Man United’s court. De Vrij has been a pillar at the back for Inter Milan recently. His contract is set to run out next summer and Inter Milan are open to cashing in on him this year.
