The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu has claimed the party’s loss in the just-concluded Osun governorship election is a divine test from Almighty Allah. Adamu stated this during an interview with the BBC Hausa Service on Tuesday. According to him, the APC will now return to the drawing board “and change our tactics”. “This has shown that we have a big task ahead. We must see what we can do and change our tactics. “We must look at ourselves, see if what we are doing in this political journey is right. “What are those things that are not right? What needs to be corrected so that we get what will lead to success in our journey?” He said. Adamu added: “In politics like in other worldly affairs, one could win or lose. There’s nothing we can do. “But we were defeated not because we are not good in politics, it was because of what happened between some party members close to the election.”
