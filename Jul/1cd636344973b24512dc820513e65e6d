Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel has criticised his team’s performance against Charlotte. According to him, their performance was ‘not good enough’, adding that they lacked ‘precision’ and ‘decision making’. The Blues were defeated in their second game of their tour of the US, losing 5-3 on penalties to Charlotte. Conor Gallagher missed a decisive spot kick to condemn the Premier League side to their first preseason defeat. Daniel Rios’s injury time penalty cancelled out Christian Pulisic’s opener for Chelsea to make the game 1-1 after 90 minutes. And the German boss was left underwhelmed with his team’s output in the ‘last 20 meters of the pitch’, also lamenting the lack of hunger and effort shown from his side. “In general, I would say we played a good first half but unfortunately, only 80 metres of the pitch,” Tuchel said. “The last 20 metres of the pitch were not good enough, even in the first half. We found a lot of spaces to accelerate and penetrate the box but we struggled with our decision-making and precision in the last 20 metres. “This was simply not good enough for the effort and quality we showed in the first 80 metres of the pitch and the amount of space we had. “We also have to say we allowed two big chances out of nothing in the first half, otherwise I think we played a very good match in all the other aspects. “Second half, it took us half an hour to show some quality and then it was maybe for ten minutes, so it was not good at all. “Not offensively, not structure-wise, not in effort, hunger to be the dominant team. It was not good enough,” he said.
