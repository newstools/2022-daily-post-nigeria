Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, says the only way Nigeria can change is when old politicians are removed from office. Obi said this during the party’s mega rally on Wednesday in Osogbo. The presidential candidate said that it is only a vote for Alhaji Lasun Yusuf that could rescue the people of the state from suffering and poverty. “We want to change Nigeria and the only way we can change this nation is to remove all these people who have put Nigeria where it is for the past 23 years. This is the time for them to go.” Obi noted that if the party wins the governorship election on Saturday, their children will have jobs and also prompt payment of worker’ pension and salaries. “Vote for Labour party so that your children can have jobs. Vote for people that will work for you. “Vote for Labour party, vote for the future of your children. Vote for the candidate that will be committed to a better Osun state,” Obi said.
