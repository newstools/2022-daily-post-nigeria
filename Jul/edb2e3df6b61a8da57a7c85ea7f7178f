The Trade Union Congress of Nigeria (TUC) has asked the Nigerian Government to generally review salary and retirement age of core civil servants in the country. The TUC President, Quadri Olaleye made the call at the 12th Triennial National Delegates Conference on Tuesday in Abuja. Olaleye said that the salary review was necessary to narrow the gap between civil servants’ emoluments and those in other segments of the public service. According to him, the Federal Government during the negotiation on the last new National Minimum Wage promised to review the salary scheme, but had failed. “We are calling on the Federal Government to direct the Office of the Head of Service of the Federation to step action in that regards,” he said.
