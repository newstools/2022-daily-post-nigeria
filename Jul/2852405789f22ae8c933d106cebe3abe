Former Tottenham star, Danny Murphy has told Manchester United to only allow Cristiano Ronaldo out of Old Trafford on conditions that they have signed his replacement. The former England star said Cristiano Ronaldo’s departure could be a blessing in disguise if well managed. Asked if he thinks Ronaldo will play for the Red Devils again, Murphy told talkSPORT, “What my key question is about who they bring in instead of him. “If they let him go without replacing him, which would be ridiculous, then obviously they can’t let him go if they’ve got nobody in mind who can come in and score a decent amount of goals.” He said the Red Devils must get someone who is experienced enough and good enough to lead United’s attack. Ronaldo has already alerted the Red Devils of his desire to leave Old Trafford this summer and will be working tirelessly to try and secure a move away this summer The Portuguese 24 goals last summer could not help the Old Trafford landlords qualify for the Champions League and the 37-year-old would not play for a club outside the competition. “I wouldn’t be letting Ronaldo go until you get someone through the door,” Murphy insists, adding that “Ultimately, I think it’s a blessing in disguise.”
