As the 2023 general elections approach, a former Nigerian Senator, Dino Melaye has warned against attacks on the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. Dino, in a video posted on Sunday on his social media handles, said those in Atiku’s camp will no longer be silent on people ridiculing the personality of the former Vice President. According to him, the attacks are distractions as the opposition party is working towards rescuing the nation from its current state. He said, “While we are advocating for support from all Nigerians, we want to also warn seriously that we will not tolerate disparaging, ridiculing diminishing or using foul languages on Atiku Abubakar. “You come for Atiku, we will come for you. We will no longer keep quiet to characters who just want to use propaganda and lies to disparage and disrespect the person and personality of Atiku Abubakar. “The only business we have now is to rescue our country and it is not the business of PDP members alone but the business of every Nigerian.”
