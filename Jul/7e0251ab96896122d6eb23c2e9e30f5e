You’re running a system that you don’t even believe in. “Show me one Oyibo leader whose child is schooling in Nigeria. e no dey touch una? “And when you return, Nigerian youths will still gather and sing praises for una.” However, Following Musa’s post, Edochie took to his Twitter page to quote the football star and seemingly criticize him for not crediting the original source of the post.
