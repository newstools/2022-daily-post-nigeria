Chairman House of Representatives Committee on Internal Security, Danjuma Usman Shiddi has debunked allegations of his involvement in arms dealing. News trending on some online platforms, alleges that one of his campaign vehicles loaded with arms and ammunition was intercepted by security operatives in Ibi local government. The news claimed a soldier and two civilians who accompanied the vehicle were arrested. Debunking the allegation on Sunday via a press statement, the lawmaker who is presently representing Wukari/Ibi Federal Constituency, described the allegations as false. He said the allegations were an attempt to smear his image and bar him from moving ahead to actualize his political ambition of becoming the next senator of Taraba south in 2023. “It is the handiwork of those who hate me, I am not unaware that if they have their way, they would have singled me out of the Senate race in Southern Taraba to satisfy certain vested interests.” He said, “their hatred has reached a boiling point to have resorted to concocting such lame and cheap lies to bring me the to odium and public ridicule.” “Instead of licking their wounds privately and gently having realized my teeming supporters and I are coasting home triumphantly in the best interests of our people, sadly, they took their anger and frustration this far to tarnish my personal and public image.” Describing their actions as a “falling pack of cards” he vowed not to “either by actions or inactions destroy the good works I am toiling day and night to build.” The lawmaker called on the entire people of the zone especially his supporters to remain calm and vowed not to be dissuaded from heralding the much-desired dividends of democracy to the doorsteps of his constituency.
