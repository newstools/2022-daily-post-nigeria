Former Nigeria Minister for Transportation, Rotimi Ameachi, says he is back to Rivers State to ensure the victory of the All Progressives Congress in the 2023 general elections. Amaechi made the declaration shortly after arriving at the Port Harcourt International Airport, Omagwa on Saturday. He was received at the airport by leaders of the APC and his supporters amid fanfare. The former minister assured that he will address all the internal wranglings in the party that trailed his loss at the APC presidential primaries last month. He, therefore, called on members of the party to join him in achieving the objective. Speaking on litigations against the party over the conduct of its primaries in the state, Amaechi described the litigants as mischief makers who want to cause a repeat of the 2019 experience of the party in the state. He, however, assured that the APC will be on the ballot next year. He said “All those who are afraid of the election and want to go to court to remove people’s name from the ballot, I thought they are popular? “We will test our popularity in the election. Trust the court, justice will be done. Don’t be afraid, go home and work. “Our job is work. That’s why I came.” Amaechi recently came second at the APC presidential primaries last month after scoring 316 delegate votes.
