The leader INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele has said the Igbos should take advantage of 2023 and produce a Nigerian president of South-East extraction. Primate Ayodele said the future generations of the Igbos would suffer if they fail to produce Nigeria’s President in 2023. He, however, reiterated that Labour Party, LP, presidential candidate, Peter Obi can’t win in 2023. Speaking with journalists in his church yesterday, Ayodele said 2023 is not the turn of Yoruba race, but that of the Igbos. According to Ayodele: “2023 is the turn of the Igbos not even Yoruba, and if they miss it now, their great-grandchildren will be angry with them. Peter Obi can only make effort but won’t win.” The clergyman also pointed out that the candidate who could have won the presidency for Igbos was not given the ticket. This not withstanding, Ayodele urged Igbos to realign ahead of 2027 if they miss it in 2023. “The person who could have won the 2023 presidential election for the Igbos was not given the ticket, so the Igbos should go back and realign ahead of 2027. “I support Yoruba’s agenda but it’s not their turn, 2023 is the turn of the Igbos, and if they miss it now, their next generation will suffer for it.” He further cautioned Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State against dumping the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. The clergyman warned that Wike’s political career would be over if he dumps PDP for the All Progressives Congress, APC. “Wike leaving PDP to APC is the end of his political career. When we warned Umahi and Ayade they felt we were making noise, now they know. Wike should not take the wrong step. “APC and PDP are no longer good for Nigeria, they are not a glorious party that will take Nigeria to the next level even with their Chairmen. They picked the wrong people as Chairmen,” he added.
