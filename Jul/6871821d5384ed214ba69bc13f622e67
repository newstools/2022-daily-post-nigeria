The Majority Leader of the Adamawa State House of Assembly, Hammantukur Yettusuri, has defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). Yettusuri is the assembly member representing Jada/Mbulo, the home constituency of PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. Yettusuri officially joined the NNPP on Tuesday during a ceremony in the state capital, Yola, and was initiated into his new party with the trademark cap of the Kwankwasiyya Movement. Addressing newsmen on the side of his initiation into the Movement formed by the NNPP Leader, Rabiu Kwankwaso, Hammantukur Yettusuri said he was driven by a quest for justice. “I’m in the NNPP to join forces with other good Nigerians to fix the system. You see, if a system continues with imposition ideology, the eventual results become implosion. “As for me and my numerous supporters, we will commence activities immediately to ensure NNPP’s victory in the 2023 general elections,” he said. As part of his acceptance into the NNPP at the reception for him Tuesday afternoon, Yettusuri was handed the party’s automatic ticket for the Jada/Toungo/Ganye/Mayo Belwa federal constituency. DAILY POST reports that Yettusuri was a House of Representatives aspirant for the same federal constituency under the PDP but he lost the primary, evidently the real reason for his defection to the NNPP.
