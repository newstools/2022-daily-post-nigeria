A former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Adams Oshiomhole, has backed the party’s Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket. Oshiomhole said the APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu made the right decision by picking Borno Senator, Kashim Shettima as his running mate. Appearing on TVC on Thursday, Oshiomhole said Nigerians have struggled to balance the issue of religion in the past. He noted that Tinubu’s choice of Shettima showed that he would take bold steps if elected President in 2023. Oshiomhole said: “The more opposition party joined the Muslim-Muslim debate, the more I’m satisfied that Asiwaju Bola Tinubu’s decision is right. “We need courage. We have struggled to balance these religious issues in recent years. Tinubu’s decision shows that he will take bold steps when elected. “If the number of churches and mosques we have built over the years is equal to the number of factories, we won’t be at this poverty level in the country. “We can’t continue with business as usual. I’m satisfied with the quality of Shettima. He is well-read and well-exposed. He is well awarded both at home and abroad. “We should spend time interrogating the personality, and competence of Tinubu’s nominee. Soon, pagans will organise themselves to say otherwise too.”
