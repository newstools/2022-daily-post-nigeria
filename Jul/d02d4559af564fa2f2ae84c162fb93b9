Raphinha has expressed his delight at joining Barcelona from Leeds United. The Brazil international joined the Blaugurana in a €68m deal on Wednesday. According to Raphinha, it has been his dream and that of his family and friends from when he was young. He said: “For me it’s a dream, not just mine but my family and friends. “Whoever saw me play, knows that to get here is a dream that I’ve had since I was young. Now what I have to do is give my best and help Barça to return to being the Barça they always were.” Raphinha also admitted he’s following in his Brazilian idols’ footsteps by coming to Barcelona. “I saw Ronaldinho and Neymar play here. I am one more Brazilian who is arriving at Barça and I hope to achieve what they achieved there,” the 25-year-old added.
