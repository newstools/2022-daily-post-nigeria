Former Everton striker, Landon Donovan, has claimed that Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo and Paris Saint-Germain’s Lionel Messi will play in the Major League Soccer (MLS) in the near future. Major League Soccer began play in 1996. A lot of big names have played in the league in the past, such as Didier Drogba, Steven Gerrard, Andrea Pirlo, Frank Lampard, David Villa, and Ricardo Kaka. The league recently saw the arrival of two prominent names this summer, with Gareth Bale and Giorgio Chiellini joining Los Angeles FC. However, Donovan, who has scored 146 goals and registered 110 assists in 340 MLS appearances, said via Calciomercato: “Beckham led the way: now our league is growing very fast and everyone wants to come here. “I think one day Messi and Cristiano will play here too.” Donovan’s claim might hold more weight than some would want to believe. However, there is every possibility that both Ronaldo and Messi will find themselves playing in the MLS in the future.
