Ekiti State Governor-elect, Mr Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji, on Saturday, met two other prominent Ekiti sons in furtherance of his ongoing consultations with Ekiti elites at home and in the Diaspora in charting a new course for the state. The two people are; a former Minister of Health, Prince Julius Adelusi-Adeluyi; and Lagos Commissioner of Police, Abiodun Alabi. He met the duo in Lagos. Adelusi-Adeluyi is a prince of Ado Ekiti while Alabi hails from Ilawe Ekiti, in Ekiti South West. Oyebanji, who met the two Ekiti prominent sons at Prince Adelusi- Adelusi-Adeluyi’s Ikeja GRA residence, said the meeting was fruitful and targeted at harnessing professionals and experts from Ekiti extraction to contribute their quota to the development of the state. “The two Ekiti sons are trailblazers who have contributed in no small measure to national development. For instance, Prince Adelusi-Adeluyi, a top corporate player, is the first and perhaps the only Pharmacist to have served as Minister of Health in Nigeria. He is also the Chairman of Juli Plc, the first indigenously promoted company quoted on the Nigerian Stock Exchange, among other achievements. “Mr. Alabi, the Commissioner of Police, Lagos Command, is a career police officer, with a track record of excellence. Before he was transferred to Lagos where he’s currently redefining policing to enhance good security, he had recorded brilliant feats in various states. At this crucial time of Ekiti development, we need their experiences and those of others to deepen governance,” Oyebanji stated. Oyebanji said the ongoing consultation with Ekiti stakeholders and leaders within and outside the state would continue till his inauguration in October, adding that regular consultation with stakeholders will be a major feature of his administration’s public policy.
