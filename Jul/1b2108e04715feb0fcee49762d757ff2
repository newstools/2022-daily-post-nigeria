President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday stated that some office holders divert public funds. The Nigerian leader also vowed to make life bearable for the citizens. Buhari gave the assurance his Eid-el Kabir message, urging the people to live humbly. The President said if everyone puts the teachings of their religions into practice, the evils afflicting the country would have been solved. He noted that religion shouldn’t just be used as a mere badge of identity, but as a motivator for doing good. “The stealing of public funds by civil servants and other holders of public trust is a reflection of the abandonment of the teachings of our religions.” “People display external religiosity without fear of God; they make life difficult for others; money becomes their god. “Leaders abandon their oaths of office by taking money meant for the welfare of the people and divert it to their private pockets”, he said. The President congratulated Muslim faithful in Nigeria and across the world. He advised them to promote the good virtues of Islam through personal examples and practice. “Muslims should avoid association with violent extremist ideas that have wrongly given Islam a negative image or poor perception”, he added. On insecurity and cost of living, Buhari promised : “I won’t rest until I bring relief to Nigerians.” He assured that the government was aware of the difficulties people are facing and working to resolve them.
