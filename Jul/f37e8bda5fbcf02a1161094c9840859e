A professor of political science from Usmanu Dan fodio University Sokoto, Professor Ibrahim Bande Zagga, has criticised President Muhammadu Buhari over the prolonged strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU. He said from all indications, Buhari is not cut out to resolve the long standing agreements with university unions. Prof. Zagga reacted to the ongoing strike in Birnin Kebbi, where he noted that ASUU was also culpable in the plot to destroy public education as a whole going by the foot dragging approach by both parties. “How much does ASUU require to end the strike? It is a very simple committee comprising the union and the federal government, which have met and reports submitted to the federal government. It is just for the government to implement it, period, “he said. He lamented that the five months old strike has kept the students at home and their lecturers whom he said do not only teach but do other things like community works and others to keep the universities going. In another development, he said arguments over the same faith ticket is baseless and but a promotion of selfish interest by some group of politicians who want to use it as bait for confusion otherwise late Abiola did it in 1993 and he won, but died and very recently Osun with large number of Muslims voted same faith ticket. “So, it is not about religion but a patriotic leader who can bail out the country muslim- muslim or Christian it does not matter.”
