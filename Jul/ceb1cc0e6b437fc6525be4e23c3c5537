Some Chieftains of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Adamawa State, have accused former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Babachir Lawal, of having a hand in the APC Muslim-Muslim ticket stance. Politician, Faith Pukuma in her opinion faulted Babachir Lawal’s anti-Muslim-Muslim ticket stance claiming he could not exonerate himself from the birth of the party’s ticket. Faith who hails from the same Hong Local Government Area former SGF, alleged that he never disagreed with the party’s presidential candidate, saying he supported Tinubu against a Christian like Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and should bear whatever Tinubu chooses to do now. Babachir had, in a message on the pairing of Tinubu with Senator Kashim Shettima for the APC presidential ticket, criticised Tinubu over choosing a fellow Muslim as his running mate. But Faith said the lamentation of Babachir amounts to crocodile tears because he is aware that his friend Tinubu will not settle for what he does not believe will make him win the 2023 election. She said if Babachir and fellow kinsman, Senator Ishaku Abbo (who has also criticised APC’s same-faith pairing) were smart enough, they would have compelled Tinubu to agree over the choice of a running mate, “but they ended up being used and dumped.” Also, a close associate of Tinubu, Senator Abu Ibrahim, carpeted Babachir for publicly denouncing the Muslim-Muslim ticket adopted by the APC. In a chat with BBC Hausa, Ibrahim said Babachir was part of the process that selected the North East as the zone to produce the running mate. Ibrahim said the issue of religion was extensively discussed during the meeting which decided that they should settle on a person who will boost the party’s electoral fortunes. “Babachir was part of the process. He ought to have sensitized the Christian community about the considerations that led to the emergence of Kashim instead of inflaming sectarian passion,” Ibrahim said.
