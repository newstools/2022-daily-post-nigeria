Gunmen suspected to be bandits, on Sunday morning at 1:00 am, stormed a community, Lema in Mando-Kaduna and kidnapped eight people, including a pregnant woman, and her sick mother. Lema community is directly opposite the Nigeria Defence Academy (NDA) in Igabi Local Government Area, Kaduna State. A resident in the area, Mallam Ali Hoto, said when the bandits stormed the area, they began to shoot sporadically, creating fear in them, which made it possible for them to come out. He said the bandits have been terrorising them. He called on the state government to come to their rescue. The Kaduna State Police Command Public Relations Officer, DSP Mohammed Jalige, did not pick up his call for confirmation
