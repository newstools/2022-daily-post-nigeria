President Muhammadu Buhari has thanked Lisbon city in Portugal for assisting victims of the Russia-Ukraine war. The Nigerian leader met with Fernando Medina, Mayor of Lisbon and City Council Members on Friday. He expressed gratitude to them for accommodating Nigerians and other nationals fleeing Ukraine. The President also congratulated Medina and his party on their electoral victory. Buhari said Lisbon shares a number of similarities with some Nigerian cities such as Lagos, the former capital. He recalled that Lagos was named Lago de Curamo (Lake of Curamo) by Portuguese explorer Rui de Sequeira during his visit in 1472. Buhari said Nigeria, like Portugal, has many unique, historic, and cultural assets, as well as a developing hospitality industry, which both countries can exploit. “We are also keen to establish a direct air link between our two countries to further stimulate tourism, people-to-people contact and social, sporting and cultural relations”, he noted. The President invited prospective investors to Nigeria as the next top investment destination. “We are ready to extend our bilateral trade beyond oil and gas”, he added.
