Explaining the decision to sign Erikson, Man United’s Football Director, John Murtough, said the 30-year-old will add valuable experience and leadership to manager Erik ten Hag’s squad. Murtough told the club’s official website: “Christian has been one of the best-attacking midfielders in Europe throughout his career. It is no surprise that he had so many options this summer, so we are really happy that he was convinced that this is the right club for him. “In addition to his outstanding technique, Christian will add valuable experience and leadership skills to the squad, and we are looking forward to seeing the benefits of these qualities on the pitch this coming season and beyond.”
