Some gunmen have abducted a farm supervisor on the farm of a former Governor of Oyo State, late Adebayo Alao-Akala. Alao-Akala, who was an indigene of Ogbomoso, ruled the state as governor between 2007 and 2011. The farm worker, who hails from Gbongan in Ayedaade Local Government Area in Osun State, was kidnapped on the farm named TDB farms located in Jabata in Surulere Local Government Area in Oyo State. DAILY POST gathered on Tuesday that the worker, Christopher Bakare was kidnapped around 7 pm on Saturday by gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen. The kidnappers are also demanding the sum of N100m as ransom. A close source to the Alao-Akala family and an indigene of Ogbomoso, confirmed the abduction to DAILY POST on Tuesday. He said that the matter has been reported to the police. “We have been trying to negotiate with them even though the police had been informed”. Another source added that Police Area Command in Ogbomoso, has been informed about the incident. But, all efforts made by DAILY POST to get a reaction from the Public Relations Officer of the state police command, Adewale Osifeso proved to be abortive as calls put through his mobile number were not successful while an SMS sent to him has not been replied as at the time of filing this report.
