Manchester United have moved ahead of Arsenal in the race to sign Ajax defender, Lisandro Martinez. The defender is set for a shock move to Manchester United this summer. Man United are now in pole position to sign Martinez ahead of Arsenal. The report added that Martinez is keen on a reunion with Erik ten Hag, who coached him during their time together at Ajax. Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, had identified the 24-year-old as the ideal candidate to offer competition for Gabriel Magalhaes on the left side of Arsenal’s central defence. Arsenal transfer chief Edu had submitted three bids for the Argentina international, but the Gunners are yet to agree on a fee. That indecision has allowed Man United an opportunity to steal a march on the Gunners, according to the Manchester Evening News. The Red Devils have made a £37million offer for Martinez as they continue to pursue targets familiar to Ten Hag.
