Leeds United legend, Jermaine Beckford, has suggested to Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel the best position to play Kai Havertz in the Blues squad. Beckford believes Tuchel was using Havertz in the wrong position for large spells of last season. According to him, the best position for Tuchel to play the Germany international is the No.10 role. Havertz, who has spent two seasons at Chelsea, is a versatile attacker that divides opinion. He was deployed in a false nine position in the second half of the season by Tuchel, particularly when Romelu Lukaku was struggling for minutes and confidence on the pitch. Havertz ended up with 14 goals and six assists across all competitions for Tuchel’s side last season. “With Kai Havertz, I am a huge admirer of his. I don’t think he is built to be a number nine. That is not his natural position,” Beckford told talkSPORT. “That is not where we see the best of him. He works better when he’s working alongside somebody or as a number 10.”
