The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Saturday, mocked the Presidential Candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu for allegedly rushing to Abuja in the face of the defeat of his party, in Osun State Governorship election. A statement by the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Hon. Debo Ologunagba said Tinubu’s action cannot overturn the will of the people at the polls. According to the statement, the opposition party is already aware that APC leaders are rushing to Abuja in a “desperate move to manipulate the process and frustrate the smooth conclusion of the election, having realized that the APC has been rejected by the people. “Asiwaju Tinubu must know that the people of Osun State have spoken and that his running to Abuja cannot save the deflated Governor Gboyega Oyetola from the reverberating verdict of the ballot box.” There are speculations that the PDP candidate, Ademola Adeleke is leading in several polling units across the State. However, Tinubu was reported to have rushed to the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, for an important meeting with some party stakeholders.
