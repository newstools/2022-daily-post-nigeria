The camp of the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar, has reacted to recent meetings between Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State and presidential candidates of other political parties. Obi, who is the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) had visited Wike in Port Harcourt a few days after the Rivers State Governor failed in the bid to grab the main opposition party’s presidential ticket. While details of the meeting remain sketchy, the former Anambra State Governor, hours later, took to his official Twitter handle to say that he met with Wike to discuss vital national issues. After Obi’s visit, the presidential candidate of the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP), Rabiu Kwankwaso, followed suit. Then on Thursday, Joe Igbokwe, a chieftain of the APC in Lagos State, informed Nigerians that Wike and Bola Tinubu met in France. And reacting to the development, Segun Sowunmi, Spokesman, Atiku Presidential Campaign, said, “I have never doubted that we have a phenomenon in the person of Governor Nyesom Wike. He is our asset, our party man through and through. “Therefore, when some of those that have graduated from our school of politics like Peter Obi run to him, it makes me smile. “When you hear that the APC presidential candidate, [Bola Tinubu] wants to meet him in France, you know what I remember? “I remember my indefatigable leader, Nyesom Wike, when he said, ‘I’ll never leave a place that is suffering from malaria and run to a place that is suffering from cancer.’ “I suppose you are really truly believing that, in your wistfulness, PDP will implode. It’s not going to happen.”
