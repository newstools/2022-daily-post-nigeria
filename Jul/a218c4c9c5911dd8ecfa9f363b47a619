Nollywood actress, Funke Akindele, popularly known as Jenifa, has confirmed her nomination as the deputy gubernatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Akindele, in a video posted on Tuesday via her Instagram page, disclosed that she would be putting a hold on her career as an actress and will venture into politics to cause a change to improve the welfare of Lagosians. She asked that youths rally around her and governorship candidate, Dr Olajide Adediran known as Jendor to achieve a better Lagos “I am a Lagosian born out of Ikorodu so when the PDP gubernatorial candidate asked me to be his deputy governor I saw it as an opportunity to help liberate and improve the welfare of our people, particularly the deprived youth, women, and girl child. “My decision is not only to accept this huge responsibility to see our dear Lagos live up to its full potential with the people as its immediate beneficiaries. “Over the years a lot of youths have been ignored victimised for daring to have a dream so I use this opportunity to call out all well-meaning residents of the nation, especially the youths. It’s indeed time to use our numerical strength to our full advantage and time to rally ourselves and support our own. “I’m not unaware of the cost of this assignment on my vibrant career which I must now necessarily put on hold its a huge personal sacrifice but my resolve is no sacrifice is too much for the actualisation of the urgent mission to rescue our people and dear state. “It is a call I take with reverence and utmost sense of responsibility. Indeed we can achieve a Lagos for all our residents.”   A post shared by Funke Akindele Bello (@funkejenifaakindele)
