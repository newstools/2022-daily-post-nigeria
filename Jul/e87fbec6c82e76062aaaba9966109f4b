The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has denied reports making the rounds that he asked Christians to buy guns for self-protection. The renowned cleric made this known during the church’s monthly thanksgiving. The clarification came against reports that he said it was now “fire-for-fire’’ for any attack on Christians. “I never asked Christians to go and buy guns. Samson in the Bible did not fight with guns,’’ “Don’t buy guns. You don’t want to kill anybody. We just must make sure that unwanted visitors don’t come to our churches, so don’t go and buy guns,’’ he said. Adeboye also urged members of the church not to be afraid to attend church programmes because of the terrorist attack on a church in Owo, Ondo State. Recall that over 40 worshippers were killed and many injured when terrorists attacked Saint Francis Catholic Church, Owo, on June 5 2022. The 80-year- old cleric urged Christians to rise to the occasion and call the bluff of the devil.
