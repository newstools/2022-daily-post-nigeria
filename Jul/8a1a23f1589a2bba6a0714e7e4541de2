Ibrahim Masari has announced his resignation as running mate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu in the forthcoming 2023 election. DAILY POST reports that Masari’s name was earlier submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC as placeholder while the party combed for a potential candidate. However, Masari in a letter addressed to members of the APC on Sunday, announced his resignation. The letter reads in part, “I had the singular honour and privilege of being nominated as the running mate to Asiwaju Tinubu last month after a keenly contested presidential primary ahead of the 2023 general election. “After much reflection and wider consultations, I now wish to step down. I realised that my decision will enable Asiwaju to have more latitude to give more accommodation and inclusion that will position our party to win the coming elections, with the support of the people of Nigeria.” DAILY POST had reported that Tinubu has picked Senator Kashim Shettima as his running mate.
