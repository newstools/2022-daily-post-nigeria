Former Manchester United captain, Bryan Robson has revealed the club’s fastest player under their new manager, Erik ten Hag. Robson, who has continued to maintain contact with Man United, said forward Anthony Elanga is currently the fastest player in the Red Devils squad. Speaking to MUTV (via Mirror), Robson said, “When I was speaking with Darren Fletcher, he said he’s [Anthony Elanga] probably the quickest at the club.” Robson went on to warn Elanga to ensure that he did not waste opportunities his pace would provide. He added, “He has to use that pace and make the right runs. “He has to get in the box and score goals. If you get four chances in a game, can you put two of them away?” Elanga was one of the few bright spots in a bleak season for Manchester United last campaign and has a bright future ahead of him in the game
