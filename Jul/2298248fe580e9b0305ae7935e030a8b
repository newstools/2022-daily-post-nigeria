The Zamfara State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) said it has received report of some of its erstwhile members who moved to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the State. According to a press statement signed by the State’s publicity secretary of the party, Comrade Yusuf Idris Gusau, the APC was not moved by their decision to defect. He said they failed to officially inform the party of their move which was not for any reason but self aggrandizement. “Their individual and collective loyalists have remained in the people-focused APC, thus it’s bewildering to hear them claim thousands of followers. “Just as they left the APC, we are happy that the ruling party has continued to receive and welcome more decampees in the State and keeping it ahead of other political parties,” he said.
