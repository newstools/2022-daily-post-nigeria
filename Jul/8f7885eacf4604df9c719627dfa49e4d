The Niger State Police Command has called on members of the public, particularly vehicle owners in the state using spy number plates either approved or otherwise to henceforth desist from using them. The command directed those using such number plates to return them to the nearest police station. This was contained in a statement signed by the state Police Public Relations Officer, PRO, DSP Wasiu Abiodun on behalf of the command in Minna. Abiodun said the decision was sequel to the total ban on the use of spy number plates by vehicle owners across the nation without an exception of either being authorized or not, as directed by the Inspector-General of Police, IGP Alkali Baba Usman. Consequently, the statement stated that the Commissioner of Police, Niger State Command, CP Monday Bala Kuryas has directed the Department of Operations, Area Commanders and DPOs in the state to commence the enforcement of this ban with immediate effect. Kuryas said the officers have been specifically directed to retrieve such number plates on any vehicle found violating the ban and forward such retrieved number plates to the Command Headquarters. The statement then urged Nigerlites, especially vehicle owners to cooperate with the Police and other security agencies in the enforcement of the ban aimed at strengthening the internal security arrangements towards ensuring a more secured environment.
