Some youth leaders in Ward 10, Calabar Municipal Council, Cross River State led by Mr Saviour Omini have alleged poor remuneration from the Peoples Democratic Party after working many years for the opposition party in the state. The youths made the remark on Sunday when many of them decamped to the ruling All Progressives Congress. They claimed that they never felt the impact of democratic benefits even though they were used by the PDP leaders. The youths said the need to join their colleagues who left the party for APC last year to work for its victory in Bacoco ward 10 Area of Calabar Municipality in 2023 has now become imperative. Omini said, “Politics is serious business and therefore working for a party for many years without any dividends needs a rethink that is why we had to join our brethren in APC since the party is the anchor of choice for many of our people and we are prepared to work for the victory of our party in all elections”. Speaking on behalf of others, Omini said there are some indications that APC will sweep Cross River in next year’s general elections. Receiving them, former Commissioner for Finance and Cross River Southern Senatorial candidate, Asuquo Ekpenyong jr said they have made the best decision by abandoning a party that does not care for their youths. Ekpenyong claimed that the APC has great plans for Calabar Municipality and Cross River State at large. He said they are the only political party to respect the principles of zoning both at the national and the state level and will record a clean sweep in the 2023 general elections. ” The APC is the only party that has done the right thing by respecting the principle of zoning not just in the state but at the national level as well, and because of this, I am certain the party will record a 100% success for all it’s candidates come 2023. “
