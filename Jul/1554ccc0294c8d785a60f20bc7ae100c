Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has said he was surprised by the club’s forward Timo Werner’s hint that he could leave Stamford Bridge in a bid to get more regular playing time. Earlier this week, Werner dropped a heavy hint that his future may lie away from the Blues, stating he could be happy elsewhere. The Germany international expressed his concerns over a lack of game time under Tuchel, insisting that the 2022 World Cup is coming. However, speaking on the development on Wednesday night, Tuchel expressed his dismay at those comments from Werner, adding that the player should be grateful for playing for Chelsea. He also told Werner to do his talking on the pitch rather than off it. “I’m surprised, I would be very happy as a young guy having a contract at Chelsea football club. I would be one of the happiest people on the planet,” Tuchel said at his post-match press conference after Chelsea’s friendly tie with Charlotte. “He needs to get his game time. He has to show quality, take your place and defend your place. “I would be one of the happiest people on the planet having a contract with Chelsea. If he said this, I do not understand.”
