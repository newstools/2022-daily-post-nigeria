The police command in Lagos State is set to go after Point of Sale (POS) operators who ply their trade near stations. Public Relations Officer, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, made the disclosure in a Twitter post. The police observed that those in the business specialize in hanging around police stations. Investigations found that customers are innocent Nigerians being extorted by some recalcitrant personnel. “Their presence around the stations has made the extortion game a lot easier”, the command complained. Nothing that the force continually purges itself of bad officers, the police said was high time POS operators were regulated. Hundeyin added that the action was “in line with the mandate of not just detecting but also preventing crime”. “To this end, anyone found to have knowingly enabled extortion will be treated as an accomplice”, the PRO said.
