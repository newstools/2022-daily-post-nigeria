All affiliate unions of the Nigeria Labour Congress in Ekiti State have agreed to participate in next week’s solidarity mass protest organized by the NLC. The protest is in solidarity with university lecturers, to salvage the education sector in the country. The various affiliate unions made their commitment known during a meeting held at the labour house in Ado Ekiti to deliberate on how to carry out the protest. Two of the affiliate unions, JNC Chairman, Mr Kayode Fatomiluyi and NULGE president, Mr Oluseyi Olatunde noted that they have directed all their members to come out enmasse to rescue the future of the younger generation. They explained that students of Nigeria Universities have overstayed at home, hence the need for government to hear the yearning of the lecturers by fulfilling the agreement made with them. Also, Ekiti State University SSANU, Chairman, Mr Temidayo Aguda and Vice Chairman ASUU, Mr Ayodeji Salami appreciated NLC for taking the bold step to join the academic staff to salvage University education from collapsing. Earlier, the NLC Chairman in Ekiti State, Mr Kolapo Olatunde said there was no going back on the proposed protest, saying the protest was in line with the constitution. Mr Olatunde called on all members of affiliate unions to converge on Fajuyi park for the rally by eight O’clock in the morning.
