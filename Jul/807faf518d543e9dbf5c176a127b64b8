The Federal Government says the British authority has taken care of its looted artefacts for so long and it is time for the cultural and historical works of art to return home. The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, stated this in London during a working visit to the British Museum. Speaking after a meeting with officials of the museum, Mohammed, who was taken round the gallery and strong room, thanked them for their passion and for taking care of the artefacts for so long. NAN reports the minister met with Sam Nixon, Curator, and Head of Africa Section, British Museum, and Lissan Bolton, Keeper of the Department of Africa, Oceania and the Americas in the Museum. “Before now, they said we did not make a demand, but in October last year, almost nine months ago we made a formal request for the return of the artefacts, especially the Benin bronzes for which we have not got any response. “We made them understand that our quest and clamour is for the return of the Benin bronzes and all other artefacts that were stolen and looted to their origin. “I said they should take a cue from Germany which was neither our coloniser nor the one that looted the artefacts but which has yielded to pressure and signed an agreement to return 1,130 Benin bronzes to us. “We also made it clear to them that they cannot hide under legislation and no Act of Parliament will make what you have stolen become yours,” he said
