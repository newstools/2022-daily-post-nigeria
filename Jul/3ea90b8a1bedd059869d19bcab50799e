The Bishop of Anglican Communion, Diocese of Calabar, Most. Rev Nneoyi Egbe has said that kidnappers who go after men of God and collect ransoms from them are unwittingly swindling God. He said the kidnappers were also attempting to impoverish the church. He said those attacking men of God were cursed. He spoke during an interview at his Church’s headquarters in Calabar. In the last three months, a good number of church leaders have been abducted and ransoms running into millions of Naira have been paid to secure their release. Egbe said, “it has been very regrettable that in recent times, abductors are preferring to go after Bishops and church leaders as a way of extorting huge sums of money from them. “Church vicars don’t have money. They are attempting to embarrass God, which they cannot. Their attacks on men of God will attract heavier punishment from God. “Don’t they know that they are swindling God? Since church leaders don’t have such ransom they demand it is the church members that, out of their sweats and savings, contribute, denying themselves, children and dependants welfare, to raise the ransoms they demand. “I tell you that they are cursed. Their generations are cursed. God will strike them for looting the church, directly swindling God.” As a way of checking kidnapping of clerics and insecurity generally, the church leader called on the Federal Government to strengthen security apparatus. He disagreed that with a minister that said the country was now well secured. “People are not able to travel across the country freely nor are they able to sleep in their houses with two eyes closed. People are still being kidnapped for outrageous ransoms, harassed and traumatized. “We need State police. Denying Nigerians this is evidence of government’s insincerity in securing the Nigerian environment against elements that are pursuing their evil agenda,” he added.
