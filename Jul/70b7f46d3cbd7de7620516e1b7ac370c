Chelsea are ready to offer defender Kalidou Koulibaly an annual salary of €9.5 million, according to La Repubblica via Caught Offside. Koulibaly has entered the final year of his contract with Napoli. The Senegalese international is not planning to extend his stay at Napoli and the Serie A giants are willing to cash in on him this year. Chelsea are eager to secure Koulibaly’s signature as they look to address the void left at the back by the departures of Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen. Chelsea will have to battle Juventus, who are also monitoring Koulibaly with interest but the Old Lady’s salary offer is €3 million less than the Blues’. As such, a move to Chelsea could be on the cards for the 31-year-old.
