Manchester United manager, Erik ten Hag, has warned Anthony Martial that his hopes of reviving his career at the club, depends on a demonstration of total commitment to his new manager’s rebuilding process. Martial arrived at United nearly seven years ago and has failed to deliver consistently under different managers. The France forward was loaned out to Sevilla in January but has now returned following an unimpressive six months in Spain, in which he netted only once in 12 appearances. Cristiano Ronaldo’s absence in pre-season has, however, afforded Martial an unlikely chance to make an instant impression on Ten Hag and the early signs have been encouraging. The 26-year-old scored a superb goal in Tuesday’s 4-0 thrashing of Liverpool and was on the scoresheet again as United cantered to another thumping win on Friday, a 4-1 win over Melbourne Victory. “I’m sure he will come back and even better I think when he has the right focus and right motivation and he works hard, then he will have production because he is a good player. “When he has the right focus every day and delivers the maximum he will have production and it’s up to him,” Ten Hag said.
