Former President, Olusegun Obasanjo, was behind the wheels of a tricycle (Keke) on Saturday. Obj, as fondly called, rode through some roads in Abeokuta, capital of Ogun, to pick passengers. The sight caught the attention of many who cheered the former Head of State and also took photos. The elder statesman, who offered rides to citizens, moved through Moshood Abiola, NNPC Mega Station, Kuto Market, among others. The activity was part of OBJ @ 85 Free Keke Programme of the Youth Development Centre of Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL).  In his remarks, Obasanjo appealed to the youths not to leave Nigeria to those messing it up. The ex-leader said despite the challenges, they should try to take advantage of available opportunities to make an impact. “Things are not what they should be but youths, individually and collectively, must make contributions in order to make things the way they should be. “If you leave things to those who are messing it up for you and who are saying you are the leaders of tomorrow, you will never have that tomorrow. “God has given you innate ability to be what He wants you to be. If you make up your mind, God will help you and provide people who would help you”, he added.
