Manchester City winger, Riyad Mahrez, has sent a warning to Liverpool and Chelsea over the Premier League title race for the upcoming new 2022-23 season. Mahrez warned Liverpool and Chelsea that Pep Guardiola’s side wants to win the Premier League title again, adding that they are built with a winning mentality. The Algerian international scored 11 goals and registered five assists as Man City won the Premier League title last season. Man City won the English top-flight league ahead of Liverpool and Chelsea last term. “We really, really want to win again,” the 31-year-old told the Daily Mail. “When the season starts, we want to go again. That’s a big motivation. We never ever think, ‘Oh, it’s going to be easy this year,’ or we can go a bit easy. “No, we go 100 per cent from the beginning because we want to win and we are built with this mentality.”
