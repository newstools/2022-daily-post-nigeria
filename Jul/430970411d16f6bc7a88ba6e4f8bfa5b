The African Democratic Congress (ADC) has claimed the support for the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Mr Peter Obi will wane before the February 2023 election. The party’s National Coordinator for electoral matters and INEC liaison, Mr Anayo Arinze stated this during a meeting of the stakeholders of the party in Awka, Anambra State capital. Arinze who formally unveiled the presidential candidate of the party, Mr Dumebi Kachikwu, said the party is confident of beating other parties in the election, including Peter Obi. He said: “We have resolved to deepen our presence in Anambra State. We have chosen Mr Dumebi Kachikwu as our presidential candidate and we are ready to go with him and ensure victory. “We are not bothered about the noise on social media about the candidate of the Labour Party, Mr Peter Obi. All that will die down before the 2023 election. “We have comfortably entrenched ourselves as the third force in Nigeria politics, and our structures are visible for all to see. Go to the wards, local government areas and states, you will see our offices everywhere. “Since I entered Anambra, I have been looking around to see if I can spot the offices of the Labour Party, but there is none. Tell them to go and build structures before they can come back to contest an election. “It is important for people to know that there is no election on the social media, what they are doing is paying social media influencers to make noise about them,” Arinze said. The party said it has long launched what it called polling units executives and that the executives would be in all the polling units, and each set of executives would be responsible for their victory in designated polling units. In their separate remarks, some candidates of the party, stating their motivating factor, expressed hope that the party would win in their constituencies convincingly.
