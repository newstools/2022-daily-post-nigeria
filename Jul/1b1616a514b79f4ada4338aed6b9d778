The APC 2023 Senatorial candidate for Benue South, Daniel Onjeh has felicitated the Muslim Ummah in Nigeria on the special occasion of Eid-El-Kabir. Onjeh urged the Muslim faithful to always be mindful of the significance of the occasion, which includes total faith in the Almighty Allah and a disposition to make costly sacrifices in obedience to God and for the advancement of mankind. He appealed to all Muslims to imbibe a more profound sense of piety, as well as love and generosity for all their neighbours, in line with the precepts of Allah as communicated through His Holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.) The APC candidate for Benue South equally ceased the occasion to charge all Muslims to pray fervently for peace in Nigeria and a definitive end to the security challenges currently bedevilling the nation. He also tasked the Muslim Ummah to pray for the success of leaders at all levels, and for the peaceful conduct of the 2023 General Elections. While noting that the Eid-El-Kabir celebration symbolizes the immense value that the Almighty Allah places on human life, hence His offer of a ram to Prophet Abraham for a sacrifice in place of his only son, Onjeh implored all the perpetrators of extrajudicial killings of their fellow humans under any guise and motive, to desist from their evil ways and offer prayers to God for forgiveness and mercy.
