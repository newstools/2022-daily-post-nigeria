Former Manchester City winger, Trevor Sinclair has expressed excitement over the impending arrival of Gianlucca Scamacca at West Ham. The Hammers are on the verge of announcing a deal for Gianlucca Scamacca from Sassuolo. He told talkSPORT: “Superb. “Big lad, young as well, only 23, so if he does do really well and is someone that wants to move clubs, you can make a profit from him as well. “Playing in Italy, it’s difficult to score goals there and he’s proved he’s capable. “It will be interesting to see how he settles in if we do get him over the line. “It’s a massive boost for the squad. (Michail) Antonio will be looking at thinking there are plenty of games to go round.”
