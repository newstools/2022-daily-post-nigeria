The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, has accused the Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo of trying to distort history. Keyamo had said the PDP presidential candidate was among the first Nigerians to abandon the June 23 struggle. He said Atiku, former President Olusegun Obasanjo and most of the current presidential candidates never played any role in the June 12 struggle. Keyamo pointed out that only Bola Tinubu, the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, played a pivotal role in the June 12 struggle. To this end, he said Tinubu should be allowed to rule Nigeria in 2023. Responding, Atiku dismissed Keyamo’s remark of him abandoning the June 12 struggle. His response was contained in a tweet by his Media Aide, Paul Ibe. Ibe tweeted: “2023: Atiku, June 12 And Keyamo’s Attempt To Rewrite History “The events of the June 12 crisis are too well documented for anyone to seek to distort it. Keyamo told a blatant lie when he said Atiku “abandon(ed) June 12″. Atiku never abandoned June 12.”
