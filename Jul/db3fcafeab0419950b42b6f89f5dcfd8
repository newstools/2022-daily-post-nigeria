Former Real Madrid star, Cicinho believes Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar might be better than Ballon d’Or winners, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Cicinho also said that the Brazilian international is as good as both Messi and Ronaldo. Messi and Ronaldo have been at the top of their games for over 15 years now. Both players have established themselves as the best two footballers of their generation, if not of all time. Many backed Neymar to follow in their footsteps when he joined Barcelona back in 2013 for €88 million. Neymar then moved to PSG four years later for a world-record fee of €222 million with a view to becoming the best player in the world. However, the move hasn’t gone according to plans for the 30-year-old so far. Injuries have blighted Neymar’s stay and he has missed a whopping 104 matches across five seasons at PSG. PSG are even said to be willing to listen to offers for Neymar this ongoing summer transfer window ahead of the 2022-2023 campaign. Despite Neymar’s prominence dwindling in recent years, Cicinho told Jovem Pan Esportes: “Neymar is as good as Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi, if not better.”
