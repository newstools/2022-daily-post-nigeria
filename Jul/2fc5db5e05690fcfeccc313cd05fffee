Former Leeds United striker, Noel Whelan, has urged Arsenal to re-sign Serge Gnabry from Bayern Munich this summer. Whelan said the Germany international would light up the Premier League should he join Arsenal. Gnabry came through the youth ranks of Arsenal before eventually moving back to his homeland. The 26-year-old winger is attracting interest from the Gunners amid his contract standoff at Bayern Munich. “I think with the fact that their top targets are now going elsewhere, this is probably the next exciting name on the list. It would be a smart move,” Whelan told Football Insider. “He’s got a year left, so it would be a good deal for a very good international player – and someone who has played at the very highest level.” He added: “I believe he would just further improve that attacking flair at Arsenal – even if they are already so strong in that final third. They need to replace certain players, and Gnabry is someone I think would light up the Premier League.”
