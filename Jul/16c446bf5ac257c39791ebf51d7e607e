Former England cricketer, Kevin Pietersen, has claimed that Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo belongs at Chelsea. According to Pietersen, the Blues have anything else but a player of Ronaldo’s pedigree. He tweeted: “Chelsea has a defence, Chelsea has a midfield, Chelsea has a wonderful manager, Chelsea is in London and that is where @Cristiano belongs… “Utd hasn’t got a defence, Utd hasn’t got a midfield, Utd have a manager no one has heard of and it’s Manchester… “Do the maths!” Chelsea are one of the clubs monitoring Ronaldo’s future at Old Trafford, after the 37-year-old made it clear he wants to play in the Champions League. Bayern Munich, Napoli and Barcelona are also keen on the Portugal superstar.
