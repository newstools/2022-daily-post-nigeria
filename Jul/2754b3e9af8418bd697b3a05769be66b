The Obalesu Obatala Agbaye, Olaolu Dada, has announced the readiness of traditionalists to use their powers to fight insecurity. Dada declared that the pan-Yoruba group Irorun Ile Kaaro-oo-jiire will explore its spiritual strength to protect citizens. The Yoruba priest spoke on Saturday at a news conference at Obatala temple in Igbotapa area of Ile-Ife, Osun State. Dada lamented that no day ends without reports of killing, kidnapping, banditry, armed robbery and others. “Enough is enough. It is high time we moved to address this security challenge bedeviling our country. “We are ready to use them to deliver ourselves and our people in Nigeria. “The powers used by our forefathers still remain with us”, NAN quoted him saying. Dada assured that the organization would collaborate with security agencies to tackle the lingering security problems. He said they were not interested in politics or Yoruba nation agitation, but determined to rise up without using “guns and cutlasses”.
