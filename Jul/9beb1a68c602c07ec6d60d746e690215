Adamawa local government chairmen of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have vowed to ensure the failure of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 general election. The chairmen who met in Yola, the state capital, on Sunday, said they would be tireless campaigners who would cause the voting out of all candidates of the ruling PDP, including presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar and Governor of the state, Ahmadu Fintiri. During the engagement meeting convened by an APC stalwart, Mallam Jamilu Yusuf, the party chairmen said they remain faithful as grassroots mobilizers and their support for the party will make Atiku Abubakar lose Adamawa despite his status as an indigene of the state. Jamilu, recalling that in 1999 Atiku brought Chief Olusegun Obasanjo to the people of Adamawa State and they voted for him, said it is Atiku’s turn to pay back in favour of APC presidential candidate, Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu. ”This time, we are bringing Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu as the most trusted politician and we want him (Atiku) to vote for our candidate,” Jamilu said. The APC chairmen for Adamawa’s 21 local government areas who spoke one after the other, also said the APC gubernatorial candidate, Senator Aishatu Ahmed Binani, will defeat incumbent Governor Ahmadu Fintiri. They spoke of how the PDP, jittery of failure against Binani, has made a female its deputy governorship candidate, adding, “We are confident that Binani will beat Fintiri hands down.” The APC Chairman for Girei LGA, Abubakar Audu who was the chairman of the meeting, stressed that the APC in Adamawa is equal to the task of beating Atiku Abubakar in his own state. Audu vowed to use his men as the party’s grassroots campaigners to engage people from door to door propagating the APC agenda of all candidates. “We are lovers of APC in full, we are not going back on our support,” he said.
