Former National Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and spokesman of Akwa Ibom Elders’ Forum, Senator Anietie Okon has said any attempt by the party or the presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar to ignore Gov Nyesom Wike will be disastrous. DAILY POST reports that the Rivers State Governor and his supporters are still angry over the outcome of the presidential primary. The situation got worse after Atiku picked Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa as his running mate against Wike who was recommended by the ad-hoc committee set up for that purpose. Meanwhile, there is move by governors of the All Progressives Congress, APC, to woo Wike to the party but the attempt has not yet yielded positive result. However, Senator Okon, who is a Chieftain of the PDP in Akwa Ibom State, in an interaction with journalists in Uyo, weekend, warned the PDP against ignoring Wike. He said that such would spell doom to the party as Wike had been a strong pillar in the party. He said, “The governor of Rivers, Nyesom Wike has been a strong participant of the party. He has done so much for the PDP and has remained a faithful party man. “So, thinking of ignoring him is like taking a killer decision, not after a committee set up by the party voted strongly for him. This is very important, every other consideration is immaterial. “Therefore, I will advise Alh. Atiku Abubakar, the PDP presidential candidate whom I have congratulated, to do everything possible to handle the situation amicably for the 2023 presidential election.”
