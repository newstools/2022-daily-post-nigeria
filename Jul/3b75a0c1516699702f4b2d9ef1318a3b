Chelsea are ‘very close’ to signing Presnel Kimpembe from Paris Saint-Germain as their third signing of the summer, according to Portuguese outlet O Jogo. Kimpembe would become Chelsea’s second defensive recruit after Kalidou Koulibaly, while Raheem Sterling has also joined the Blues. Chelsea are now in talks with PSG over a deal for Kimpembe and it’s understood that the French Ligue 1 champions are willing to sell the centre-back. The reports added that PSG are now looking at Sporting’s Goncalo Inacio as Kimpembe’s replacement. However, PSG are holding out for a €50m (£42.3m) fee for the France international. Kimpembe has been linked with a move away from PSG this summer. The 26-year-old has drawn the interest of Chelsea and Juventus in the past.
