The African Youth Assembly has condemned the killing of 23 Africans at the Moroccan-Spain border. It made the condemnation through the Speaker of the Assembly in the West African Region, Comrade Matthew Naankin, in Jos, the Plateau State capital. DAILY POST recalls that the people were killed on June 24th, while attempting to cross the Melilla chain link fence. He decried that the act contravenes the international convention on the protection of the right of migrants and workers across the region. ”The leadership of the African Youth Assembly with its continental secretariat in Mombasa, Kenya, through its West African Regional Speaker from Nigeria, condemns the gruesome killing of 23 people at the Moroccan-Spain border. ”This occurred when some Africans attempted crossing the Melilla chain-link fence. ”We wish to state categorically clear that the life of one African matters much to us with no reference to the part of the continent he or she comes from. ”The act is in contravention of the international convention on the protection of the right of migrants and workers and the members of their families as encapsulated in articles 9,10 and 13 cum other articles of the treaty,” he said. The Speaker added that the treaty provides that everybody should be treated equally and called on world leaders to condemn the killing. He also called for proper investigation of the act, adding that such a move would end the rampant killings of Africans at borders. ”Human rights holds that everybody should be treated equally and with dignity no matter what their circumstances. ”We are calling for the genuinely impartial investigation of the incident taking account of the need to dispense justice for societal peace and stability in the interest of advancing the course of humanity. ”We are also calling on world leaders to collectively speak against the heinous act”, he said.
