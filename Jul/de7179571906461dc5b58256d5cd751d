Ataoja of Osogbo, Oba JImoh Olanipekun Oyetunji, has warned that he will take action against individuals whose desire is to disrupt the peace of Osogbo in the name of politics. Oba Oyetunji made this disclosure while addressing the campaign train of Ademola Adeleke, the Osun Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate while on a visit to his palace on Tuesday in Osogbo. In a video obtained by DAILY POST, the monarch who was visibly angry over pockets of politically motivated attacks across Osogbo, threatened to lay curses on anybody fomenting trouble and planning to bring disruption to Osogbo during his time as monarch. The Ataoja also warned the chairman of Olorunda Local Government chapter of the National Union of Road Transport Workers, Kazeem Oyewale, also known as Asiri Eniba, against orchestrating violence in the town. While warning that they should desist or face the wrath of the deities, he also threatened to lay curses on political thugs who are hired by politicians to attack members of other political parties ahead of the July 16 gubernatorial election in the State. “I want to say it emphatically that anyone who disturbs the peace of Osogbo land won’t know peace. Anyone who wants to destroy this land won’t know peace. “Go and tell them and let Asiri Eniba know that I won’t tolerate disruption of peace in my domain. Oyetola and the APC came to the palace, PDP didn’t attack them. I want you people to know that PDP enthroned me as monarch,” he said.
