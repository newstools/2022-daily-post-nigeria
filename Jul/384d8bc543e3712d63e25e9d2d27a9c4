Former Governor of Kano State, Rabiu Kwankwaso has said that the activities of Biafra agitators in the South-East will not allow him to become the running mate to Peter Obi of the Labour Party in the forthcoming presidential election. Kwankwaso said that ordinarily he would have liked to be Obi’s running mate, since he is currently jobless, but maintained that northern voters will never vote any presidential candidate from the South-East. Featuring on Channels Television’s Sunday Politics, the New Nigerian Peoples Party, NNPP, presidential candidate, said that being Obi’s running mate would mean both of them will lose the election because northern voters will vote for a northern candidate. For this reason, Kwankwaso believes that those asking him to become Obi’s running mate are enemies, who already know what the outcome would be. “That is what the enemy outside there is saying [that I should be running mate to Peter Obi]. The implication is that if you put somebody from the South-East, unfortunately, there are many issues in the South-East. “You see, the northern voter is the worst hit in this issue of maladministration In this country. But even in that circumstance, the northern voter believes he is better off with one united Nigeria. “Therefore, most of the things that are happening in the South, especially the South-East, people are not comfortable with that and as long as you have anybody from there in any party, it would be very difficult for the northern voter to vote.” When asked if he would desire to be Obi’s running mate, the former Governor added, “You see, I’m jobless now. I’m not doing any job. So becoming a vice president [why not?]”
