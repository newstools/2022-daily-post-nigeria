Former Arsenal star, Kevin Campbell, believes Cristiano Ronaldo’s departure from Manchester United could put 25-year-old Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong off from joining the Red Devils. Ronaldo had last weekend informed Man United he wanted to leave the club due to the lack of Champions League football next season. The Portugal captain netted 24 goals in 38 appearances and was one of the few bright sparks for United. It was reported last week that Man United were in advanced talks with Barcelona to sign De Jong, who would be reunited with his former manager Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford. However, Campbell believes Ronaldo’s absence may discourage the Dutch star from moving to Old Trafford. “That is going to be a problem. Players will come to United to play with Ronaldo,” Campbell told Football Insider. “Let’s have it right, it’s a lure. Players would love to play with him. Once players hear that Ronaldo wants to leave, players will ask themselves, ‘Who else have you got?'” “It is not the same proposition even though it is Manchester United, a huge, massive club. Without Ronaldo, there they are not the same proposition. That is the harsh truth of the matter.”
