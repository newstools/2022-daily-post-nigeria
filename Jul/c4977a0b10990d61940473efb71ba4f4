The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said the African Action Congress (AAC) and New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) are yet to upload details of their governorship candidates on the electoral body’s nomination portal. While Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso is the NNPP presidential candidate, Dumebi Kachikwu is ADC flag bearer. Parties are expected to put up the names of their candidates for the governorship and state assembly elections by July 15. INEC, in a statement signed on Wednesday by its national Commissioner, Information and Voter Education, Festus Okoye, said it has so far processed 6,995 nomination forms uploaded by 16 out of 18 political parties for the constituencies where they intend to sponsor candidates. “However, two political parties, the African Action Congress (AAC) and New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), are yet to upload a single nomination to the portal. “The Commission hereby reminds all political parties that they have three days left to upload their list of candidates to the ICNP. The deadline is Friday 15th July 2022. The portal will automatically shut down at 6.00pm on that date,” the statement read.
