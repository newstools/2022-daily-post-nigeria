Kulen Allah Cattle Rearers Association of Nigeria, (KACRAN), a Fulani socio-cultural group, has noted that its members will only cast their votes for a presidential candidate who meets their interests at heart. The group said, its votes would go to the candidate who will fully incorporate livestock development in his policies and programs. Khalil Mohd Bello, KACRAN’s National President, in a statement issued on Tuesday explained that any candidate who fails to do so risks losing bloc votes from the group in the 2023 general elections. The group lamented that they are usually ignored when it came to policy and programme formulations despite herders’ numerous contributions to the nation’s economic development and provision of nutritional food to Nigerians. The statement said, “Most politicians, with the exception of very few states, are neither mindful nor concerned with the vital role played by the livestock sector towards creating millions of job opportunities for our youths and people whose livelihood fully depends on the pastoral occupation.” KACRAN noted that it is only through the creation of the Federal Ministry of Animal resources that herders’ problems and daily pressing needs related to water points or animal feed during the dry period will be adequately taken care of. The National President, therefore, congratulated Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Atiku Abubakar; Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso and Peter Obi, the presidential candidates of APC, PDP, NNPP and LP and others, for their emergence as candidates for their parties, appealing to them to incorporate livestock development in their policies and programmes during their campaign exercises. The group reminded Nigerian politicians to note that they have millions of herders who have their PVCs at hand and are ready to vote their choice.
