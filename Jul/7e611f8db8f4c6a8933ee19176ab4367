The Nigerian Security and Civil Defense Corps, NSCDC, have warned Nigerians about the ongoing fake recruitment into the service. The NSCDC Commandant in Jigawa State, Musa Mala gave the warning while speaking at the 2019 recruits passing out ceremony held at Dutse stadium, Dutse the state capital. He said, “we have been receiving reports that some heartless and unscrupulous individuals are defrauding the public in the name of recruitment into the Corps” “Our Intelligence team is working assiduously to identify, arrest and bring to book the perpetrators of such dubious act” ” Let me also use this opportunity to reiterate and inform the general public, that NSCDC is not recruiting at the moment and any recruitment into the Corps is always made public through the relevant media channels, not through individuals.” The commandant warned. He said the 97 Jigawa NSCDC trainees are part of the 5,000 newly recruited, absorbed and trained nationwide. The commandant urged them to be dedicated, committed and honest in discharging their assigned duties. ”I want you to be good ambassadors of the Corps anytime and anywhere” He stated.
