Tola Awosika, an All Progressives Congress (APC) Senatorial aspirant in Ondo State has dumped the party. The hopeful addressed his resignation letter to APC Chairman, Ward 11 of Ondo West Local Government. Awosika said he envisioned a party where the youths are not just given access but are treated equally and on merit. The entrepreneur noted that he was not desperate to contest but desires a better society where the young and old have unfettered access to basic necessities. Awosika said after the primary elections, supporters requested to know the next move “as the APC has become a haven of vendetta and injustice”. “It has become impossible for young vibrant people who are passionate about service and ready to give back to the people to achieve their desires in APC.” The aspirant added that he was left with no choice but to keep working hard to secure the future of Ondo people. Awosika lost the Ondo Central Senatorial District ticket to Adeniyi Adegbonmire, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN). Adegbonmire beat Tayo Alasoadura, a former Minister of State for Niger Delta Affairs, to second place.
