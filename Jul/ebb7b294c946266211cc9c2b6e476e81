Operatives of the Bayelsa State vigilante service have arrested two suspected criminals over a robbery attempt on a trader inside the popular Swali Market in Yenagoa, the state capital. The suspects, identified as John Clement, (22) from Ekeremor and Austin Godsown, (33) from Southern Ijaw LGA, were apprehended while robbing a trader. The victim, Mr. Edet said the two suspects accosted him inside the market and threatened to shoot him dead if he does not hand over all his valuables to them. Edet said, “The two of them approached me, and one of them pretended to have a gun under his shirt and threatened to waste me if I fail to give them everything I have on me. They spent more than 10 minutes with me and passersby never suspected I was being robbed” Another trader confirmed that the two suspects are members of a gang that move around in the market area always terrorizing customers and most times traders in the market. The Chairman of the State Vigilante Service, Doubiye Alagba, who confirmed the incident said the suspects were arrested following a tip-off from someone inside the market who noticed what was happening and came out to inform the vigilante group. ”And that was how we were able to intervene and got them arrested on the spot. They have since been handed over to A Division of the Nigeria Police Force, Bayelsa State Chapter, for further investigation”.
