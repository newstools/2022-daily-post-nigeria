A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Segun Showunmi, has berated the All Progressives Congress (APC) for picking a Muslim as its presidential candidate and the running mate. DAILY POST reports that the presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Tinubu, has picked another Muslim, Kashim Shettima, as his running mate. Shettima, a former governor of Borno State was announced on Sunday as the APC vice presidential candidate. In his swift reaction, Showunmi, an aide to the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, said Tinubu and his party hate Nigeria. While saying decisions ought to have consequences, Showunmi maintained that “a nation that is almost evenly divided between the major faiths of Christianity and Islam must work very hard not to give the impression that the sensitivity to diversity does not matter!” In his quest to know, Showunmi asked that, “Shall we now assume that the APC intends to play only to the numbers advantage without care for national unity and harmony by their share insensitivity to what’s going on in the country?” Showunmi asserted that the APC “have made a choice, now they must be made to pay for the consequences of their extreme lack of thoughtfulness.” He spoke further, “What do they think they are doing? No, they need to lose so that they get the message that parties that balance their tickets do so to inspire national cohesion. “May the people of goodwill who love our national diversity punish APC for this decision. “Failing this we may become a nation that tilts dangerously towards one of the faiths. “Antioch, where Paul the Apostle wrote, is now known as Antakya, losing all of its original ideology. “Nigeria is a secular state and all things must be done to protect its secularity!”
