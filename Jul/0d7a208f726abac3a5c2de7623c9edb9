Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), has urged the federal government to live up to his statutory responsibility and avert socio-economic incidents that bring extreme shock and stress to the national population. Obi made the call in a series of tweets on Thursday while reacting to the recent collapse of the national grid. DAILY POST reports that the national grid crashed to zero megawatts for the umpteenth time on Wednesday after it developed a fault. A similar collapse occurred on June 12 and 20 days after the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) activated a partial contract order for the Nigerian electricity market to guarantee 5,000MW and at least 4,000MW. The grid went blank for the fifth time in 2022 at about 12 noon on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) on Thursday said restoration of the national grid is almost completed following its collapse on Wednesday. Reacting to the development, Obi wrote on Twitter: “Reports that the national power grid has collapsed for the 6th time in 7 months is alarming. Once again, many Nigerians have been left groping around in darkness without electricity. “Such negative parameters are not only benchmarks for governance failure but a compelling catalyst for a leadership change. “Moreover, in a nation where many go to bed hungry, and national bakers going on strike is indicative of the high-stress level in both the productive realm of our economy and quality of life. “Also, for bread, one of the basic and affordable daily sustenance of the average Nigerian, to become unavailable translates to a national crisis. “Government must live up to its statutory responsibilities to avert socio-economic incidents that induce extreme shock and stress on the national population.”
