Oyeyemi directed Commanding Officers of the Corps nationwide to collaborate with the Police Force to enforce the order.

The FRSC chief also ordered the seizure of private vehicles using commercial number plates. Oyeyemi noted that faded and other unauthorised plates posed a threat to national security. “The use of the SPY and other unauthorised number plates to continually violate traffic rules and regulations must be brought to a halt. “Directive is given to Commanding Officers to brace up and ensure that they give adequate priority to the enforcement”, the CM added.
