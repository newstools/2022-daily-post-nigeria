Barcelona manager, Xavi Hernandez has given a reason why his team defeated Real Madrid in Sunday’s El Clasico pre-season friendly tie. Barcelona defeated Real Madrid in Las Vegas, thanks to Raphinha’s stunning strike. However, Xavi believes Barcelona won against Carlo Ancelotti’s men because the Blaugrana were the better team, adding that they suffered towards the end of the tie. “We came here to win and we did it. We suffered towards the end of the game, but I am still satisfied with today’s match,” Xavi said at his post-match press conference. “We were the better team. At Barcelona, there are no friendly matches. We always want to win, especially against Real Madrid.” He added, “The first half was brilliant, but the second half was complicated.”
