As Muslims across the world celebrate this year’s Eid-el-Kabir, former Governor of Ondo State, Olusegun Mimiko has called for honesty and love among Nigerians. According to Mimiko in a statement by John Paul Akinduro, his Special Assistant on Media and Digital Communications, Nigeria is at the moment going through a trying time. He maintained that the country is battling a plethora of unprecedented security crises and economic challenges. He stressed that Nigerians must stick together in the face of the challenges in order to fashion out workable and honest solutions to the myriad of problems bedevilling the country. In light of the recent attack on the Kuje Correctional Centre and the random killings that have occurred throughout the nation, Mimiko urged the security agencies to increase the protection of residential areas, roads, and other sensitive locations. The former governor encouraged Muslims to use the Eid season to reach out to their neighbours and the less privileged in society and remember that the entire point of the celebration is love and submission to God and living right by ourselves and by those around us.
