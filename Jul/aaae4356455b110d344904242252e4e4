The Igbo World Union (IWU) has called on the South-East Governors to boldly take a step and approach the Presidency for the release of Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the proscribed Indigenous Peoples of Biafra, IPOB. It also pleaded with the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to ensure that willing and eligible voters are not disenfranchised in the forthcoming general election. President-General of the group, His Imperial Majesty, Mishak Nnanta said this in an interview with newsmen in Umuahia, Capital of Abia State. Nnanta also appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to extend his milk of human kindness to Ndi Igbo by applying a political solution to resolve Kanu’s case. The group affirmed that though an unconditional release of Nnamdi Kanu runs contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers between the Executive and Judiciary, President Buhari could use his prerogative to release Kanu from detention. Nnanta regretted that the continued detention of Kanu had introduced the monstrous and retrogressive ‘sit-at-home’ order with the attendant massive deterioration of security situation and debilitation of the South East economy. Also, the Abia state Governorship Candidate of African Democratic Congress, ADC, and founder, Vision Africa International, Bishop Sunday Ndukwo Onuoha called on the Federal Government to seek a political solution in Nnamdi Kanu’s case to reduce tension in the South East. Bishop Onuoha, who was a member of the 2021 South-East delegation led by first republic minister, Chief Amaechi Mbazulike, to see President Muhammadu Buhari, appealed that the case of the proscribed IPOB leader be given a political solution. DAILY POST recalls that Kanu is facing trial over an alleged treasonable felony and has been in the DSS custody in Abuja.
