The national leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) is yet to congratulate Osun governor-elect Ademola Oyetola. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) flagbearer defeated Governor Gboyega Oyetola in a keenly contested battle. The former Senator won in 17 of the 30 local government areas in the poll conducted in 3,763 units. Adeleke received 403,371 votes while Oyetola got 375,027. More than 24 hours after the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared him the winner, the ruling APC has remained silent. Oyetola spoke Sunday afternoon but refused to congratulate his main challenger. In a chat with DAILY POST on Monday on anonymity, an APC chieftain explained that the leaders were studying events. The insider who commented anonymously noted that the party cannot make any pronouncement before its standard bearer. “We cannot say anything yet because the governor is yet to speak. What if we reject and the candidate concedes? “What if we congratulate and the candidate decides to go to court? Don’t forget that has a right to seek legal redress. “So, as things stand now, we have to wait for his position on the outcome of the election.” Reminded that President Muhammadu Buhari already reacted, the source said it was the right thing to do. “You can’t compare. The statement by the President is normal, he is the leader of Nigeria. Whether APC wins or loses, he congratulates the winner. “But for the party, it is politics. The party is different from the presidency. We will consider some things before we come out with an official position”, the member added.
