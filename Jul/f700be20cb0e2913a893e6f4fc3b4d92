Ahead of Saturday’s Osun State governorship election, a former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Timi Frank, on Thursday, called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security agencies not to connive with the ruling party to deny the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of victory. He urged the electoral umpire to remain truly independent in all processes and stamp its feet against monetary inducement of voters on Saturday, noting that Osun governorship poll is an isolated election that the world was interested in its credibility. Comrade Frank in a statement, he made available to DAILY POST in Abuja, revealed that, “he has credible intelligence at his disposal to the effect that the APC has concluded plans to rig the Osun State governorship election through intimidation, harassment and mass arrest of PDP leaders and supporters in the state. According to him, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) was enmeshed in credibility crisis due to the controversial Muslim-Muslim 2023 ticket, hence, they would do anything to steal the mandates of peoples to cover up as of electorates were still in support of the party. He said: “The APC was unpopular because of their hidden agenda to Islamise Nigeria through a Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket for 2023.” “We don’t also want a repeat of the last governorship election in Osun State, where the candidate of the PDP won but INEC connived with APC by declaring the election inconclusive during declaration of results.” Frank called on INEC to work with security agencies to arrest the trend of vote-buying which he described as a show of shame to the nation’s democracy, while calling on the United States of America, United Kingdom and other leading members of the international community to help entrench democratic culture in Nigeria.
