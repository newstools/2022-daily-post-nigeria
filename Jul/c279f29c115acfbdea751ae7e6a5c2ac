Bayern Munich director, Oliver Kahn has admitted they are in the race to sign Matthijs de Ligt from Juventus. The Bundesliga side are looking for a defender who can bring leadership, loudness and presence. Kahn said: “We’re happy with the quality we have at centre-back. “But we can improve when it comes to leadership, loudness and presence.” De Ligt is Chelsea’s top defensive target this summer, as Thomas Tuchel looks for replacements for Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen. Juventus value De Ligt at closer to €100m (£86m), around £10m more than they paid Ajax three years ago.
