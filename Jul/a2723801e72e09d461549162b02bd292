Nollywood actor, Yul Edochie has reacted to a viral video of colleague, Kenneth Jideofor, better known as Kenneth Aguba. The news of Kenneth Aguba being homeless circulated on Monday on social media after a photo showed the frail-looking actor in a shabby environment at a park, near Abakpa in Enugu State. Reacting, Yul offered to help the actor, demanding that Aguba should share his bank details online so that contributions could be made for him. He assured that after this was done, Aguba will never lack again. Alongside his picture, Edochie wrote “This one is a small matter. I don’t believe in too much talk or time-wasting. Just get him to do a short video calling out his account details and post it online. “We will do crowdfunding for him. He’ll never lack anything again.”
