Governor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State has asked All Progressives Congress (APC) members to ignore opposition parties who are “only strong on social media”. Uzodimma stated this during a meeting with party members and stakeholders in Imo on Friday. The governor’s comment is most likely a swipe at the Labour Party (LP) and its presidential candidate, Peter Obi. LP and Obi have been criticised for being more prominent on social media and not having a structure ahead of the 2023 elections. “This opposition that is only strong on social media with no political structure on the ground, you are listening to them,” Uzodimma said. “Our people should not be deceived. Don’t let anybody deceive you. “If you follow a party that is reminding you of the agony of the past but is not interested in telling you how you will better your tomorrow, you don’t have to blame anybody. “But as a people, as a party, I am here as the governor of the state through a political party called APC. That is our political party.”
