Five suspected armed robbers were gunned down in a duel with operatives attached to the “B” Division in Warri, a surveillance team in Delta State on Friday. The suspects, who sustained serious gunshot injuries, died while being rushed to the hospital, DAILY POST can report. The police operatives also recovered two locally-made cut-to-size single barrel guns, three rounds of expended cartridges, three rounds of live cartridges, and one dagger from the suspects. It was learnt that the police operatives who were on “Aberdeen” patrol along lower Erejuwa Street in Warri, received a distress call that a suspected armed robbery gang was terrorizing Igbudu market/old welfare. The teams, acting on this distress, moved to the scene where the hoodlums on sighting the police took to their heels, and the team went after them. “Somewhere around old welfare road, the hoodlums went into a gun duel with the Operatives, but could not withstand the superior firepower of the police. During the gun duel, five of the hoodlums sustained serious gunshot injuries,” Bright Edafe, the Police Public Relations Officer, said in a statement. He said,” Investigation in ongoing.”
