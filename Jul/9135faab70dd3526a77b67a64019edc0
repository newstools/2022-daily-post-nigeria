The leader Of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele has reacted to the controversies over reports of bishops present at the unveiling of Kashim Shettima as the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential running mate. Primate Ayodele said the fake bishops at Shettima’s unveiling was an indication of what Christians should expect if APC retains power in 2023. About 30 bishops had attended the official unveiling of Shettima as the running mate to the APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu. However, Ayodele said the viral ‘fake’ bishops that attended Shettima’s unveiling had shown that the APC wants to kill Christianity and that the presidential candidate of the party doesn’t mean well for Christians in the country. In a statement by his spokesman, the clergyman said they have gone as far as corrupting the Christian system, adding that Christians will be deceived and be silenced if they mistakenly get power. He pointed out that poverty was the tool used to lure the fake bishops to attend the unveiling of the presidential running mate. ‘’On the ‘fake’ bishops that attended the unveiling of the party’s presidential running mate, it is clear now that the APC wants to kill Christianity, the presidential candidate doesn’t mean well for Christians and that’s why they have gone as far as corrupting the Christian system. “This has shown that the presidential aspirant of the party cannot rule Nigeria, this is how the government will fake us, deny Christians, lure Christians to vote for them only to silence them in power. “I can’t blame the ‘bishops’ that were at the unveiling, the party used poverty as a tool to entice them and these are the gimmicks they want to use to win the election, showering the country with poverty.’’
