The Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom, has said that Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), should have consulted Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, before choosing his running mate. Atiku picked Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, as his running mate for the 2023 election. But Ortom, speaking on Channels Television on Thursday night, claimed 14 out of 17 members of a committee set up by the PDP to guide the former vice president had preferred Wike. “The candidate who won the primary has the final say, I have no problem with that. “But I think that moving forward Wike would have been reached out to. Even some of us who were supporting Wike, we would have been told,” he said. Ortom also reiterated that he was consulting with God on his choice for president in 2023.
