A former governor of Jigawa State, Sule Lamido has alleged that some people are instigating Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State against the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. Lamido spoke during an interview with BBC Hausa on Monday. He noted that Wike was a responsible and committed PDP member. The former governor, however, pointed out that the Rivers helmsman exhibits signs of youthful exuberance. “We did a national convention. The highest gathering of decision making of the PDP chose Atiku. Wike contested and lost. Wike is a responsible and committed man but there is some youthful exuberance in him. “There are people that are inciting him but the deed has been done and this did not start now. It happened with Peter Odili, it happened with Osinbajo. He should learn a lesson from them,” he said. Wike is aggrieved over Atiku’s choice of running mate. Upon his emergence as PDP’s presidential candidate, Atiku picked Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State as his running mate. The former Vice President had rejected the recommendations of a committee set up on selection of his running mate. The 16-man committee had recommended Wike, who came second during the party’s primary election. However, Atiku ignored the committee’s recommendations and picked Okowa.
