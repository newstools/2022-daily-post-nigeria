The spokesman of Northern Elders Forum, NEF, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, has highlighted reasons the 2023 general elections would be the most decisive since 1999. Baba-Ahmed said the 2023 elections would show if Nigerians have decided to reverse the journey to destruction. He pointed out that the next general election would show if Nigeria would sink towards destruction. The NEF spokesman made the remark while urging Nigerians to ensure they take advantage of the remaining seven days and register for their Permanent Voters Cards, PVCs. The time frame issued by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, for registration and collection of PVCs would end in the next seven days. Baba-Ahmed, in a tweet wrote: “2023 elections are the most decisive since 1999.They will show whether we have decided to reverse the journey to destruction, or we will sink irretrievably towards destruction. “Will you be part of those who will decide,or will you watch others do it.Register and vote.7 days left.”
