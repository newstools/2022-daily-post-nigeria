Reality TV star, Tacha Akide has said she wants to have a child before the year ends. Tacha said this during Blackbox Roundtable conversation with Ebuka Obi-Uchendu. Ebuka in his recent episode tagged ‘The It Girls of BBNaija’ asked the ex-female housemates their perspective on marriage. Tacha, responding, said she would love to get married if it comes. She went ahead to say she would love to have a child this year regardless of her marital status. “I want to have a child this year if I can,” Tacha told Ebuka. Ebuka also asked the ladies why there’s a narrative that BBNaija girls are not marriage material. Responding, Tacha said she feels that men are intimidated by most BBNaija ladies, who she described as ‘powerful women’ when they are out of the house. “So that narrative that BBNaija girls are not marriage material is wrong. Most men don’t come to us because they feel like there are so many people in your corner so don’t know how to approach you. “These boys are intimidated. I think some men are threatened by powerful women but the men not coming through is their loss,” she said.
