The Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Mahmood Yakubu, has disclosed that the commission wants the Osun State governorship election to be better than the recently concluded Ekiti State governorship poll and the upcoming 2023 general election. Yakubu stated this on Monday while inspecting non-sensitive materials at the INEC office, Osogbo, alongside Osun State Resident Electoral Commissioner, Professor Abdulganiy Raji, with other officials of the commission. He also urged electoral officers of INEC to be proactive in their duties ahead of the election, especially making appropriate plans for logistics before the exercise. DAILY POST reports that this year’s Osun governorship election will be held on July 16. “Identify the Registration Area Centers (RAC) so that on the election day, you can activate the centres as early as 6 am. We should be waiting for the electorate, not otherwise,” Yakubu said. “Remember, Ekiti was good, but we want Osun to beat our record in Ekiti and the 2023 General election. “We rely on you for transportation arrangements, early movement of materials, liaison with the security, moving them in good time…we must do this right. At the RAC centres, ensure adequate electricity so that they can recharge some of the equipment like the Bimodal Voters Accreditation System (BVAS) and power banks so that on Election Day, we can have a seamless exercise.”
