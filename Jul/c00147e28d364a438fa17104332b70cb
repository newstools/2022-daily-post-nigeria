Nollywood actress, Kate Henshaw, has condemned the assault on Prophet Chukwuemeka Ohanaemere aka Odumeje, over the demolition of his church in Onitsha Anambra State. A viral video of Odumeje on Thursday showed security personnel of Anambra task force manhandling him for attempting to stop the demolition exercise. Reacting to the video in a Twitter post on Thursday, Kate Henshaw wrote: “Why must there always be an assault on the person. Is there no decorum? When they are not animals.” Odumeje’s church, Mountain of Holy Ghost Intervention and Deliverance Ministry, located at Fegge-Onitsha was in April 2022 marked by the Anambra State Physical Planning Board (ANSPPB) for outright demolition. According to Anambra State Government, Odumeje’s church blocks water flow at the Nwangele-Bida drainage.
