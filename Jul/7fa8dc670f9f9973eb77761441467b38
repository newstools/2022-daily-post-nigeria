Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that said the Western artillery his country have received have “started working very powerfully.” The United States of America, the United Kingdom and other western countries and NATO members have been supplying weapons to the war-turn nation. Most recently, America delivered its HIMARS system to Ukraine, a weapon Zelensky’s country has confirmed as very useful. “Its accuracy is exactly as needed. Our defenders inflict very noticeable strikes on depots and other spots that are important for the logistics of the occupiers. “And this significantly reduces the offensive potential of the Russian army. “The losses of the occupiers will only increase every week, as will the difficulty of supplying them,” Zelensky said, according to CNN
