In a statement signed by his Media Aide, Osho Oluwatosin, the cleric urged world leaders to be watchful and call on God to avert the deadly disease. Primate Ayodele called on African leaders to pray against the massive spread of meningitis in the continent, especially in Nigeria, while revealing that he foresees traces of Ebola in some African countries. Furthermore, the man of God revealed that there will be a permanent solution for cancer globally in the next three years. According to Ayodele: “I foresee another deadly disease rising up, it will not be sustainable for 48 hours, and we have to be very watchful and prayerful. World leaders need to work on this to avert another global pandemic. Also, Covid-19 will rise again in some European countries; it is not yet over in Europe. “Let us pray, so we will not experience meningitis in Africa and Nigeria. There will be traces of Ebola in some parts of Africa. “I foresee a permanent solution for cancer in the next three years.”
