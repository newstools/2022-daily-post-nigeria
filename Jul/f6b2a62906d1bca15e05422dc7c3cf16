The Chief Executive Officer of Always Petroleum, Alhaji Muhammed Jamiu Idris has been kidnapped. He was kidnapped in the early hours of Saturday at his residence in Idare, Okene Local Government Area of Kogi State. A family source who did not want his name mentioned told DAILY POST that gunmen with sophisticated weapons stormed his residence and whisked him away to an unknown destination. Idris, who doubles as the chairman, North Central Table Tennis Association, according to the source was beaten and tied before they whisked him away to an unknown destination. No contact has been made from the kidnappers to any of the family members at the time of filing this report. Efforts to reach the Police Public Relations Officer in Kogi State, SP William Ovye Aya about the incident proved abortive as he did not pick up calls or respond to text messages sent to his phone line.
