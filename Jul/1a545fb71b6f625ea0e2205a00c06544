Senator Shehu Sani has condemned the move by the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, to stop the British High Commissioner, Catriona Laing from visiting the Southeast. DAILY POST recalls that the secessionist group, on Thursday, in a statement by its spokesman, Emma Powerful asked Catriona Laing to suspend her planned visit. The group said the reason “for this sincere security advice is to save her life”. Reacting, Shehu Sani, a former governorship aspirant in Kaduna State, said in a tweet that the warning may not reflect the general view of the people in the region. “If actually, the separatist group in the South East has issued threats to the British High Commissioner, Catriona Laing not to visit the South East, then that threat is condemnable. “And I believe it doesn’t reflect the views of the people of the region except otherwise stated,” he wrote.
