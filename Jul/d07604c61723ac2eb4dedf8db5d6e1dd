Apostle Johnson Suleman of Omega Fire Ministries has denied mocking the separation of Nollywood actress, Funke Akindele and her husband, JJC Skillz. The break up was disclosed yesterday in a statement by JJC Skillz. Shortly after the news of the separation surfaced online, Apostle Suleman had tweeted about “break up.” Apostle Suleman had tweeted: “Stop disturbing us with break up stories. “When they bought you shawarma, did you give us?” Suleman’s tweet was seen by tweeps as throwing shades at the actress and her estranged husband. Amid the backlash, the cleric explained that his earlier tweet was not directed at anybody. He noted that it was a sin to mock people, stressing that his earlier tweet was a mere coincidence. He tweeted: “Someone just called my attention to the ‘break up’ tweet. It has nothing to do with anyone pls. “I tweet random tweets, parables, jokes and comments. It must have been a coincidence, it’s a sin to mock people. “Disregard any insinuations, it was a joke and nothing else!”
