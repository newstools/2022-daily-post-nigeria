Candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Hon. Saheed Ali, has been declared winner of a councillorship bye-election conducted by the Ogun State Independent Electoral Commission (OGSIEC), in Joga/Ibooro Ward 5 of Yewa North Local Government Area of the State. In line with the Ogun State Electoral Law, the State Independent Electoral Commission (OGSIEC), has conducted a Bye-Election into Joga/Ibooro Ward 5 in Yewa North Local Government Area, to elect another Councilor to complete the tenure of the former Councilor. Ali was declared winner by the OGSIEC, having garnered 1,749 majority votes. DAILY POST reports that only the APC indicated interest in the election, but an election was held in accordance with the requirement of the Ogun State electoral law that a candidate must get 50 per cent of votes to be declared winner. Recall that the bye-election became imperative due to the death of the former Councilor, Hon. Sunday Ogundele. Across the eight polling units where the election was held, voters turned out to exercise their franchise, giving Ali the legal right to be declared winner despite the fact that he had no opponents.
