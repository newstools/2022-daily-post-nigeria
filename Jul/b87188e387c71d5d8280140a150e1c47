Former Chelsea star, Joe Cole has hailed the signing of Raheem Sterling from Manchester City. Cole said that Sterling will help Chelsea’s attacking players, Timo Werner, Mason Mount, Kai Havert and Christian Pulisic. He also described Sterling as ‘one of England’s best players,’ adding that Chelsea’s decision to sign him was ‘great business’. Sterling completed a £50million move to Chelsea on Wednesday, penning a five-year deal worth more than £300,000-a-week. Speaking to BBC Sport, Cole said: “Chelsea are getting one of England’s best players in the prime of his career at a good price. It’s a great bit of business. “It helps us in the final third of the pitch – he’s a goalscorer and he can help the young players. “We are very young in that area – Kai Havertz, Mason Mount, Timo Werner, Christian Pulisic. Raheem is five or six years older than them, has more games under his belt and has been around the block. “He can help with the leadership group as well. He’s part of the leadership group for England. We’ve lost Antonio Rudiger, so he will be very important on and off the pitch.”
