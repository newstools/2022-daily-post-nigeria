Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi, on Thursday lamented the increasing cases of rape in the state. He, however, vowed that henceforth, there will be no show of mercy on perpetrators. The governor, who also reshuffled his cabinet members, made this known in a statement signed and issued to journalists shortly after an executive council meeting on Thursday. Umahi said: “EXCO reviewed the unfortunate increase in the rate of rape in Ebonyi State and commended the office of Her Excellency, the Wife of the Governor and the Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development for a very beautiful job they are doing in the fight against rape in the state. “EXCO directed that there should be no sacred cow in the enforcement of the Laws on Rape. EXCO directed that there should be urgent State campaigns against rape in public institutions including churches, schools, markets and other public places. “EXCO also noted the submissions on increased use of hard drugs in the society and designated Mr. Mark Onu to head the campaign against hard drugs and to go to all joints and market places and to work with police and Ebubeagu Security outfit to apprehend the perpetrators,” he stressed. “EXCO also released the sum of Nine Hundred Million Naira (N900,000,000.00) for empowerment which is a by-product of #EndSARS and directed beneficiaries to go to the office of the Deputy Governor for final verification and documentation of their names. “The list shall be forwarded to the office of the Commissioner for Information and State Orientation for publication in at least two National Dailies ahead of the disbursement flag-off exercise,” he said.
