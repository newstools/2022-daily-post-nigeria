President Muhammadu Buhari has been urged to try all his possible best to resolve the six months lingering ASUU strike to allow students return to classes before the commencement of Tuesday’s proposed NLC National protest. Speaking in Kano a Traditional Tittle holder, Gambo Danpass, said President Muhammadu Buhari should summons an emergency meeting and ensure that the strike action is called off without delay. Danpass also urged the National Assembly to ensure that the Academic Union see reasons to call off the strike. He said the Minister of Labour and Productivity, Chris Ngige has no reason for a long time to be the mediator of the ASUU strike while in the real sense he has little or nothing to offer. “Although it is a bit late in removing the Labour Minister as the mediator in the lingering strike, and allowing the Education Minister, Adamu Adamu handle it, still the President should directly come in and resolve the matter himself”. “Right now we have thousands of our children roaming around the streets without anything so the government should know that they are willing tools in creating uncertainty in the peace of the nation”. He also urged President Muhammadu Buhari to take drastic measures in tackling the incessant abductions and killings of innocent Nigerians.
