The amount of money manager Mauricio Pochettino will receive after agreeing to leave Paris Saint-Germain has been revealed. Pochettino and his coaching staff have come to an agreement with PSG and will now be consigned to the club’s history books. According to L’Equipe, Pochettino, who had failed to reach an agreement regarding the termination of his contract at PSG, has accepted a payment of ten million euros as compensation for the remaining year, which was left on his Parisians contract. As a result, the PSG coaching staff is now vacant but not for long, as Christophe Galtier has already confirmed his exit from Nice. Galtier will be the next manager to take over the position that Pochettino has left in PSG. Recall that Pochettino has spent a season and a half at PSG after joining the French Ligue 1 champions in January 2021. In 2021, Pochettino saw Lille take Ligue 1 from him, but he was able to guide PSG back to the top of the French Ligue 1 standings last season.
