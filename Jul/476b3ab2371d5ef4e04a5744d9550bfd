Southampton are looking to wrap up a deal for Rangers midfielder Joe Aribo in the coming days. Premier League new boys, Nottingham Forest and Fulham are also keen to lure Aribo from the Scottish Premiership giants. But the Saints, according to the Daily Mail, are stepping up their interest in the player. The Nigerian international has a year left on his contract and seems not willing to extend his stay at the Ibrox. The Gers are reportedly prepared to sell the 25-year-old in order not to lose him on a free next summer. The former Charlton Athletic player is highly-rated because of his versatility. Aribo further showcased his versatility last season playing as a striker following the injury to Alfredo Morelos. He scored nine goals and recorded 10 assists in 57 appearances across all competitions for Giovanni van Bronckhorst’s side last season.
