The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has expressed sadness over the death of Olori Kafayat, one of the wives of the late Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi III. Gbajabiamila said Olori Kafayat’s passing was a painful one coming only a few months after the death of the Alaafin. This was disclosed in a statement by Lanre Lasisi, Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to the Speaker, House of Representatives, Federal Republic of Nigeria, and forwarded to DAILY POST on Saturday. The Speaker described the late Olori Kafayat as a good wife and mother who ensured peaceful coexistence among the people of Oyo Kingdom as the wife of the Alaafin. He said it was unfortunate that Olori Kafayat died at a time when the entire family of the late Alaafin needed her more as a mother. Gbajabiamila, while praying to God to grant the late Olori Kafayat eternal rest, sent his condolences to the Government and people of Oyo, particularly the Oyo Kingdom and the family of the late Alaafin.
