Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, has ordered the Head of Service, Pastor John Adeyemo, to dismiss any civil servant receiving double salaries from the state. While reviewing the Committee for the Verification, Scrutinization, and Clean-up of the State Payroll’s report, Akeredolu issued the directive. The governor set up a seven-man team to regularly purge the payroll of transgressions because he thought that the State Payroll, which includes wages and pensions, had been corrupted. The committee delivered its findings to the governor on Wednesday at his office in Alagbaka, Akure, under the chairman and former Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Mr. Victor Olajorin. Upon receiving the reports, Akeredolu scowled at the various payroll violations found and bemoaned the excessively large workforce, which he claimed was brought on by a large number of ghost workers. He further ordered that until the Salary Verification Committee has completed its work, all Ministries, Departments, and Parastatals in the State shall cease all recruitment efforts. “We have an over-bloated workforce, and undoubtedly, I am sure there are many ghost workers. Those who are receiving double salaries, apart from recovering the money from them, I am directing the Head of Service to get them dismissed. They must serve as a deterrent to others.” The committee’s first and most important action, according to Mr. Olajorin, was to get in touch with the various services, including the Teaching Service Commission (TESCOM), Hospitals’ Management Board (HMB), and the Local Government Service Commission (LGSC), among others. He pointed out that in order to fulfill its duty, the committee also acquired crucial records such as the Nominal Roll, Disposition List, Pay Register, and Pension Payroll.
