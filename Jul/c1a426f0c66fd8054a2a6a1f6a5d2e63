The Centre for Justice on Religious and Ethnicity in Nigeria has opined that the decision of the All Progressive Congress (APC), to go for the same faith presidential candidate was spurred by its desire to propagate Islam, and the tenets of Boko Haram and ISWAP. The Centre, therefore, rejected in totality the same-faith presidential and vice-presidential ticket of the ruling party in a country with diverse religious beliefs. Rev. Kallamu Dikwa, the organisation’s Director-General, in a statement, said it was deeply concerned about the utterances of some Nigerians over who becomes the running mate to the presidential candidates of political parties for the 2023 general elections. The statement recalled that, “Over 200 Chibok school girls were abducted under the watch of then Governor Kashim Shettima and they have not been found till date.” “The picking of former Governor of Borno State, Sen. Kashim Shettima as presidential running mate of the All Progressives Congress, is a clear indication that Boko Haram and ISWAP activities of abducting our children from schools will fully be resumed,” the group claimed. He said “Nigerians must be careful with Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Kashim Shettima.” According to the Centre, a Christian/Christian or Muslim/Muslim ticket does not speak well on the sincerity of Nigerians in ensuring justice, equity and fairness to all for the progress, development and peaceful coexistence of the country.
