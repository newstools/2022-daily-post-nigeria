The Anambra State chapter of the Labour Party (LP) has collapsed all Peter Obi support groups in the state into the party. The party announced this yesterday, during the unveiling of its House of Assembly, House of Representatives and Senatorial candidates in the state. State Chairman of Labour Party, Ugochukwu Eneh who spoke at the event said: “We are here to strategize on how we can get at least 95 per cent of votes in Anambra State for our candidate, Mr Peter Obi. “The entire country is looking up to us to ensure that we are in the forefront of supporting our brother before they will think of how they can join. “We are here to collapse all support groups working for Obi into the Labour Party because the party is the only one that will be on the ballot, and we need to start early to sensitize people on where to vote, and what our logo is.” Senator Victor Umeh, a senatorial candidate of the party for Anambra Central, who spoke on behalf of all the candidates after the unveiling harped on the need to rescue Nigeria from collapse. “What you see here are some of the very best of Peter Obi’s team, who helped steer Anambra State during his days as governor. “Nigerians from all over have accepted Obi as the one who can salvage Nigeria. People are working every day, tirelessly to make Peter Obi the president. The rest of Nigeria has taken away from us the job of canvassing for Peter Obi, so we will follow them and make a President. “Nigeria is collapsing, and we need to join hands to salvage her, and we believe that the man who can do that is Mr Peter Obi.”
