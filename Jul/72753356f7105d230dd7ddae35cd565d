A former federal Lawmaker and All Progressives Candidate for the Eket Federal Constituency in Akwa Ibom State, Eseme Eyiboh has urged Nigerians to worry about the candidates that have the capacity to bring transformational leadership and not to dwell on religion or tribe. He noted that the problems ravaging the country were not a result of the Muslim-Muslim ticket. Speaking at the backdrop of the controversy surrounding the Bola Tinubu/Kashim Shettima joint ticket for the APC in the 2023 presidential election, Eyiboh in an interview with our correspondent on Monday urged Nigerians to look beyond religion or tribe and go for a candidate that would address the problems in the country. He said, “When we talk about Muslim-Muslim tickets, the question we must answer is: Is Nigeria’s dwindling fortunes, insecurity, poverty rating, content growth because of religion? The answer to my considered opinion is no! “The next question is what does Nigeria need to come out of her present state that we are concerned about? Nigeria needs transformational leadership, regardless of tribe, religion and primordial sentiments. Nigeria needs leadership that will be able to transform this country where we have opportunities and where people will have trust and ownership in governance.” The House of Representatives hopeful said the issue of corruption does not arise as a result of religion, adding that in countries such as India, China and Korea no one would say their prosperity and growth are the consequence of religion. “The issue of corruption, is it as a result of religion? The answer is no! If you go to places such as India, China, Japan and Korea, would you say that prosperity and growth are a consequence of religion? No. So, we should dethrone the issue of religion in our governance.” He said.
