The National President of the Actors Guild of Nigeria (AGN) Emeka Rollas has debunked claims that veteran actor, Kenneth Aguba was abandoned. Some fans called out the Actors Guild for neglecting its members after images of the actor living on the street, looking homeless circulated on social media. But, Rollas, in a statement issued on Instagram, said the Enugu State Chapter of the Guild and some members had been supportive in both provisions of accommodation and medical intervention for Aguba in the past four years. Emeka disclosed that Kenneth was never abandoned and that his recent condition, which deteriorated recently, could be a case of spiritual issue. The statement read: “The attention of the AGN has been drawn to an online viral picture of veteran actor, Kenneth Aguba living on the street. “The National President of AGN, Ejezie Emeka Rollas wishes to state clearly that the Guild has never abandoned Kenneth Aguba. “Enugu State chapter of the Guild and individual members have been supportive in providing accommodation and medical interventions in the past 4 years to the veteran actor until his matter, which could be a spiritual issue, degenerated recently. “The Guild does not make public issues regarding assistance to its members. “The National President frowns at the shades thrown at the leadership of the Guild since the story went viral, describing it as the handwork of detractors which may not be unconnected with the present towering reputation of the Guild.” He added that the Guild welcomes inquiries on issues regarding the welfare of members, as the Guild runs an open-door policy and urges the public to always verify their stories before expressing not-so-palatable statements. The National President also appreciated good-spirited members who have called to show concern and willingness to provide immediate intervention.
