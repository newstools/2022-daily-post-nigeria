No fewer than eight people lost their lives on Saturday in an automobile accident that occurred on the Ondo-Ore highway. The accident, which happened at the Ajue axis of the road, in Odigbo Local Government Area of the State, involved a commercial space bus and a truck. According to eyewitnesses, the commercial space bus which was coming from Akure end of the road had a head-on-collision with an Ore-bound truck, which was fully loaded with cows. The accident was said to have occurred when the driver of the truck rammed into the bus coming from the opposite direction while trying to avoid a pothole on the road. The eyewitnesses maintained that seven big cows also died in the accident. It took the efforts of other motorists and residents around the area to remove the bodies of the victims from the accident scene. Residents attributed the high rate of accidents in the area to the deplorable condition of roads. The Police Public Relations Officer in the State, SP Funmilayo Odunlami, however, disclosed that only two people died in the crash, with five injured. Odunlami, who added that four cows died in the accident, said the bodies of the deceased victims had been evacuated to the morgue, while those who sustained injuries were taken to an undisclosed hospital for treatment. “Two people died and five people were injured in the accident.
