The Labour Party, LP, presidential candidate, Peter Obi has been cautioned against his reported choice of Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed as his running mate. Deji Adeyanju, popular socio-political commentator, said Obi’s choice of Baba-Ahmed as his running mate was a political suicide. Reports have it that Obi would pick Baba-Ahmed, who is the proprietor of Baze University in Abuja and Baba-Ahmed University Kano, as his running mate on Friday. This followed the decision of Obi’s placeholder, Doyin Okupe, to step down as the party’s presidential running mate. However, Adeyanju said Baba-Ahmed cannot ensure LP win his local government area in 2023. In a Facebook post, Adeyanju said an alliance with the New Nigerian Peoples Party, NNPP, would have made more impact. He wrote: “It is political suicide to pick a VP candidate who cannot deliver something as ordinary as his LGA for you in a presidential election. Anyways, everyone will wake up from the social media delusion soon. “Kwankwaso can deliver his state, and many former Govs will also do well. When we criticize, we are doing so with deep understanding of Nigeria. One thing is clear now, this is nothing serious but just a social media good feeling presidency dream.”
