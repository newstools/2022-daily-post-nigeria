The presidential candidate of the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP), Rabiu Kwankwaso, has claimed that the South East will not allow Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), become his running mate. Kwankwaso stated this while speaking with reporters after inaugurating the state office of the NNPP in Gombe State. According to him, even if Obi accepts to become his vice-presidential candidate, people from his region will reject it. “Even if my friend [Peter Obi] wants to accept the vice-presidential candidate, some people in the south-east will not accept, that is not strategic. “This is a golden opportunity, if they lose it, it will be a disaster,” Kwankwaso said. Kwankwaso and Obi have been locked in talks over a possible merger or working together ahead of the 2023 general election.
