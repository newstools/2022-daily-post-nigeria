Senator Magnus Ngei Abe, Tuesday called on the Church to actively get involved in politics ahead of the 2023 general elections. He also explained that the Church is part of society and whatever happens to the society, affects the Church. Abe, who represented Rivers South-East Senatorial district at the House of Assembly made the call while addressing members of the City of David International Church, Odani, Elelenwo, a suburb of Port Harcourt, Rivers State Capital. In his words, “A lot of times people feel that the Church should not get involved in what’s going on in the society. But the Church is part of the society and ultimately, what’s happening in society affects the Church in every single way. “When members of your congregations keep having problems that they cannot get help, who will they call? When they are not able to meet up their obligations to themselves and their families where do they go to? “So, even the Church itself is helpless if we don’t work well for the people. So, part of your prayers is to have a society that works well for those who are following you to Church. That is how God will manifest himself in their lives. So, what happens in society will affect you. “If the government does not work well, it is those who live in Rivers State that will suffer it and that will include our pastors and our Church members. If society works well and people can prosper and be happy; is that not God answering our prayers? “So, the credit will still come to the Church. That is why I say that it is important for the church to get involved in what is happening in society”.
