Some members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Friday, defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ikorodu area of Lagos State. Prince Abiodun Ogunleye, a former deputy governor of Lagos State, while receiving the defectors at the APC party secretariat, assured them of equity and fairness in the ruling party. “We’ll ensure that you benefit from every opportunity regarding the welfare of members without sentiments in our party,” Ogunleye said. He admonished the defectors to get their Permanent voters Card(PVC)and vote for APC in all elective positions in 2023 general elections. Mr Olayinka Adewale, speaking on behalf of the.defectors disclosed that they defected to the APC because of internal wranglings in the PDP in Ikorodu. Adewale mentioned that the emergence of a Southerner as the presidential candidate of the ruling party also informed their defection,saying the victory of the ruling party in 2023 would not only benefit the zone but the country . “I am a delegate at the last PDP primaries and I was expecting the ticket to be zoned to the South. “Today we have taken a very important step to move to APC so that we can support the candidate of our choice,” he said.
