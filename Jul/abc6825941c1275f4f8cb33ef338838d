Four housewives and five others were on Sunday abducted at Shema Quarters in Dutsin-Ma Local Government Area of Katsina State during a heavy downpour. The assailants who were in large numbers, armed with AK-47 among other weapons, reportedly stormed the neighbourhood at about 11:30pm on Sunday and terrorized the area for about three hours before the arrival of a security team. DAILY POST gathered from the residents that the hoodlums ransacked Usman Abdullahi Yarima’s residence and abducted two of his wives along with three other members of his household and then proceeded to the residence of Abdulaziz Lawal’s and whisked away two of his wives and two other relatives. The husbands were reportedly overpowered by the hoodlums, and fled for their lives, leaving members of their household in the hands of the terrorists. Confirming the report, the spokesperson of the Katsina Police, SP Gambo Isah said: “Yes, I was informed of the attack but at the moment the information at my disposal is sketchy and will revert when I have full details.” Isah, however, noted that the Dutsin-Ma Armoured Personnel Carrier vehicles and some police officers were already drafted to the scene of the incident to engage the terrorists in a gun duel. He also debunked the allegation that the assailants terrorized the community for about three hours. “We got that report around 11pm but for them to have operated up to 2am, that one I cannot say is true,” Isah said
