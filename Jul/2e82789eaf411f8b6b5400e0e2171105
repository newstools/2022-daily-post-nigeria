Just a few days to the July 16 Osun gubernatorial election, the Osun State chapter of the Accord Party has revealed that it has uncovered plans by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to massively engage in vote buying. This revelation was contained in a statement by Stephen Owolabi, media aide to Akin Ogunbiyi, Osun Accord Party gubernatorial candidate, and obtained by DAILY POST on Sunday in Osogbo. The Accord Party claimed that going by the information at its disposal, both the APC and PDP have been engaging in buying and stockpiling of voters cards, an action which is likely to plunge the state into crisis stressed that there was a need to speak out before such would happen. The statement, which highlighted that the recent arrest of agents of the political parties and INEC officials in Ijesaland was a pointer of concern, added that the majority of electorates were yet to get their voters cards despite seeing their names on the INEC register. “The recent arrest of agents of one of the political parties and INEC officials in Ijesaland over voters cards’ buying was a pointer to our concern. “Again, we have it on good authority that the essence of a large number of the Campaign Committees by both APC and PDP was to raise enough funds for vote-buying. “For instance, as we are writing this statement, Governor Ortom of Benue state has sent five delegates fully funded to come to the state to buy over indigenes of his state residing in Osun to vote for a particular candidate. “As it is now, many agents of both the PDP and APC are moving around the wards and units inducing electorates with money while promising them more money on the election day,” the statement concluded.
