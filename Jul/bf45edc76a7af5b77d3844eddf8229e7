Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has noted that the secrecy that surrounded President Muhammadu Buhari’s health made most Nigerians believe that the story that Jibril of Sudan was in charge of the country. HURIWA said this while applauding Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo over his full disclosure on his surgery at a Lagos-based hospital. The group said this must be the way to go for politicians in the country including President Buhari and other politicians who frequent overseas on medical tourism. HURIWA’s National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko, in a statement, said “politicians must play the game by the rule and must never expect the people who own the sovereignty of Nigeria to worship them as if they are deities. DAILY POST reported that the Vice president was admitted to the Duchess International Hospital GRA, Lagos, on Saturday on account of a fracture of his right femur. “The number two citizen should be saluted over his full disclosure about his condition as opposed to the secrecy that has surrounded President Muhammadu Buhari’s frequent foreign medical tours on our public costs,” HURIWA added. “In the case of his boss, the President, the opaque and secretive nature of his frequent overseas medical trips at great costs to Nigeria even made some groups to circulate the tales by moonlight that the real Buhari was not the one in the Presidency but that a certain Jibril from Sudan was supplanted to mask as the real President Muhammadu Buhari that some 12 million voters elected twice in 2015 and 2019. “This story about President Buhari was given life by the unnecessary secrecy surrounding his health conditions. “But this refreshing attitude of full disclosure shown by the Vice President is indeed heartwarming and should be commended by all and sundry.”
