GUTS Foundation takes social vices, political sensitization to Abuja school Students of Centagon International School, Abuja were thrown into unimaginable excitement when GUTS foundation stormed the school on a sensitization tour. The visitation of the powerful team from the foundation educated the students on various issues ranging from politics, social cohesion and crimes.  Speakers aptly captured the essence of youths participation in politics in a topic that appeared to have aligned with the concept of “tomorrow’s heros” Speaking after the event attended by teachers and other stakeholders of the school, the founder of GUTS foundation, Miss Barbara Vivien Imbufe said: “The visit to the school was part of the fulfilment of our social responsibility of sensitizing the young ones. We want to redirect their paths while they are still young.  “There are issues in the country today because young people are not educated enough in key societal issues. “If we all contribute in our own little way of passing the message of hope to the young ones while at the same time educating them on what they should know, we will undoubtedly achieve a better society,” she said. The event ended with an interactive session in form of questions and answers.  Recall that GUTS foundation had engaged in different campaigns in Abuja, particularly on voters education at various communities. Recently, the foundation embarked on a tour of the nation’s capital to help residents with online registration of Permanent Voters Card, PVC.
