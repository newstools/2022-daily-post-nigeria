Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has admitted his team made mistakes in their 4-0 defeat to Manchester United in a pre-season friendly on Tuesday. United kicked off their tour of Thailand and Australia with a resounding win over their Premier League rivals. Jadon Sancho, Fred, Anthony Martial and Facundo Pellistri all scored for the Red Devils. Klopp has now claimed his team gave United “assists” for their goals. “The result is there, we have to accept it. We could have scored our goals as well and the goals we gave away were almost assists. “I saw a lot of good stuff but the game came too early. Mistakes happen in football. It was so open and it was pretty clear where we made the mistakes,” Klopp said. While United next head to Melbourne to play Melbourne Victory and Crystal Palace, Liverpool travel to Singapore, also taking on Palace.
