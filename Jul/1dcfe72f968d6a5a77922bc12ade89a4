Two prominent Nigerian socio-political activists have alleged vote-buying in the ongoing governorship election in Osun State. Shehu Sani, former Kaduna Central Senator, alleged that some residents of Osun State are reportedly demanding money before voting. He, however, warned that money would prevent the emergence of a good leader. In a tweet, Sani wrote: “The Osun residents reportedly demanded money before voting. Money is the temptation that will stand in between the electorates and their dream of a good leadership and a better country.” Similarly, Deji Adeyanju also alleged vote-buying in most polling units in the State. “Massive vote buying ongoing in most PUs in Osun. #OsunDecides2022. “ILE IFE RIGGING BEGINS: They are beating People perceived to be PDP supporters and not allowing them to vote at Ok 3, Unit 14, Ogbon Oya in Ile Ife as I predicted yesterday,” Adeyanju tweeted.
