Chelsea is concentrating on completing transfers for Raheem Sterling and Raphinha, according to Sky Sports. However, senior officials at Stamford Bridge have also discussed moves for Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar. Chelsea is already in advanced talks with Manchester City for Sterling. Sterling will cost the Blues around £50 million, while they have also reached a £60 million agreement with Leeds for Raphinha. However, Raphinha is stalling on the move, with the hope he can seal a transfer to Barcelona. The club have made it clear they will only sign players that their manager Thomas Tuchel wants.
