Former Lille defender, Jose Fonte has told new Paris Saint-Germain coach, Christophe Galtier what he must do to win the UEFA Champions League. Earlier this week, PSG announced Galtier as their new manager shortly after the French Ligue 1 champions parted ways with Mauricio Pochettino. Galtier agreed to a two-year deal at the Parc des Princes with the option of an extra year. When asked about what Galtier has to do to win the UEFA Champions League with PSG, Fonte told talkSPORT, “I think the problem is, in today’s day and age, if you have two or three players that are not running back, you are not going to win against the big teams. Because Manchester City, Liverpool, Bayern Munich, and Real Madrid do, so if you have three players not tracking back, you are going to be in trouble.” He added: “It doesn’t matter how good you are going forward, you are going to be in trouble of conceding goals. So I think he needs to get them really solid defensively because, offensively, we know what they are capable of.”
