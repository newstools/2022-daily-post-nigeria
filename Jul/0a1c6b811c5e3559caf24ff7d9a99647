Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola said the All Progressives Congress (APC) will beat the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on July 16. Both parties will go head to head in two weeks in the state’s governorship election. Oyetola visited Ila-Orangun in Ila Local Government Area on Friday. “It will take the PDP 30 years to recover from the shock it will receive due to the defeat”, he boasted. Oyetola said his eight years in power as governor “is sure with God on my side”. He advised opposition parties to prepare for governance rather than contesting. The governor, however, appealed to the electorate not to sell their vote. ”They will be going about with money, but do not be swayed by their actions.” The APC candidate further described his opponents as “opportunists”
