Haruna Musa, a 21-year-old man at Angwan Gwari Kwamba, Suleja local government area of Niger State was on Tuesdays night caught sexually abusing a mentally ill woman. A source said the suspect had not succeeded in his plans when the screams of the mentally ill woman alerted people leading to his apprehension by the police. The suspect blamed his action on drunkenness, a curse from his village and that he was lured to her by her nakedness, he was, however, found with wraps of substances believed to be Indian hemp. According to him, “If not for the security men, maybe I would have had sex with her. I don’t know what came over me. Please forgive me. I am just 21years. I had a lot of things on my mind. My problems are bigger than me. I have nobody to help me.”
If found guilty, the law stipulates life imprisonment for Musa, since a mentally unstable woman cannot give consent for sexual intercourse.
