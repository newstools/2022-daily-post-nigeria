Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has described the death of veteran actress, Ada Ameh as a monumental loss to the country, the state especially the entertainment industry. “In Ada Ameh, Benue State has lost an Amazon of inestimable value. Through her personal commitment and industry, she promoted the rich culture and tradition of the state at the global stage”, Ortom lamented. He stated that Ada’s exit has created a huge vacuum in Benue State especially in the entertainment industry adding “millions of citizens especially the movie industry enthusiasts will miss Ada because of her unique style.” A grieving Ortom added: “Her death at this time is heart rending. A lot of youngsters looked up to her as a role model and she actually mentored many.” The Governor described the Idoma-born actress as a worthy ambassador of the state who through dint of hard work and dexterity, promoted and indeed exported the culture and tradition of Benue State and Nigeria to the outside world. Ortom stated: “There were no dull moments around her during her lifetime. She radiated warmth and brought pleasantries to many homes across the globe. We shall sorely miss her”. He prayed that the good Lord grant her eternal rest and give the immediate family the fortitude to bear the irreplaceable loss.
