Immediate past Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, has said those who voted during the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential primary are regretting their decision. Amaechi said delegates who allowed money to influence their decision during the presidential primary are now regretting it. The former APC presidential aspirant spoke during the 60th birthday celebration of Apostle Eugene Ogu, General Overseer of Abundant Life Evangel Mission, over the weekend in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. He noted that throwing money around to get votes would not solve Nigeria’s problems. Amaechi also urged men of God to pray for the ordinary Nigerians to enable them elect a President that would solve the country’s problems. According to Amaechi: “Those who voted at the APC primaries, who are they? They are ordinary Nigerians. The small money they got solved their immediate problem, now they are saying they made a mistake, you are now hearing different things. “If you are praying for us, pray for the leadership of the country, but also pray for ordinary Nigerians to be able to choose the right President to govern the country. “Giving money is not the solution to Nigeria’s problem. The solution to Nigeria’s problem is that all of you must all rise.” During the APC presidential primaries in Abuja, Amaechi was beaten by the party’s flagbearer, Bola Tinubu. The former Rivers State governor came second behind Tinubu who polled the highest number of votes. Reports had it that the APC presidential primary was marred by vote-buying.
