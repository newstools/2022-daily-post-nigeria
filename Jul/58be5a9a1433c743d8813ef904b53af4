The United States has approved more than $592million in new humanitarian assistance for Africa. The intervention fund would be supervised by the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Assistant Secretary of State, Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, Julieta Valls Noyes made the announcement on Friday in Kampala, Uganda. This assistance will provide lifesaving support to refugees, asylum seekers, internally displaced persons, stateless persons and forcibly displaced. Others are persecuted people, including those affected by crises in the Horn, the Sahel, and other emergency situations. A statement by the State Department said response efforts to address under-recognized humanitarian crises are facing dire funding constraints. “This assistance will enable our humanitarian partners to help the over seven million refugees and asylum seekers currently hosted across Africa as well the over 25 million internally displaced persons,” it read. The U.S. expressed concern about the diminished global attention to humanitarian crises in Africa, including in Uganda. The American government urged other donors to provide additional support to the growing charitable needs on the continent.
