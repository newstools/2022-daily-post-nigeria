Speaking after signing the new contract with Liverpool, Salah wished Mane all the best at Bayern and Nunez to score many goals for Liverpool. The 30-year-old told Liverpool’s official website: “I am so excited, I want to play with him. He had a good season and played good against us, home and away. “Also, Sadio has left and I am going to miss him. He had great seasons with the club, so I wish him all the best. I wish Darwin all the best, too, to score many goals for us.”
