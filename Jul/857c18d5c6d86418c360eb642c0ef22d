The All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu has said he made a hard choice picking former Borno State Governor, Kashim Shettima as his running mate. Tinubu explained that he settled for Shettima because he believed he made the best choice. In a tweet, the APC presidential candidate said Nigeria was at a point where it needed a bold and pragmatic approach. “This chapter in our nation’s history demands a bold yet pragmatic approach. In selecting Senator Shettima, I have committed myself to this path. I have made the hard choice because I believe it is the best choice,” he tweeted. Tinubu had picked the former Borno State governor as his running mate despite agitations from Nigerians. Nigerians had urged Tinubu to pick a Christian as his running mate, but he opted to settle for a Muslim-Muslim ticket. On Wednesday, APC officially unveiled Shettima as Tinubu’s running mate.
