The Chairman of the Zamfara State chapter of African Democratic Congress, ADC, Hon. Kabiru Garba Gusau has announced the immediate sack of the party’s chairman, Alhaji Tukur Abubakar Bungudu and his executive members in Bungudu Local Government Area of the State for anti-party activities. He said that the party received allegations against the Bungudu Local Government chairman about romancing with the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, in the State. Garba explained that the decision became imperative considering the fact that he holds a political position, which he said was contrary to ADC constitution, saying that the party will not allow its member to receive any political appointment from another party. The chairman inaugurated the caretaker committee immediately. Those inaugurated are Hon. Yahaya Abubakar Bungudu as chairman, Mustapha Lawali vice chairman, Wadatau Lawali Gada, PRO, while Shafi’u Mande Bela would serve as secretary. He further stated that the dissolution of Bungudu ADC leadership will be a lesson to any member found liaising with another party, saying that ADC still stands on its ground that it will not enter into any merger with any party. He, however, commended the ADC leadership in Gusau and Tsafe, assuring that all necessary support from the party’s leadership would be given to all local government leaders of the party. Garba maintained that the ADC was seriously working with the youths and the women in the State to unseat the APC.
