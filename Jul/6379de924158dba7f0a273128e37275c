Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has returned to the state after spending a few days in Turkey. Wike, alongside his Abia State counterpart, Okezie Ikpeazu traveled to Turkey on a vacation and were later joined by Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde. Wike recently lost the contest for the presidential ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party to Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and the vice presidential ticket to his Delta State counterpart, Ifeanyi Okowa. He was said to have been hurt by the action of Atiku who had “ignored” him as his running mate to pick Okowa. Wike was said to have ignored emissaries by Atiku while in Turkey. He was also said to have constantly ignored calls from the former VP who had been making efforts to pacify him.
