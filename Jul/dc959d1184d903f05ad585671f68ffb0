Morocco defender, Nesryn El Chad has insisted the Atlas Lionesses must be at their best to beat a “strong” Super Falcons side in their semi-final clash at the 2022 Africa Women’s Cup of Nations on Monday (today). Reynald Pedro’s side have enjoyed a successful competition so far, winning all their matches. The North Africans will also compete at the FIFA Women’s World Cup for the first time after making it to the semis. The next task before the Atlas Lionesses is to dethrone the Super Falcons as African champions. To achieve that, they must first beat the title holders. El Chad reckoned she and her teammates must produce a strong performance to reach the final. “We will have to be rigorous and solid defensively if we want to qualify for the final, no matter who the opponent is in front of us,” El Chad told CAFonline. “We must remain strong and organised at the back. We are ready on all levels, physically, technically and tactically,” she said. The encounter is billed for the Moulay Abdellah Sports Complex, Rabat. Kick-off is 9pm Nigeria time.
