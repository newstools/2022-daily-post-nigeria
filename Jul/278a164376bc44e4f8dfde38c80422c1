Former federal lawmaker, Dino Melaye, has said despite the leadership qualities of the Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, he may need to wait for another election to run for presidency. In a video posted on his social media handles on Friday, Mr Dino said based on Peter Obi’s view of the country’s challenges, the nation does not need him for now. According to Dino, the country currently needs someone who would unify the different regions and ethnic groups in the country, not someone like Obi who only wants to cut the cost of governance. He said, “Peter Obi is one of the finest Nigerians who is intellectually mobile, he is a great Nigerian and by the grace of God, he is qualified to be a president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the nearest future. “Mr Peter Obi, I celebrate your movement for a new Nigeria, but I want to advise that your time is not now, you have to wait for your time. “I have listened to your arguments and your deliveries including your campaign but I can say that 90% of your campaign is dwelling on reducing the cost of governance. “I want to tell you that the problems of this country are beyond just cutting the cost of governance. It is less than 1% of our national problems. “What we need in this country is to unite the nation. Nigeria has never been this divided in our national history. We need one character who has the ability to unite us as a nation.”
