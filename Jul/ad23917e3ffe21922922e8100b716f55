Jimi Agbaje, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 general elections has denied defecting to the All Progressives Congress, APC. Reports emerged on Monday that Jimi had joined the ruling party to support APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, ahead of the 2023 general election. But in what appeared to be a reaction to the report on his Twitter page, Agbaje, who wrote in Yoruba, said it’s the turn of Nigerians. He noted that he is still a member of the PDP. “Eyin ko lokan o. Nigerians lokan, Jimi Agbaje – PDP. #2023NigeriaElections #2023presidency,” he wrote.
