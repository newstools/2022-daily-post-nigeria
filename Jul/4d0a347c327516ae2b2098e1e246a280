The Coalition of Southern and Middle Belt Youth Leaders Assembly, COSMBYLA, has alleged that the reintroduction of the Water Resources Bill in the House of Representatives has a hidden agenda. The Water Resources Bill, which had been thrown out by the 9th National Assembly in 2020, was on Wednesday reintroduced in the lower chamber by the Chairman of the House Committee on Water Resources, Sada Soli. The development has continued to generate reactions from stakeholders who accused President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration of plotting to deny Nigerians the right to the God-given water resources. A statement issued on Monday by the President General of COSMBYLA, Goodluck Ibem alleged that the reintroduction of the bill “is a well-calculated plot to acquire land for Fulani Jihadists. “It is a plan to advance the Fulanization and Islamization agenda of President Muhammadu Buhari”. The coalition wondered why some persons would insist on imposing a bill on Nigerians despite the hardship ravaging the entire nation “Nigerians are dying of hunger and starvation on a daily basis as a result of the high cost of food, high cost of kerosene sold at N900 per litre and diesel for N1000 per litre and the only thing they are doing is to reintroduce the obnoxious Water Resources Bill. “Can the bill put food on the table of Nigerians? The answer is no. Rather the bill can only create an opportunity for the Fulani Jihadists to kill more Nigerians in other to take their lands. “We, therefore, call on the National Assembly comprising the Senate and the Federal House of Representatives to reject the obnoxious Water Resources Bill immediately without any delay”, the statement added.
