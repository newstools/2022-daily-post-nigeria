Ukrainian officials have urged the remaining residents in the Donetsk region to evacuate to safer areas. This is because Russian forces are advancing closer to the eastern territories. “Russia has turned the entire Donetsk region into a hot spot where it is dangerous to remain for civilians. “I call on everyone to evacuate. Evacuation saves lives,” the head of the Donetsk regional military administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko said, as reported by CNN The warning followed a missile strike in Toretsk on Wednesday. Although Ukrainian forces still have the control of 45 percent of Donetsk, the Russians have shifted their focus on Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, after taking over Lysychansk in the neighboring Luhansk region. Most people have already left the city over the renewed and increased strikes according to the head of the Sloviansk military-civilian administration, Vadym Liakh.
