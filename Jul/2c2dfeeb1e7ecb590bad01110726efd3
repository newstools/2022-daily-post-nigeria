Former Manchester United and Portugal forward, Nani has revealed Cristiano Ronaldo’s response to him when he called to ask him about his future at Old Trafford. Nani, who played alongside Ronaldo in Manchester United and in the national team, said he has been trying to get in touch with his former teammate. According to Nani, whenever Ronaldo is on vacation, he does not answer the phone from anybody, adding that he tried to reach out to the former Real Madrid goal-machine but he (Ronaldo) said he was busy and promised to return the call. Ronaldo has reportedly told Manchester United to allow him leave Old Trafford this summer, but it remains to be seen whether the Portugal legend will move on. The Real Madrid legend is reportedly unhappy over the club’s failure to qualify for the Champions League next season and the way they have approached the transfer market so far. Ronaldo scored 24 times for Manchester United last season to help them qualify for the Europa League but would not want to play in Europe’s second-tier competition. Reports in Europe suggest that Manchester United are keen on making their legendary striker stay and new manager Erik ten Hag had already confirmed he is planning to work with the veteran throughout the 2022-23 season. Nani, whose Australian club, Melbourne Victory were defeated 4-1 by Manchester United in a friendly at the weekend, was asked about the speculation linking his former teammate with a summer move, Nani said: “I hope [he stays].”
