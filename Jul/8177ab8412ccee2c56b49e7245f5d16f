The Labour Party, LP, Vice Presidential candidate, has informed doubters that social media will actually vote in the forthcoming presidential election. On Friday, Baba-Ahmed was picked as running mate to the Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi. Hours later, in an interview on Channels Television’s Politics Today, he said recent data shows that Nigerians in the diaspora are already booking their flights for the election. He also said they are not scared of the moneybags, adding that their money will become very irrelevant as the election approaches. “Go and start looking at the booking of major European airlines into Nigeria not during Christmas time. Funny enough this time after Christmas time late January to the third week of February, you will see that they’re getting full unusually. “I’m into the business of data and statistics and I decided to look into that. This tells you that social media is getting to vote. “Social media, even if they’re in Canada or Antarctica, one person is there and she mobilizes a hundred thousand people here to go out and vote, it has succeeded. “But we’re not scared. The bank balance of any big politician is starting to be irrelevant. Those of us who sweated for the little that we have, we’re spending it very wisely and very carefully.”
