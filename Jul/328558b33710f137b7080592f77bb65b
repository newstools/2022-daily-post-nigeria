President Muhammadu Buhari has commiserated with the family of frontline politician and advocate of the womenfolk, Kemi Nelson. The 66-year-old All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain died on Sunday. The President, on behalf of his wife, also sent condolences to the government and people of Lagos, APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, and the party. Buhari described Nelson as a “faithful party member who devoted so much to the evolution, development, sustenance and relevance of the party in Lagos and around the country”. He noted her contributions as Commissioner for Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation in Lagos, Woman Leader, APC National Deputy Women Leader, and ex-Executive Director of the Nigerian Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF). Buhari said she was such a grassroots mobiliser and an achiever who left her footprints wherever she served. “As the only female member of the Lagos State Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC), Kemi Nelson continued to be part of the governance structure that led to the transformation of Lagos State into the Centre of Excellence it has become,” he said. The President prayed that almighty God will grant the husband, Adeyemi Nelson, and the family, friends, and associates the fortitude to bear the loss.
