The Campaign Council of Governor Gboyega Oyetola’s re-election has warned the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) not to set the State on fire by allegedly claiming to win the Saturday gubernatorial election. The Director-General of the Campaign Council of Governor Gboyega Oyetola’s re-election, Senator Ajibola Basiru gave the warning in a statement on Saturday evening. Basiru said the claim by the PDP was capable of setting Osun on fire. He equally called on the security agencies to take appropriate action in dealing decisively “with the peddlers of this false claim as they are setting the stage for violence and chaos.” According to him, “Going by the result so far declared, there was no way PDP could lay claim to any victory. “Therefore, the PDP’s claim is tantamount to standing logic on its head. We appeal to our supporters and sympathisers in Osun and across the country to remain calm in the face of this obvious provocation.”
