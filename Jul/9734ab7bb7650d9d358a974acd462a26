The Labour Party presidential candidate, Mr Peter Obi has revealed that if elected as president of the country in 2023, he would engage in dialogue with those agitating for secession. Speaking on Arise TV morning show on Wednesday, Obi said he had observed how issues of agitations were handled in other countries. According to him, the agitation was birthed by poor leadership in the country which, according to him, had been the issue with Nigeria over the years. Clearing the air on his reported support for the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, the former Anambra State governor said he had never been involved in any agitation. He said, “I have never been in any agitation. I had said that the agitation is because of leadership failure over the years. I will engage them in dialogue if elected into power”.
