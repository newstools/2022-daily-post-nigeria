The Amadaowei of Adagbabiri Community in Sagbama Local Government Area of Bayelsa State, HRH Alaowei Okee, has petitioned the state Commissioner of Police, Ben Okolo, over the unlawful activities of suspected crude oil thieves in his domain, alleging that his refusal to agree with the shady activities has led to threats to his life. The Paramount ruler, who also denied abandoning his throne and community due to the alleged threats from sponsors of the illegal oil thieves, said he was duly elected by his people and gazetted by the State Government of which he receives their total support not to allow such nefarious and dangerous activities in his domain. HRH Alaowei Okee, while speaking with newsmen in Yenagoa, said the suspected members of the illegal oil theft syndicate approached him to allow them set up an illegal oil bunkering site in the area and offered to pay him some amount monthly but he refused. He alleged, “They approached me about two months ago in my palace and sought my cooperation with them to use my community as a base for their illegal bunkering activities, and even offered to pay me N200, 000 per truck of oil offloaded from the community’s waterfront but I refused to oblige their request”. He explained that he refused their offer because apart from the financial benefits offered him, the community would suffer serious environmental degradation and pollution; attract hoodlums with resultant cult clashes and unnecessary gun-running activities that would bring about other security breaches as it is in communities where such illegal activity takes place. “To my chagrin, I discovered that the illegal oil activities were conceived despite my objections. At this junction, I would want to correct other reports going on this matter. I first put a call through to the Deputy Governor and when he was unreachable I quickly reported to the State Commissioner of Police, Commandant of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defense Corps and the Nigerian Navy” ” I never for once got through to the state’s Deputy Governor, Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo where he promised to relieve the appointees of their appointments if they are found culpable in the illegal trade” as reported in the media” Okee said since he raised the alarm, he has received multiple calls from the accused political appointee and unknown callers threatening to snuff life out of him,”. ”They have rained insults and other threats on me and I, therefore, want all concerned authorities to wade into this matter to bring the perpetrators to book as a switch in time saves nine”.
