Iba Gani Adams, the Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, has warned that Nigeria might cease to exist in the next two years going by the plethora of crisis in the country. He maintained that government’s urgent implementation of true federalism was the only way to save the nation from going off the rails. The country’s governance has exhibited a lack of coordination, according to the Generalissimo of the Yoruba race, despite the insecurity situation, the economic downturn, and deteriorated institutions, among other things. The Odua People’s Congress, OPC, leader Adams said this at this year’s Okota celebration in his hometown of Arigidi-Akoko, in Ondo State’s Akoko North-West Local Government Area. He emphasized that the country’s ongoing problems would only get worse as a result of the drive to adapt Nigeria to a unitary system of government. “With the insecurity issues in Nigeria, there is nothing that can be done if we do not have federalism. If we do not allow federalism on the basis of regionalism, I’m afraid within two years, this country will break. “You can see how the wave is coming. Not only wave of insecurity, even the economy, depreciating of institution, lack of coercion in governance. Definitely, there is danger ahead if the Nigerian government did not act fast to restructure Nigeria to regionalism.”
