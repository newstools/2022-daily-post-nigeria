The United States Mission to Nigeria has congratulated the citizens of Osun State. A statement by the consulate on Monday commended the July 16 “peaceful gubernatorial elections”. It hailed the concerted efforts of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) staff and security personnel. The US noted that their conduct helped facilitate a secure process that reflected the will of the people. “We encourage all Nigerian citizens to register to vote now so that your voice can be heard in the national and state elections in 2023”, the statement reads. Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) defeated Governor Gboyega Oyetola of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).
