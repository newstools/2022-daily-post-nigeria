Ukraine has been accused of launching missiles into the territory of Belarus. President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus said that Ukraine fired missiles at military facilities on his country’s territory, but was grateful to God that his military air defence neutralised them. Lukashenko said that Ukraine’s missiles were intercepted by his country’s air defense systems earlier this week, CNN reports. Lukashenko is a close ally of President Vladimir Putin of Russia. He described Ukraine’s action as “provocation” according to the statement published by state-run news agency Belta. “Thank God, the Pantsir anti-aircraft systems managed to intercept all the missiles launched by the Armed Forces of Ukraine,” he said. The Ukrainian military did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Lukashenko’s claims, according to CNN.
