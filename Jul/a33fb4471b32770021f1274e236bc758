R.Kelly has been taken off suicide watch following a face-off with federal authorities in the US. The singer had filed the lawsuit against the prison he was kept in after being convicted for sex crimes. Kelly claimed he was being subjected to “cruel and unusual punishment” which violates his 8th Amendment rights, after he was put on suicide watch at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center. He insisted that he wasn’t even thinking of killing himself and claimed he was placed in these harsh conditions because he is a celebrity. However, the Metropolitan Detention Center Warden Heriberto H. Tellez, who was named as one of the defendants in the lawsuit, told TMZ that he has taken a decision to remove Kelly from suicide watch following a “clinical assessment.” No further details on the assessment were provided. Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison last Wednesday following his conviction last year on federal racketeering and sex trafficking charges.
