Manchester City forward, Raheem Sterling has started the process of selling his house to another Premier League star as he prepares to move to West London. Liverpool defender Trent Alexander Arnold is in negotiation to buy the Manchester City star’s house located in the Cheshire countryside. The house is said to be worth around £4.5 million. Liverpool star, Alexander Arnold currently lives in South Manchester on the same road as teammate and Brazilian goalkeeper, Alisson Becker and former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba. Chelsea are interested in signing Sterling this summer after manager Thomas Tuchel expressed his wish to work with the England international. It has been reported that a £45 million deal is ‘well advanced’, with the two clubs hoping for an agreement to be reached as soon as possible. The 27-year-old England international is seeking a move from the Etihad Stadium in order to secure his place in the England squad ahead of the Qatar 2022 World Cup.
