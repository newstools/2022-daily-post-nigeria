Bola Tinubu, the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, has called on relevant authorities to go after Tuesday’s attackers of Kuje Medium Security Custodial Centre in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Tinubu who is also one of the leaders of the APC, made the call in a statement by his Media Officer, Mr Tunde Rahman, in Abuja. He particularly condemned the terrorist attack on the centre, saying the incessant terror attacks plaguing the country was worrisome. The former two-term Lagos State governor, while calling on Nigerians to remain vigilant and united behind constituted authorities, said fleeing inmates from the facility must be re-arrested and returned to the facility. “These incessant attacks on government’s institutions and innocent citizens are a sad reminder that we still have a lot to do to put these evil forces in check.” He condemned the dastardly attack, urging the government to immediately go after the attackers and fleeing inmates of the facility. While calling for full investigations of the incident, Tinubu said Nigerians must all remain vigilant and united. He added that the moment called for national unity and deep introspection. He, however, said Nigerians should continue to support President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration in its battle against insurgents and determination to confront agents of darkness. He commiserated with families and relations of those who lost their lives in the attack and called on the government to continue to provide succour and medical attention to those injured.
