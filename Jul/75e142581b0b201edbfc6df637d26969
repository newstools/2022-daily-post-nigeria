The State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Kaduna State, Felix Hassan Hyatt and the entire State Executive Committee of the party on Saturday, congratulated the Muslim Ummah across the state and beyond, on the celebration of this year’s Eid-el-Kabir. Abraham Alberah Catoh, State Publicity Secretary of the party, in a statement, called on Muslims to use the Sallah period to pray for the release of all kidnapped victims and for peace to return to the country. He said the PDP urged all citizens to continue to be law-abiding and never be deterred, even in the face of the impunity, insecurity and economic challenges they are faced with, due to the misgovernance of the Nasir El-Rufai led-APC government in Kaduna State. He said the party used the opportunity to reawaken all citizens, who are yet to register for their Permanent Voters Card (PVC), as a matter of civic responsibility, do so within the extension of registration by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, so as to be able to vote the repressive, brutish and inept APC government out of power in the 2023 general elections. The party reassured all citizens of her commitment to the rule of law, good governance and respect for citizens’ rights as enshrined in our country’s Constitution. Happy Eid-el-Kabir celebration, once again
