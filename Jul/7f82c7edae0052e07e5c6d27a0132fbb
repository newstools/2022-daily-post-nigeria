Former Aston Villa captain, Gabriel Agbonlahor, has hit out at Manchester United forward Cristiano Ronaldo, insisting that the five-time Ballon d’Or winner only cares about himself and not the Red Devils. Ronaldo reportedly asked Man United last weekend to allow him leave if a reasonable offer is made for his services this summer. Despite having 12 months remaining on his current deal, the Portugal captain is seemingly unsettled at Old Trafford after Man United failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League last season. His agent, Jorge Mendes, has held talks with a host of clubs, including Chelsea, Bayern Munich, AS Roma and Barcelona, over a potential move for his client. Speaking on talkSPORT, Agbonlahor claimed that Man United need Ronaldo now more than ever, but the 37-year-old wants to jump ship. The former England international said, “I’m not surprised one bit, he [Ronaldo] doesn’t want to play in the Europa League. In the last few years of his career, he wants to play in the Champions League. “But if I was a Manchester United fan, the biggest disappointment would be that he doesn’t care about Manchester United, he cares about Ronaldo. “He wants to play in the Champions League, he wants to score more UCL goals, he wants to win more titles. United are a million miles away from any of that. He just cares about himself, he doesn’t care about United because they need him now and he wants to jump ship. “He doesn’t want to be there and it just shows that it’s the Ronaldo show and not the United show.”
