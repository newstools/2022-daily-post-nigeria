Nigeria will not play in the final of this year’s Women’s Africa Cup of Nations, after losing 5-4 on penalties to Morocco. The Super Falcons were chasing a record-extending 10th title coming into the semi-final clash, but would have to wait longer to achieve it. Randy Waldrum’s ladies were reduced to 10 men, after Halimatu Ayinde was shown a straight card for a stamp following a VAR review. However, Uchenna Kanu gave Nigeria the lead, reacting fastest to a rebound inside the box. The hosts levelled 10 minutes later after Chiamaka Nnadozie flapped at a cross and Sanaa Mssoudy tucked home the loose ball. Rasheedat Ajibade was also sent off for the Falcons after another VAR review. During the shoot-out, Onumonu was the only player that missed her penalty, as Morocco booked their place in the final against South Africa.
