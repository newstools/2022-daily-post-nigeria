A Catholic cleric in Chikun, Kaduna State, Dr. Moses Bonugada has raised an alarm over bandits’ persistent attacks on clerics in the State. He specifically expressed pains over the abduction of two Catholic Priests on Friday, July 15, 2022. Bonugada, while speaking with DAILYPOST in Kaduna, on Saturday, expressed worries over the increased attack on Catholic priests in the State for the past six months. According to him, the Christian body and their leaders are peaceful, wondering why bandits have continued to beam their searchlights on Catholic priests. “Gunmen suspected to be bandits, terrorising innocent people in Kaduna State, have now beamed their searchlights on religious leaders, especially, Chistian leaders and some few individuals in the State. “There had been an attack across the three Senatorial Districts that make up 23 Local Government Areas of the State in the past, but recent happenings showed that Christian religion leaders are mostly affected,” he said. He recalled that on February 6, 2022, a Catholic priest in Kafanchan Diocese, Reverend Father Joseph Shekari was abducted from his residence at Ikulu Fari in Chawai village of Kauru Local Government Area of Kaduna. “On March 8, 2022, Reverend Father Joseph Bako, pastoral residence of Saint John’s Catholic Church, Kudenda in Chikun LGA, was killed by his abductors after collecting an undisclosed ransom. “On June 25, 2022, Reverend Father Vitus Borogo, also a Catholic priest, was killed in his farm in Kujama by armed bandits. “Also, on July 4, 2022, bandits, in the early hours of that very Monday, abducted Reverend Father Emmanuel Silas of the St. Charles Catholic Church, Zambina, in the Kauru Local Government Area of Kaduna State,” he further revealed. He called on all religions leaders to pray against the evil trying to bring division in the State, just as he pleaded with the State government to put measures in place, in order to stop the ugly happenings.
