French star Tiemoue Bakayoko is finally set to leave Chelsea after five years at the club. The midfielder has agreed a deal with French Ligue1 side Marseille this summer. The 27-year-old was a huge signing for Chelsea back in 2017 when he joined from Monaco for £40m. However, his stay at Stamford Bridge did not go as expected as things did not work out for the France international. The Frenchman made 43 appearances for the Blues across all competitions, scoring three goals and winning the FA Cup. Things fell apart for him at the club and he has not played for Chelsea since the 2017/18 season, instead moving out on a string of loans. He has played on loan at AC Milan, Monaco, Napoli, and then again at AC Milan, where he won the Serie A title in the last campaign. French publication Foot Mercato reports that he is now likely to make a permanent move away from West London He has also agreed a deal with Marseille.
