The Yoruba socio-political organization, Afenifere, has described the directive by President Muhammadu Buhari to the Nigerian Army to confront “terrorists, insurgents and wipe them off the face of the earth and bring peace to our country” as a repetition of orders. Afenifere said Buhari’s repetition of orders no longer evokes substance because it was not backed up with necessary wherewithal. The spokesman of the organization, Jare Ajayi, said the Federal Government was not working on how to wipe out terrorists despite the order. Ajayi said insurgency ought not to have occurred at all in the first place were the government up to its responsibility. He stated this in a statement titled: “Buhari’s charge to the Army to wipe terrorists, FG is not working on how this can be achieved.” The statement reads partly: “And since it began, the kid-glove treatment being meted out to the terrorists was what made them to grow to the point of taking over territories in some states in the northern part of the country, notably Sokoto, Kaduna, Borno, Niger, Zamfara among others.” While appreciating President Buhari’s affirmation to give the military needed support, Ajayi submitted that this has been said “several times over without backing it up with action.”
