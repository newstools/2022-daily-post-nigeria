The Conference of Nigerian Political Parties (CNPP) has called on the leaderships of the Nigerian Labour Congress, NLC, and the Trade Union Congress, TUC, to resign their positions and become partisan politicians. In a statement signed by the Cross River State chairman of CNPP, Paddy Allly, he said the two leaderships seem to have lost sight of their main responsibilities and delved into political partisanship. Few days ago, the organised Labour in Cross River State passed a vote of no confidence in Ambassador Ogar Osim, accusing him of autocratic leadership, hoarding information about political processes regarding Labour Party candidates for next year’s elections. Findings showed that they even conducted and unveiled a governorship candidate, which national headquarters of LP and the INEC have rejected. In the statement, CNPP confirmed Ambassador Ogar Osim as chairman of LP in the State and that of IPAC, affirming confidence in him. They accused the Organized Labour in the State of abandoning their core mandate. “The Organised Labour has the duties of ensuring that all retirees’ pensions and gratuities are paid to them, workers are promoted as and when due, ensuring prompt payments of leave grants and general welfare of members. But they have abandoned those tasks. “The Organized Labour further exposed their ignorance by alleging that their body conducted primaries for the forthcoming general elections, but INEC refused to honour the list of their own candidates. “When has Organized Labour suddenly become a political party in Nigeria? “If the leadership of the Organized Labour in Cross River is bereft of ideas that will add value to the well-being of its members, they are free
to resign and become partisan,” it stated.
