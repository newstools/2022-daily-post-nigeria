Human rights activist and co-convener of the #BringBackOurGirls Movement, Aisha Yesufu has said many Nigerians were not ready for good governance. Tracing the reason for her assertion, Yesufu said tribal biases, politics and religion are to blame. She claimed the desire for good governance and accountability is not as strong as people’s political, religious and tribal biases. She disclosed this in a tweet on Monday. Yesufu tweeted, “Honestly, many Nigerians are not yet ready for good leadership. Their political, religious, tribal biases are still stronger than the desire for good governance, accountability and transparency in Nigeria.” In another tweet, the activist called on Nigerians to focus on electing competent people with character and capacity as lawmakers. In her words, “Unless we also focus on the legislative arm of government and ensure that competent people with character and capacity and are also courageous are the ones voted into the National Assembly and state houses of Assemblies we will keep saying the previous administration is better.”
