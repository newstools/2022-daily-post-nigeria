Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel’s final decision on signing Neymar from Paris Saint-Germain has been revealed. The German boss is not enthused by the prospect of the club bringing in the Brazilian this summer. Despite PSG’s new boss saying otherwise, the French side are open to letting the 30-year-old leave this summer. However, it would be difficult for the Brazil international to leave the French capital club due to his annual salary of €43 million (£36.4m) before bonuses. Chelsea are among the small number of clubs who could potentially afford to sign the Brazil international and the club’s new co-owner, Todd Boehly, has held talks about possibility. Evening Standard reports that Tuchel is ‘lukewarm’ to the idea of having Neymar in his squad. However, it’s also said that Tuchel’s stance on Neymar, who he’s already managed at PSG, could change later in the window if Chelsea struggle to bolster their attack.
