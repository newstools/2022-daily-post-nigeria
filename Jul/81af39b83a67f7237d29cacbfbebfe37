Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has taken a swipe at Manchester United after the Reds landed in Bangkok on Sunday. Liverpool received a warm welcome when they landed in the Thai capital for the start of their pre-season tour. The crowd gathered at the airport and the tean’s hotel to catch a glimpse of their favourite players. Addressing the media after the squad landed, Klopp said: “First question I have…did it look like this yesterday when Manchester(United) was here as well?” And the crowd replied with: “No!No.”, in fairness, Erik ten Hag and his team of players and management also received a hugely warm welcome on their arrival in Bangkok on Saturday. Manchester United and Liverpool play their first pre-season game against each other on Tuesday. Klopp further spoke about the prospect of playing Manchester United under their new manager Erik ten Hag. “Manchester United. New manager. Trained a little bit longer than us. Not sure, but might be in a better situation at the moment,” Klopp said, adding that the game on Tuesday is an important one for Liverpool because it’s against United. And, according to him, they are not going to handle it as a friendly match.
