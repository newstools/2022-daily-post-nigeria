Former Arsenal midfielder, Jack Wilshere, is set to seal an official return to the Gunners as the club’s new Under-18s head coach. The Athletic report that Arsenal are to hire Wilshere as former Under-18 coach Dan Micciche’s successor. Arsenal are also finalising the replacement for Kevin Betsy, who left his role as Under-23 manager to join Crawley Town, with U23 assistant Mehmet Ali set to be promoted to head coach of that side. The move means Wilshere returns to the same academy he graduated from as a 16-year-old to make his senior debut back in 2008. Earlier on Friday, Wilshere announced his retirement from professional football at the age of just 30. The former England international was training with Arsenal and earning his coaching badges last year, before sealing a move to Danish side AGF. But he has now decided to hang up his boots for good after a career filled with numerous injuries.
