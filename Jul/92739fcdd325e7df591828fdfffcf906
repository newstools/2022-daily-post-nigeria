Orji said: “She will pack them, go to their house and warm it for herself, siblings and grandparents. “We were touched and contributions started. We donated huge amount of money and bought foodstuffs for her. “We acquired bags of rice, beans, indomie, crayfish, onions, egusi, Custard, sugar, Beverages, yam, groundnut oil, Red oil, bag of garri, Toothbrushes and pastes, Spaghetti, and other numerus things. “They’re living in poverty. We also gave them a cash of N20,000.” “We discovered that the four kids are out of school children for a very long time now due to lack of funds. I have decided to pay the girl’s school fees from primary 3 to Primary 6. “We noticed that the remaining siblings are also out of school and I informed my course mates. As we speak, they have decided to pay the children’s fees till primary 6,” he narrated.
