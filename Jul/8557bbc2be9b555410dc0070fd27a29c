Recall that Edochie caused controversy online after he embraced polygamy, announcing the birth of his son with his second wife. The actor and his second wife, Judy Austin worked together on several movies which brought their attention to Nigerians. His decision was widely criticised, however, the actor cum politician insisted that his first wife still remains number one. Speaking on Facebook live, May disclosed that her decision to dwell on pieces of her once happy marriage and support from family and friends saved her from being depressed. She said: “I saw some comments saying I’m using my situation to cash out but I don’t wish this upon my enemies if at all I have any. “Depression is real and there are different stages, for me rather than dwell in depression I decided to pick up pieces of a beautiful world I had that suddenly shattered. “I decided to pick up the pieces and try to move on than dwell in depression. It has not been easy but I’m glad I am able to go out and do stuff. “All the things I’m able to do is because of the love from my family and you guys. These things have kept me going.”
