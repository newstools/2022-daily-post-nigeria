Kano State Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has said that the appointment of Umar El-Yakub as the Minister of State for Works and Housing by President Muhammadu Buhari has restrengthened the APC in Kano. The State Commissioner for Information, Malam Muhammad Garba in a statement said Governor Ganduje hailed the president for appointing a stalwart of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and worthy son of Kano given his sterling performances as a lawmaker and most recently a Presidential aide. He said the appointment of a long-standing member of the progressive family equipped with political experience and knowledge, is a good omen for the development of the state and the progress of the APC in Kano State. The governor expressed confidence in the ability of the new minister to further consolidate on his pedigree which earned him recognition, respect and honour in both the state and the nation at large. Ganduje also enjoined him to see the new task as a challenge to make more remarkable impacts by deploying his vast experience, network and depth of knowledge to help in repositioning the sector in line with President Muhammadu Buhari’s agenda for housing and infrastructure development in the country. El-Yakub, who was a member of the House of Representatives in 1988, 2003-2007 for Kano Municipal, was until his ministerial appointment a Senior Special Assistant (SSA) to the President on National Assembly Matters (House of Representatives). The statement added that El-Yakub’s position as an experienced legislator has played a leading role in ensuring a harmonious working relationship between the Executive and the Legislative arm of government.
