Brigadier General Mohammed Fadah, Director-General of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), has issued a stern warning to corps members against drug abuse and other related offences. The DG gave the warning on Sunday while addressing corps members deployed to Yobe State at the Permanent Orientation Camp in Dazigau, Nangere Local Government Area of Yobe State. He reminded them that, “The orientation camp is like a semi regimented environment, please, conduct yourselves in an orderly manner and be good ambassadors of the scheme”. Brig. Gen. Fadah also added that the NYSC scheme has zero tolerance for cultism while admonishing them to also shun misuse of social media. “Avoid night journeys, unnecessary seeking for lifts and joining vehicles at unofficial designated parks”, he warned.

She informed the visiting NYSC boss that in Yobe State a total of 1,185 corps members have been registered for the orientation course.
