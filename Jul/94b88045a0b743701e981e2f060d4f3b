Chelsea is set to miss out on Sevilla’s Jules Kounde after the defender agreed on personal terms with Barcelona over a move to the Camp Nou. Kounde has been Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel’s top transfer target in the past few months. Chelsea agreed on terms with Kounde last summer, only for the deal to collapse as Sevilla played hardball over a fee. Kounde was desperate to join Chelsea last summer, but the Blues refused to activate a £67m release clause in his contract, which was Sevilla’s asking price. Chelsea has been linked with the 23-year-old this summer, particularly after the departures of Andreas Christensen and Antonio Rudiger to Barcelona and Real Madrid, respectively. However, according to Gerard Romero, the Blaugrana have now won the race for Kounde too. It is claimed the Frenchman has agreed to a salary and contract with Barcelona and all that remains is for the Catalan club to agree on a fee with Sevilla. Barcelona’s financial problems mean they can’t activate Kounde’s release clause, but they will attempt to include a player to bring down the price. Xavi’s side could offer Memphis Depay to Sevilla, with the club in need of an attacker after Anthony Martial’s departure back to Manchester United.
