Nigerian businessman Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed was on Friday announced as the running mate to Peter Obi. Obi, a former Anambra governor, is the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) for the 2023 election. Baba-Ahmed, from Kaduna State, is the founder of Baze University in Abuja, the nation’s capital. Since the emergence of Datti’s name as Obi’s running mate in the last 24 hours, different ages of the politician have been circulating. Baba-Ahmed’s date of birth was not found on his university’s profile page. “Sen. Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed is a 46-year-old Academician, Businessman and Nigerian politician”, the first line reads. Also on Wikipedia, the economist is said to have been born in “1975 or 1976”. “He was born to the Baba-Ahmed family in Zaria in the 1970s”, the ‘Early life and education’ section notes. The discrepancy has elicited reactions and questions on and off social media. LP opponents and critics are propagating the argument amid the growing confusion. Other followers of the 2023 political season are wondering if Baba-Ahmed is actually below 50 years old. They say with Peter Obi’s age (July 19, 1961) in full glare, that of his vice should not be in doubt. After findings, DAILY POST gathered that Baba-Ahmed is 53 years old. “He was born July 7, 1969”, a family source revealed on Friday. Baba-Ahmed is expected to make a clarification as he joins a presidential race witnessing controversy over candidates’ age and academic records. The LP vice presidential candidate was the Senator for Kaduna North from 2011 to 2012. He represented the Zaria federal constituency in the House of Representatives between 2003 and 2007. The former lawmaker earlier worked at the Nigerian Security Printing and Minting Company and First Bank of Nigeria. Baba-Ahmed obtained four degrees: B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Economics (University of Maiduguri); MBA (University of Wales); Ph.D. (University of Westminster).
