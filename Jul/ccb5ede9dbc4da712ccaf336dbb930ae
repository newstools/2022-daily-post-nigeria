Former Anambra Governor, Peter Obi has congratulated Osun governor-elect, Ademola Adeleke. The Labour Party (LP) presidential flagbearer issued a statement on Sunday night. Obi also hailed LP candidate, Yusuf Lasun and his running mate, Adeola Atanda, for a hard fought battle and their spirit of sportsmanship. The politician told the “Obidient Movement” and admirers nationwide that outcome “is not a verdict on our exponentially growing strength”. Obi noted that the movement is barely one month old in the party “and we had to contend with forces that have been entrenched in the state for the last two decades”. He said within a short period, the LP has made its presence and political impact felt nationally. “We must strengthen our collective resolve not relent in our noble march to take back our country”, the statement reads. Admitting that much work remained to be done, Obi charged supporters to focus the totality of efforts on the 2023 general elections. The presidential candidate said with time, the message of rescue and recovery will resonate throughout Nigeria. “Most electorate will buy into our mission to take back Nigeria, for the purpose of rescuing it from decline, shifting the psyche from consumption to production, and sharing of dwindling resources”, he added.
