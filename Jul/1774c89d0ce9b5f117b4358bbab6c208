The police in Edo on Wednesday rescued Godwin Aigbogun, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Aigbogun is the party chairman in ward 9 Orhionmwon Local Government Area of Edo. A statement by Deputy Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Jennifer Iwegbu confirmed his release. The politician was kidnapped on Wednesday on his way back from a farm in Ologbo-unu. Commissioner of Police, Abutu Yaro directed operatives of the crack team and the Anti-Kidnap and Cyber Crime Unit to free him. Iwegbu said the kidnappers, noticing they were being trailed, “succumbed to pressure and abandoned their victim unhurt and escaped into the bush”. Yaro warned kidnappers and their sponsors to either leave the state or face the wrath of the law. The police advised residents to collaborate with the security agency by providing credible and timely information on criminals.
