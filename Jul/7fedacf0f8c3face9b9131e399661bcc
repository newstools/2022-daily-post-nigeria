Manchester United midfielder, Bruno Fernandes, has welcomed the arrival of Christian Eriksen at Old Trafford and believes the midfielder ‘has been an amazing player’. Eriksen, who impressed during the second half of last season on loan at Brentford, joined Man United earlier this month as a free agent. The 30-year-old Denmark international signed a three-year deal with Man United and Fernandes said he is looking forward to learning from the former Tottenham Hotspur star. “Obviously, I always learn from players who play similar positions as me,” Fernandes said when asked about Eriksen’s arrival, as quoted by Metro UK. “I think Christian has been an amazing player in the past and even last season when he played for Brentford, he was amazing for them. “He’s such a good quality player for us and I’m looking forward to playing alongside him. “I think the best players make you play better, make you improve, so I’m looking forward to learning from him and to helping him in any way I can.”
