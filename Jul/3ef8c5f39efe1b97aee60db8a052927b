The leadership of the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) has warned Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State to immediately disband his Ebubeagu security outfit immediately. MASSOB gave the warning after reports have it that operatives of Ebubeagu security outfit had killed the seven youths in Otulu, Oru East Local Government Area of Imo State while returning from a traditional wedding in Awomama. In a statement by its leader, Uchenna Madu, MASSOB said it will take the activities of Ebubeagu in Biafra land as a declaration of internal war if Uzodinma doesn’t act now by disbanding the security outfit. MASSOB’s statement read in part, “Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) has strongly condemned the insensitive and atrocious murdering of innocent and defenceless youths from Otulu town returning from traditional marriage by Ebubeagu security outfit established by Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo state. “This killing of innocent citizens is one of the several, uncountable and secret killings of our people by Gov Hope Uzodinma” backed Ebubeagu. They are primarily established as a witch-hunting outfit to fight political enemies and nonviolent pro-Biafra agitators. “MASSOB described the Ebubeagu security outfit as a Dracula evil and agents of death established by the Imo state government. “MASSOB warns Governor Hope Uzodinma to immediately disband his Ebubeagu security outfit now or we shall see their activities in Biafra land as a declaration of internal war. The so-called Ebubeagu security outfit must cease their operation in Imo state now.”
