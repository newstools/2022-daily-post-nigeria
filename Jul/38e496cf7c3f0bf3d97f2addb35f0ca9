Rabiu Kwankwaso, the presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP, has reportedly picked Pastor Bishop Isaac Idahosa as his running mate. The party disclosed this via a tweet on Thursday that read: “Our VP Pastor Bishop Isaac Idahosa from Edo State.” Bishop Idahosa, who hails from Edo State is the Senior Pastor of God First Ministry, a.k.a Illumination Assembly. The church has its headquarters in Lekki, Lagos State. Idahosa’s emergence as Kwankwaso’s running mate followed the inability of NNPP to form an alliance with the Labour Party, presidential candidate, Peter Obi. Kwankwaso and Obi had disagreed over who would become a running mate to the other during talks, hence the fallout. However, a socio-political activist, Deji Adeyanju, has claimed that Kwankwaso picked a weak running mate in Idahosa. In a tweet, Adeyanju said Idahosa can’t deliver his ward to Kwankwaso during the 2023 elections. He stressed that Kwankwaso can’t win the 2023 presidential election. “Kwankwaso’s VP pick is too weak. His VP candidate can’t deliver his Ward to the ticket. Kwankwaso cannot win,” he tweeted.
