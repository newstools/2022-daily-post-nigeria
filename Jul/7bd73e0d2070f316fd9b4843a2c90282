Juventus defender, Matthijs de Ligt, has offered a seven-word message to a fan on Chelsea transfer rumours. De Ligt has been linked with a move away from Juventus to Chelsea this summer. The Netherlands international is currently on holiday in Greece and was approached by a Chelsea fan asking him regarding the possibility of joining Chelsea. As claimed by Football London, De Ligt came up with a cryptic reply. The 22-year-old said: “I do not know, we will see!” Meanwhile, Chelsea are keen to sign a new centre-back following the departure of Antonio Rudiger to Real Madrid last month.
