New Barcelona striker, Robert Lewandowski, has opened up on his move from Bayern Munich. According to him, he pushed to join Barca because he wanted to play in a different league. Both clubs have agreed a €45 million fee for the 33-year-old, who was into the final year of his contract at the Allianz Arena. Lewandowski will now bring an end to his eight-year stint with Bayern. “I wanted to play in a different league than the Bundesliga, this decision had been made for me for a long time. “But I have to emphasise: It was the most difficult decision of my life. “I wanted to live somewhere else again, to discover something new with my family,” he told Bild.
