The General Overseer of the Champions Royal Assembly, Prophet Joshua Iginla, has reacted to the Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Prophet Iginla said the APC Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket is a “sign of war.” The APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, had picked Borno State Senator, Kashim Shettima as his running mate. While Tinubu is a Muslim from the Southern part of the country, Shettima is a Muslim from the north. Tinubu’s choice was contrary to calls by Nigerians who had clamoured for a Christian running mate. Reacting, Iginla described Tinubu’s decision as insensitive. Addressing his church members in Abuja, Iginla said: “I asked myself, in a country like Nigeria with too much strong religious beliefs, why will the ruling party go for a Muslim-Muslim ticket? Why will their presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, go with that view? I asked myself again if we don’t know, we are sounding the drum of war in a place where there is unity, peace, and understanding despite our differences. Nigeria is a country for all and does not belong to a particular set of religion. It has never happened before in this country. Why now? “If we must make Nigeria great, we must allow equity, justice and sensitivity to be the watch of the day for our leaders. I am pleading in my heart; this was not the Nigeria I was born to. This was not the Nigeria that our great heroes fought for. What is going on? Our leaders, please save us because the Muslim-Muslim ticket is a sign of war”.
