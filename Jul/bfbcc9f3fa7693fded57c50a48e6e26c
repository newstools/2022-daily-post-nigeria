Liverpool has received a £19.5m bid from Juventus for their forward, Roberto Firmino. Fermino has just one year left on his contract with Liverpool. Liverpool could be prepared to let the Brazilian leave now rather than lose him for free next year. However, according to TuttoJuve, the Serie A giants would like to sign Fermino as they seek to improve their frontline ahead of next season. Firmino has scored 98 goals for the Reds since joining the Anfield club in 2015.
