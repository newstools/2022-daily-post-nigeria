A group of sympathisers across Etsako in Edo State have made donations to the family of the slain vigilante chairman, killed by herdsmen alongside a Priest of St Micheal Catholic Church, Rev Fr. Christopher Odia a fortnight ago. Recall that upon the kidnap of Rev Father Odia in Ikabigbo, Uzairue, Etsako West Local Government Area of Edo State, Nurudeen Yusuf was said to have mobilised his men to lead the search of the cleric but lost his life in the process. The vigilante Chairman, a muslim fell to the bullet of the criminals on June 26, 2022, by the kidnappers who first abducted Rev. Fr. Christopher Odia. Leader of the Etsako group, Patrick Inobemhe who presented the donation when he visited the village to commiserate with the affected families, described the attack as “unfortunate and dastardly.” “Attention of both local and international community have been drawn to the death of the catholic priest without anyone saying anything about the vigilante chairman who died while defending his community and the priest despite being a Muslim. “This is why some sons and daughters of Etsako came together and contributed some amount of money to assist the family of the deceased vigilante boss and others who sustained injuries during the attack on the community,” he said. In his remarks, Mr Yakubu Musa a member of the group said the donation was to be used to assist the late vigilante chairman in staking his life to protect someone else. The village head of Ikabigbo, Bramah Alegeh and some vigilante leaders commended the group for its efforts at assuaging the plight of the victims. The vigilantes, however, promised to ensure adequate security of lives and properties in the Etsako Federal Constituency and Edo North District in general.
