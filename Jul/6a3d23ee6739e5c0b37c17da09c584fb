Governor Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe State on Tuesday described the choice of former governor of Borno, Kashim Shettima as Vice Presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as a good decision. Yahaya claimed the decision would guarantee victory for the APC in next year’s general elections. He said this in a statement in Gombe by Mr Ismaila Uba-Misilli, the Director-General, Press Affairs, Gombe Government House. The governor said the choice of Shettima was a masterstroke that would facilitate the party’s smooth sailing to victory in the upcoming 2023 presidential elections. According to Yahaya, the former Borno State governor is a committed and loyal party man and a great asset to the ruling party. Yahaya stated that Shettima would add “immeasurable” value to the APC presidential ticket. ”Asiwaju will not have made a better choice. The former Borno state governor is a highly cerebral, eloquent, competent, courageous and cosmopolitan leader,” Yahaya said. “Shettima has succeeded in building bridges, reputation and friendships across the country; and I believe he has the capacity, acumen and political sagacity to deputise the Jagaban. “With his background as a former lecturer, banker, agricultural economist, ex-governor and parliamentarian with visionary and patriotic ideologies, Sen. Shettima will be a ’round peg in a round hole’ as a vice president.”
