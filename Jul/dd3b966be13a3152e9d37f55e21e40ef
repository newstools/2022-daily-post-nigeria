Kashim Shettima, All Progressives Congress (APC) 2023 Vice-Presidential candidate has insisted that he never supported the party’s presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu in order to be his running mate. Shettima disclosed this on Wednesday in Abuja when he was formally presented as the party’s Vice-Presidential candidate by Sen. Abdullahi Adamu, the APC National Chairman. Commenting on his nomination and the APC Muslim-Muslim ticket, Shettima, who currently represents Borno Central in the National Assembly, said, “I don’t intend to be Vice-President to represent members of the Muslim community. No, the Sultan of Sokoto is capable of doing that. “I do not seek to be the Vice-Presidential of Nigeria to protect the interest of the Hausa Kanuri tribe in the North, no. “Asiwaju Bola Tinubu believes in the Nigerian project, and I swear in the name of God that I never supported Asiwaju to be his running mate. “I supported the project because of moral compulsion.”
