Paris Saint-Germain forward, Neymar, has decided that he wants to stay at the club amid reports linking him with a move away from the French Ligue 1 champions. Neymar, who admitted that he doesn’t know what kind of plans PSG have for him, ruled out any possibility of leaving the Parisians. The Brazilian international has been linked with a move away from PSG this summer, with Chelsea among the teams credited with an interest in signing him. PSG are said to be open to selling the former Barcelona star this summer. “I want to stay at Paris Saint Germain. No one from the club told me anything about the plans for my future, as things stand,” Neymar was quoted by Express UK as saying. “I don’t know what kind of plans they have for me – I want to stay”. Neymar, 30, has scored 100 goals in 144 games since joining PSG in 2017.
