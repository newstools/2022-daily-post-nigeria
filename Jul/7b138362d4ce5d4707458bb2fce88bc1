Real Madrid midfielder Casemiro, has welcomed Paris Saint-Germain’s Neymar to join the LaLiga champions in the near future. Casemiro and Neymar are both international teammates with the Brazilian national team. Neymar has been linked with a move away from PSG this summer. PSG are said to be open to offers for the former Barcelona star. Speaking about Neymar’s future, Casemiro told SporTV’s Circulo Grande programme: “Neymar can play for any team in the world. “If PSG don’t want him, Real Madrid want him. Okay?” A move to Real Madrid would be a controversial one, given Neymar spent four years with Spanish rivals Barcelona.
