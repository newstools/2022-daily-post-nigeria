Chelsea is planning to hijack Paris Saint-Germain’s deal for RB Leipzig’s Nordi Mukiele. The Blues have felt the pain of being beaten to the punch on a couple of occasions this summer. But now, the Stamford Bridge club are planning to do just that to PSG. According to Foot Mercato’s Santi Aouna, Chelsea has launched an eleventh-hour bid for Mukiele. The west London club are prepared to offer Timo Werner, a former Leipzig favourite, as part of the deal for the defender. Mukiele had looked destined for PSG after a £13 million deal had been agreed with the Bundesliga club. Despite the competition, the French Ligue 1 champions are said to remain confident that the 24-year-old centre-back will join them this week.
