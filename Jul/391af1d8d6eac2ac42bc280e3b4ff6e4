A former chairman of the reconciliation committee of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Rivers State, Dawari George has announced his resignation from the party. George, who is a strong ally to the former minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, made the announcement on Friday in Port Harcourt. The former commissioner for youths in Rivers State thanked the party for the support he got when he served in different capacities while with them. He, however, did not state the reason for his decision. In a letter addressed to the chairman of APC ward one in Asari Tori Local Government Area of the State, the former House of Representatives member wrote “I wish to resign my membership of the All Progressives Congress (APC). “May I also thank the leadership of the party and all her members for the opportunity and support given to me to serve the State and the country in different capacities during my time in the party. “I will always cherish the friendship and brotherhood which enforced our camaraderie in the party. “Please accept the assurances of my best regards.” His resignation came days after a former factional chairman of the party in the State, Golden Ben Chioma announced his resignation from the party.
