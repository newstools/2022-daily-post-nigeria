Deputy President of the Senate, Ovie Omo-Agege, has said Sen. Kashim Shettima’s emergence as vice presidential candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 presidential election is a nomination plus for the ruling party’s presidential ticket. Omo-Agege in a message issued by Ima Niboro, his Director, Communications and Media Strategy, described Shettima as detribalised and visionary Nigerian, adding that he is inclusive in perspective and shuns all bigotry. He said, “Our presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, could not have made a better choice. “It’s no surprise that the Borno State Chapter of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has immediately given support of Shettima’s selection as Tinubu’s running mate.” “As governor of a dominantly Kanuri state he had, amongst his closest aides, an Igbo Christian from Anambra, an Urhobo Christian from Delta Central Senatorial District. “He also had a Christian from Edo, a Yoruba Christian from the Southwest, a Fulani man from Gombe and a Hausa man from Zamfara,” he said. According to Omo-Agege, the APC vice presidential candidate is a forthright, vocal and outspoken politician who speaks truth to power. “His rich profile in executive and legislative business, public and corporate governance will always be useful in steering the ship of state,” Omo-Agwege said.
