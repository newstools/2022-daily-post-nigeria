The two reasons why Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, decided against the club signing Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo have been revealed. Ronaldo has been heavily linked with a move to Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain, among others. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner has requested that Man United allow him to depart the club if a suitable offer arrives this summer. The Portugal captain is seemingly unsettled at Man United after they failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League. According to football transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, Tuchel decided against Chelsea signing Ronaldo because the German coach wanted different kinds of players and projects at the West London club. “Thomas Tuchel wants different kind of players and project, this is why he decided against Cristiano Ronaldo deal,” Romano tweeted on Friday. “Cristiano has turned down a formal, lucrative proposal from Saudi and an approach from MLS club. Ten Hag, waiting for him.” Ronaldo currently has 12 months remaining on his current deal at Manchester United.
