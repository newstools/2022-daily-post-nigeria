Manchester United midfielder, Bruno Fernandes, has been given a new squad number ahead of next season. Fernandes switches from no.18 ahead of the 2022/23 campaign and will now wear the No.8 jersey. The no.8 shirt at Manchester United was vacated by Fernandes’ close friend Juan Mata. Recall that Mata left Man United this summer following the conclusion of the 2021/22 season. Man United disclosed this in a post via its website on Thursday. Fernandes joined Man United from Sporting CP in 2020.
