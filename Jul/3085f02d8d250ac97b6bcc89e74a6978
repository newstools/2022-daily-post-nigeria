A Kaduna-based activist, Prof. Suleiman Dansoko, has advised President Muhammadu Buhari not to be anxious to leave office until he cleans all the mess he created for Nigeria. President Buhari had told party supporters, who paid him Sallah homage in Daura last week, that governance is too tough and he is eager to hand over. Reacting on Friday, Dansoko, who was formally Head of Department, Bayero University Kano, but now a social activist and political analyst told President Buhari that if he is feeling the heat, Nigerians are only depending on God’s grace to survive. He said the president should put everything right just the way he met things in 2015 before stepping out of Aso Rock. According to him, there is no father that will tell his children that he cannot provide their needs, or that he will run out of the home because he faces tough times. “Please, Mr. President, we all welcome all your team; bandits attack, killing, hunger, inflation, sickness, unemployment, sacking from Government jobs. But, before you go, do your possible best, to settle them, let them leave before you go. Don’t leave any of your team members behind,” he said. According to him, even though, they all complained about the previous administration before Buhari’s, it was better as all forms of criminalities were not recorded then.
