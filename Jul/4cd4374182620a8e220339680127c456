The GUTS foundation, in its quest towards a more participatory 2023 election has taken another giant step towards sensitizing Nigerians on the need to be part of the electoral process in the build up to the 2023 elections. This time, the foundation embarked on a journey to Karu Site in Nasarawa State to educate residents on the importance of registering and obtaining their Permanent Voters Card, PVC. The visit of the foundation to the community put pressure on residents to come out of a deep state of apathy as over 2000 of them were successfully registered and directed to go to INEC offices to conclude the process.  Employing the same campaign strategy used in Abuja, the nation’s capital that resulted in a massive online registration of voters, the foundation got the attention of the community through music, games, and other side attractions. The visit did not happen without a cost as food was served to support those who came out to register. Onlookers were not left out as they also benefited from the foundation’s gesture. According to the organizers, Karu Site is only a few kilometers from Abuja, and “it’s only natural to capture the community, and by extension, each one will now tell one in Nasarawa state the importance of participating in the nation’s election.  According to the team, no amount of complaints can change things if as Nigerians, “we don’t sensitize our communities on the need to arm themselves with PVC in order to be part of their future project. “We have decided to embark on this grassroots campaign in order to enlighten our people that their future is completely tied to their participation in politics. And how can one participate without a PVC?,” Miss Nianu Ntor-ue, a
GUTS representative said.
