The Director-General of the Voice of Nigeria, VON, Osita Okechukwu, on Sunday predicted that the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, would win the 2023 elections. Okechukwu said Tinubu would win the presidential election by 60 percent. The founding member of APC made the prediction while addressing journalists at APC National Secretariat in Abuja. He noted that APC has more lawmakers at the National Assembly, adding that they would work towards Tinubu’s victory. Okechukwu stressed that APC members in the National Assembly would not betray Tinubu in 2023. He insisted that the chances of the APC presidential candidate winning the 2023 presidential election were very high. According to Tinubu: “Asiwaju has 60 percent of winning this election. We are in charge of 22 states of the federation. We have the majority in the National and State Houses of Assembly – they are not going to betray him. “Even in the South-East, that has never been our (APC) stronghold, on the day of the election, we are going there to protect our mandate. “Tinubu can win in Nigeria if you can’t have northern support. No northerner can win without a southern stronghold. That’s why I’m giving Tinubu about 60% chances.”
