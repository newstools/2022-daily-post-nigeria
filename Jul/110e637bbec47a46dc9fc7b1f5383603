The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA in the forthcoming 2023 general election, Prof. Benard Odoh has vowed to tackle communal wars and pursue Social justice if elected governor. Odoh made this known in a statement signed and issued to journalists by his press secretary, Charles Otu in Abakaliki capital of Ebonyi State. The former secretary to Ebonyi State Government vowed to aggressively pursue peace and social justice for all. He maintained that he and his party represent the best the citizens of the state deserve in the 2023 general elections. According to him: “I did a design that will help take our people off the streets of Lagos. A very effective idea and the Lagos state government was prepared to partner with us. They were prepared to provide training centres, implement, and provide monitoring and evaluation of those processes for a period of six months to one year. “We cannot be a government that will sit in the Government House in Abakaliki and watch our people populate the streets of major cities hawking. We will not allow that to happen. We are deeply committed to educating our people. The moment we have the right policies, our people will return home. “You have the APC, the PDP and the APGA. So, no political party will just sit down there and watch the wrong places take place. I believe we have about 7 months to the election and in all the areas we have gaps, we are working hard to close such gaps. “So we are not bothered about the issue of incumbency. The challenges that confront us now as a people is way above the issue of incumbency and I believe we will work our way through to the end.” He said
