Cristiano Ronaldo’s desire to leave Manchester United has hit a new low, after Barcelona turned down the opportunity to sign him. The Portugal captain was offered to the LaLiga giants despite his history with their bitter rivals Real Madrid. Ronaldo is determined to quit Old Trafford this summer and he has not reported to the club’s pre-season tour of Asia due to “family reasons”. But the 37-year-old’s exit strategy has become increasingly desperate. Ronaldo’s agent, Jorge Mendes, has offered him to top European clubs but has been unable to find a buyer for the striker. The player was rejected by Atletico Madrid on the grounds that they cannot afford to fund the transfer because of their financial situation, while Real Madrid have no intention of re-signing him. Spanish radio station Cope has outlined how Mendes even sensationally offered his client to Barcelona this summer but received a negative response. That Ronaldo would rather play for the Catalan club next season rather than United speaks volumes of his intentions to leave.
