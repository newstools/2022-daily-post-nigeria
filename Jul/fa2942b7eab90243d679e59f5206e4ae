No fewer than 93 suspected cultists have been arrested and prosecuted in four months by the Ogun State Police Command, the Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, has said. Bankole spoke on Thursday while parading some suspects at the State police headquarters, Eleweran, Abeokuta. Represented by the Police Public Relations Officer in Ogun, Abimbola Oyeyemi, Bankole explained that “the command successfully prosecuted 93 members of different cult groups in Ogun State between March and July.” According to him, the command is determined to “flush out unwanted elements” in the state so as to make the state more peaceful for law-abiding residents. DAILY POST reports that cult clashes had claimed many lives in Ogun in the past few months. In Sagamu, the Akarigbo and Paramount Ruler of Remoland, Oba Babatunde Ajayi, has gone spiritual in his efforts to find a lasting end to cult killings in the area. But, the police Commissioner insisted that the command would leave no stone unturned to rid the state of cultists.
