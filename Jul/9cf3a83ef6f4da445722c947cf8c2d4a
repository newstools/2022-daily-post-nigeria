Super Falcons head coach, Randy Waldrum has strong words for the Nigerian media following his side’s impressive 2-0 win against Botswana on Thursday night. The title holders were roundly criticised for their poor display in their opening game against South Africa at the ongoing 2022 Africa Women’s Cup of Nations in Morocco. Waldrum’s side, however, bounced back with a spirited display against the Mares. Onumonu put the Super Falcons in the lead in the 21st minute when she raced past her markers, before putting the ball beyond the advancing goalkeeper, Maitumelo Bosija following a delightful pass from hardworking midfielder Halimat Ayinde. Substitute Christy Ucheibe put the game beyond Botswana by netting the second three minutes after the break. “Media in Nigeria is very negative. We don’t want distraction in our team,” Waldrum said at the post match press conference. “We are trying to qualify for the World Cup and the teams must be isolated.” The Super Falcons will take on Burundi in their final group game on Sunday.
