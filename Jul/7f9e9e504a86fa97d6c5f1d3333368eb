Chelsea midfielder, Jorginho, has hailed the club’s latest recruit, Kalidou Koulibaly. Jorginho said Chelsea have signed the best replacement for Antonio Rudiger, who recently joined Real Madrid, in the shape of his former teammate Koulibaly. Asked about the role he played in Koulibaly’s transfer to Chelsea from Napoli, the Italy international was quoted by Football London as saying: “I was just a friend talking to him saying let’s play together again. I used to play with you, it’s been a long time. Come on, let’s play together again.'” “Oh definitely, for me, it’s the best replacement,” Jorginho added when asked if Koulibaly would prove the ideal replacement for Rudiger. “The best choice the club could have made together with the staff and the coach. I just really hope and I’m pretty sure he will be a big help to our team. “Of course, we are excited because it means new players are coming to help the team and help the club to achieve important things. It’s what Chelsea is all about.”
