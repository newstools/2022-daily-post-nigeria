The Deputy National Director, Print Media of the Atiku Support Organization, Eric Ekwere has claimed that the Labour Party presidential candidate, Mr Peter Obi cannot win the 2023 presidential election without party structure. DAILY POST reports that some Nigerians had pointed out the lack of structure in the Labour Party as a major obstacle for the former Anambra State Governor. But the LP candidate had severally stated that the millions of poor Nigerians made up his party structure. However, speaking with DAILY POST, Ekwere said there is nothing like human structure, stressing that even churches have committees. He said, “Nigerian youths should find a better way of coming together to form a structure. “There is nothing like human structure. Even churches have committees. So there is no direction as it stands, hence the result is far from them. “Is Peter Obi a young person? If they truly want to change the older politician to a younger person, is Obi also a young person? How old is Peter Obi”?
