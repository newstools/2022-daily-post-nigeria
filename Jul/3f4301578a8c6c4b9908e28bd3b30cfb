Arsenal legend, Paul Merson, has identified Manchester City as the club that will win the English Premier League (EPL) title next season. Manchester City won the EPL title last season ahead of the likes of Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur. But Merson believes Pep Guardiola’s side will win the English top-flight league title again because they have Erling Haaland in their squad, which he described as a massive boost. “I think Manchester City will win the Premier League, but I’ve to say it is not as much of a foregone conclusion as others make it out to be,” Merson was quoted by Sportskeeda as saying. “Erling Haaland’s arrival is obviously a massive boost for Pep Guardiola, but it is not the end of it with Liverpool still very much in the running. “The only worry for Liverpool, on the other hand, is that they have lost an unbelievable player in Sadio Mane, who scored big goals for them over the years. “If Jurgen Klopp can get Nunez fired immediately, it will be tight once again, but if that does not happen, I think Manchester City should win the Premier League.”
