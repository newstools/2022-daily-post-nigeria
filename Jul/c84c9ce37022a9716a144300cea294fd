A member of the Kaduna State House of Assembly representing Zaria City Constituency, Honourable Suleiman Ibrahim Dabo, on Wednesday, warned traditional rulers and religious leaders in the state over unguarded utterances that could heat up polity in the state. He said religious leaders and traditional rulers are the custodians of the people, whatever comes out of their mouth, is being regarded as authority or statement that “could either unite us together, as a people, or set the state or nation on fire.” He urged leaders to stop making inflammatory comments capable of setting NIgeria on fire. Honourable Dabo, who is the Chairman House Committee on Education, expressed this, while fielding questions from newsmen on the sidelines of a one-day Public Dialogue With Candidates On Agenda Setting For the 2023 General Elections, organised by the Partnership to Engage, Reform and Learn (PERL/FCDO) in Kaduna. Honourable Suleiman Ibrahim Dabo Zaria City Constituency Kaduna State House of Assembly further informed traditional institution/religious leaders that whatever they said, they should remember that they have followers, adding that Nigeria is our country, and we don’t have anywhere to go. According to him, based on the timetable by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), there is enough time to campaign before the general elections, as such, all leaders must adhere strictly to norms of electioneering campaign.
