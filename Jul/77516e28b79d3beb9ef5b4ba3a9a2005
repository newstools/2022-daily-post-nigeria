Osita Okechukwu, the Director-General of Voice of Nigeria, VON, has described the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu and his running mate, Kashim Shettima as moderate Muslims. Okechukwu said Tinubu and his running mate are moderate and not ultra Muslims. He stated that the choice of Shettima as Tinubu’s running mate was a good pick. In a statement he signed, the VON boss described Tinubu and Shettima as an “excellent ticket.” He noted that Shettima performed well while he was the governor of Borno State, and would replicate such under Tinubu in 2023. The statement reads partly: “On the choice of Distinguished Sen. Kashim Shettima as Vice Presidential Candidate, I think it is an excellent joint ticket. “An excellent joint ticket because Shettima is a transparent man of action and capable as Asiwaju pointed out. “On the issue of Muslim-Muslim ticket, as a Christian one would have preferred Muslim-Christian ticket; however, there was the likely input of Northern Governors who are staunch supporters of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. “The good news is that both are moderate Muslims, not ultra Muslims.” The APC presidential candidate had unveiled Shettima as his running mate after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday in Daura, Katsina State. Against popular opinions by Nigerians, Tinubu opted for a Muslim-Muslim ticket.
