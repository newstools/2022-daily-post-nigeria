Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide has expressed its support for former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu. The Enugu lawmaker is being detained in the United Kingdom. Ekweremadu and his wife, Beatrice, are facing trial in a Westminster Court. They are accused of coercing a minor, David Ukpo, to have his kidney harvested and transferred to their daughter, Sonia. The couple deny the allegation, insisting Ukpo is an adult and had agreed to the surgery. In a statement on Thursday, Chairman, Ohanaeze Council of Elders, Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu said they would not abandon Ekweremadu. The elder statesman notes that the council defends honest and patriotic citizens whose right and freedom is trampled upon. Iwuanyanwu said Ekweremadu has been an active member of the group, disclosing that his arrest in London was received with shock.
