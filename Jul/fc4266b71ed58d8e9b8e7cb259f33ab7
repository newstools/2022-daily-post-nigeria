The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), has lambasted the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, over its position on Bola Tinubu’s choice of vice-presidential candidate for the 2023 general elections. The Islamic human rights organisation accused the Christian body of heating up the polity with its comment on Tinubu’s choice of former Borno State Governor, Senator Kashim Shettima as running mate. MURIC’s response was contained in a statement issued on Tuesday, signed by the group’s director, Professor Ishaq Akintola. “Tinubu is under CAN’s hammer for picking a Muslim, Senator Kashim Shettima, as his vice-presidential candidate and Rev. John Hayab of Kaduna State chapter of the organization is the axe man for CAN,” MURIC said. The group said the CAN would never be satisfied with a Muslim as president of Nigeria. According to the group, a Muslim becoming a President of Nigeria will not suit CAN’s agenda of Nigeria for Christ. “CAN is simply hungry for power. We know CAN. The group has been canvassing for a Christian running mate not for the benefit of Nigerians but for parochial ends. “The idea is to milk the Christian vice presidential candidate if his party wins in the end by claiming that the Christian umbrella body fought for him. It is for political influence, for contracts and for power. We advise CAN to form its own political party. “It is not written in the constitution that a candidate must not pick a running mate from his own religious group. “Nigerians should not allow themselves to be deceived by CAN’s spiritual banditry. We warn CAN to leave Tinubu alone.”
