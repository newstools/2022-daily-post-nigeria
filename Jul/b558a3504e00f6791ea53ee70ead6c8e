No fewer than ten people have been injured after suspected thugs invaded the venue of a meeting of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) youths in Ologba in Dekina Local Government Area of Kogi State. According to eyewitness accounts, guns, knives, horns and other dangerous weapons were used by the invading thugs during the attack. DAILY POST gathered that the hoodlums also burnt several vehicles and motorcycles belonging to some PDP members. The house of the opposition party’s youth leader in Iyale was also set ablaze. “There is serious tension in Dekina LGA. The thugs came to the PDP youth meeting venue yesterday at Ologba, destroyed properties, burnt vehicles and motorcycles,” one of the sources said. In November 2019, the PDP woman leader in Ochadamu Ward, Ofu Local Government Area, Mrs Acheju Abuh was killed by suspected political thugs, who burnt her alive in her home. The prominent politician was sleeping in her home when political thugs set the building on fire. DAILY POST, however, made efforts to hear from the Kogi State Police Relations Officer, SP William Ovye Aya about the incident. He failed to pick his calls and did not respond to text messages sent to his phone lines.
