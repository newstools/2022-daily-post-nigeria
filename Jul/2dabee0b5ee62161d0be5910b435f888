Former West Ham United striker, Frank McAvennie, has slammed fans who blamed Cristiano forward Ronaldo for Manchester United’s misfortunes in the 2021-2022 campaign. McAvennie branded Ronaldo’s critics as ’embarrassing’, adding that they prefer Anthony Martial or Marcus Rashford to the five-time Ballon d’Or winner. The Scot believes it was the managers’ incompetence that led to Man United’s “demise” last season and not Ronaldo, who scored over 20 goals for the Red Devils. Ronaldo scored 24 goals in 38 games across competitions for Man United last season. Despite Ronaldo’s exploits, some fans criticized him for his apparent frustration with teammates, blaming him for Man United’s nervy showings. “Ronaldo was moaning about players losing the ball and not trying to win it back last season,” McAvennie told Football Insider. “People were blaming him for the demise of Man United, oh my god he scored 20 odd goals. It is embarrassing. “They would rather have Martial or Rashford than Ronaldo. They should have thrived with someone like Ronaldo and [Edinson] Cavani beside them but they didn’t. If the manager plays the same team as last year, United won’t win anything.”
