The member representing Iseyin/Itesiwaju/Kajola/Iwajowa federal constituency of Oyo State, Shina Abiola Peller, has been declared the Accord Party candidate for the Oyo North Senatorial District in the 2023 general elections. The declaration was made on Tuesday in Saki town. Peller, an indigene of Iseyin town was declared the Accord party candidate immediately after the initial candidate, Prince Michael Ademola Ojo, publicly announced his resolve to willingly withdraw from the race. DAILY POST recalls that the lawmaker was elected in 2019. Our correspondent reports that Ojo wholeheartedly handed over the senatorial ticket to Peller on Tuesday. The event christened “Official Affirmation of Accord party’s candidate for Oyo North Senatorial District” was witnessed by the state Chairman of the Accord Party, Prince Felix Kolade Ojo. Present at the event were party chairmen in all the 13 local governments that make up the senatorial district, representatives of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security agents. Giving reasons for stepping down for Peller, Ademola Ojo said he took the decision in the interest of the people of the zone. He said, “In the overall interest of our people in Oke Ogun and Oyo North Senatorial District at large, I hereby willingly withdraw from the race and wholeheartedly transfer the mandate I have to contest for the Oyo North Senatorial District seat on the platform of Accord to my dear brother, Honourable Shina Peller.” The party’s returning officer for the district, Mr. Abdullahi Ayemojuba, then declared Peller as the Accord party’s candidate for the Oyo North Senatorial District in the 2023 general election.
