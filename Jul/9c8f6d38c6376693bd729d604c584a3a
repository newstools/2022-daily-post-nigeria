David Adeleke, better known as Davido, has praised President Muhammadu Buhari over the Osun governorship election outcome. The music star’s uncle and former Senator Ademola Adeleke defeated Governor Gboyega Oyetola. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate polled 403,371 votes while the All Progressives Congress (APC) flagbearer got 375,027. Ademola won in 17 of the 30 local government areas of the state after voting took place in 3,763 polling units. Reacting, President Muhammadu Buhari said he remained “fully committed to leaving behind a legacy of credible elections in Nigeria”. In reply, Davido tweeted: “You will leave a LASTING legacy! God bless you for this act alone sir!” Like in 2018 when Adeleke lost to Oyetola, the artiste also played a major role during the 2022 campaign. Davido, his aides, other Adeleke sons, and friends attended rallies and toured the state to garner support for the winner.
