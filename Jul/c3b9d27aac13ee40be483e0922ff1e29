The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ekiti State has appointed Engr Alaba Agboola as the substantive Chairman of the party in the state. Engr Agboola from Ijero Ekiti will replace the party’s governorship candidate in the last election, Hon Bisi Kolawole, who resigned as the state chairman to contest the governorship. The appointment of Engr Agboola as the substantive state chairman was among the resolutions at the State Executive Committee meeting held in Ado Ekiti today.

Alaba Agboola as substantive Chairman, to serve out the remainder of the tenure of our said erstwhile Chairman. “It was also resolved that Hon.
