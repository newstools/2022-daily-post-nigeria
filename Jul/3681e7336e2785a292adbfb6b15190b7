Names of two players that could replace Manchester United forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, at Old Trafford have been revealed. Ronaldo had last weekend informed Man United that he wants to leave the club. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner has not returned to Manchester United for pre-season training. Ronaldo was scheduled to return on Monday, however, due to family reasons, he has not joined yet. With Man United failing to qualify for the UEFA Champions League last season, Ronaldo leaving the Red Devils was always a possibility. And this became a fact in April, and, therefore, the timing of Ronald’s decision came as a bit of a surprise to many. However, DAILY POST reports three players Man United could sign to replace Ronaldo should he leave Old Trafford this summer. The first player is Bayern Munich’s Robert Lewandowski, who is keen to leave the Bundesliga champions this summer. If Man United want to get a perfect replacement for Ronaldo when it comes to goals, there is no better option on the market than Lewandowski. Though, the Poland international still has a year left in his current deal at Bayern. The second player is Andrea Belotti, who scored over 100 goals in 230 appearances for Torino. Belotti is currently a free agent. This means attaining his services will not affect Man United’s transfer budget for the summer.
