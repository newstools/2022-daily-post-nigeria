The Leader Of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, has issued a caution to the Labour Party, LP, presidential candidate, Peter Obi, and the New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP, Rabiu Kwankwaso. Primate Ayodele said Obi and Kwankwaso are noisemakers who can’t win the 2023 presidential election. He disclosed this while addressing journalists in his church on Saturday in Lagos, during the release of his annual prophecies, “Warnings to the Nations.” According to Ayodele: “Peter Obi is a noise maker; he can’t make a single difference. Saying Obi will win the election is zero. “Kwankwaso is also a noise maker; he can’t win the election. Tinubu, Obi, and Atiku can’t restructure Nigeria.” He also warned Nigerians that the 2023 elections wouldn’t solve the country’s problems. Primate Ayodele said only restructuring could resolve Nigeria’s problems. “Nigeria will still be having the same problems we are having. “The solution to our problem is not the 2023 elections; it will still put us in the same problems, if not worst. 2023 elections will put us where we are with insecurity and the economy. And the solution to our problems is restructuring; we will have freedom the day Nigeria is restructured,” he added.
