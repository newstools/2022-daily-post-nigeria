Lisandro Martinez’s personal chief, Kabir Kohli has confirmed his move to Manchester United. Kohli, in posts he shared on both Instagram and Twitter, bade farewell to Martinez while pleading with fans of the Red Devils to take care of the defender. According to Kohli, all his efforts to stop the Netherlands to join Erik ten Hag’s side and remain at Ajax proved abortive. Kohli uploaded a photo on Instagram with the Argentinian centre-back, with the caption, “Farewell dinner”, adding: “Man Utd fans – treat him well”. The chef also tweeted: “Despite my best attempts at trying to convince Lisandro Martinez to stay for another year at Ajax, unfortunately, it seems like he’s off to Man Utd. “Man Utd fans – take care of him. He’s awesome!” Talk Sports reports that the Red Devils originally had a £42million bid for the player rejected by Ajax, but are now said to have met the Dutch club’s £46m asking price.
