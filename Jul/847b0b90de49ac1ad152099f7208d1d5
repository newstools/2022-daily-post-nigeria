President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday called for the establishment of an International Anti-Corruption Court to try offenders. Buhari urged African leaders to intensify the fight against corruption, and create more disincentives for pilfering of public funds. In his remarks on the African Day of Anti-Corruption, he said efforts must be intensified to prosecute offenders and get back resources stored in other countries. “Corruption is evil and all efforts at tackling it are desirable. I have monitored the fight against corruption in Africa and I can see both successes and drawbacks. “The battle must continue for the sake of the continent and its people no matter the difficulties. ‘In Nigeria, the fight against corruption has been vigorous since 2015. A lot has been achieved in the areas of arrest, prosecution, conviction, asset recovery and anti-corruption laws.” The President noted that more work on many fronts is required, advising civil and public servants to be ethical and professional at all times. He said the private sector must contribute to curbing corruption, while the international community needs to close safe havens. “The judiciary requires more impetus. Perhaps, an International Anti-corruption Criminal Court is needed.” Buhari also wants family, schools and religions to do more to discourage corruption for a better society. The Nigerian leader said for the continent to realize its full potential, “we must get rid of corruption in Africa”. Buhari added that as his tenure ends next year, he is proud to leave behind a legacy of fighting corruption among others. “I abhor corruption and I will render my best in or out of office to get rid of corruption. I urge our youths to join me in this noble cause”, he said.
