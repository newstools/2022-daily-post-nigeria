The Pro-Chancellor of Adeleke University, Dr Deji Adeleke, has threatened the Osun State Governor-elect, Ademola Adeleke, against derailing the state. Adeleke, who is the father of popular Nigerian singer, Davido, threatened to call a press conference against Adeleke if his administration derails from improving Osun State. He disclosed this at the 8th undergraduate and 4th postgraduate convocation of Adeleke University over the weekend. Adeleke, who is the Governor-elect’s elder brother, insisted that Ademola has no reason to fail because he is not answerable to any godfather. According to Adeleke: “I told the governor-elect (my brother) and his colleagues that they are lucky because they do not have any godfather to refund any money to, so whatever people contributed for the election is contribution and it’s a sacrifice for a better Nigeria, for a better state, so the governor-elect and his colleagues are not under any pressure, the only thing they need to do out there is to go and serve the people. “And I threatened them that I will be the first to call the press conference if I see things going wrong with his government, I will be the first to alert the world that your governor has derailed. I’ve also told him and his team not to allow anyone that is not ready to serve, anyone that his focus is to come and look for money to steal from the poor people (Osun is a very poor state) into the team.”
