Prof. Kabiru Bala, Vice-Chancellor, Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, said the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) strike dampens his spirit. The Don spoke on Monday at a meeting organised by the Kano Zone of ASUU. Bala noted that the industrial action has lasted 140 days, affecting the economy of host communities. He urged the government, ASUU and stakeholders to consider the effect of the strike on the citizens. Bala said Ahmadu Bello University had more than 30,000 students who spent at least N300 each on food. “We also have more than 13,000 employees each of whom has an average of three to five dependents who feed on a daily basis. “The strike also has far-reaching implications on security.” Bala added that the strike was also affecting lecture theatres, classrooms and laboratories. “When I look between the ABU Senate Building and the Engineering Department complex, I feel like shedding tears as nobody is using the facilities. “These are infrastructure provided by the government, but are left fallow for months”, the VC complained.
