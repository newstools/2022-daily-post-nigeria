Chelsea are currently in negotiations with five defenders as they look to reinforce their backline this summer, The Telegraph reports. The five players are Nathan Ake, Jules Kounde, Matthijs de Ligt, Presnel Kimpembe and Kalidou Koulibaly. The departures of Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen have left Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, in dire need of defensive recruits ahead of the upcoming new season. Recall that Rudiger joined Real Madrid this summer while Christensen signed for Barcelona. Chelsea are reportedly in talks with Manchester City to sign Ake with the centre-back, having agreed on personal terms. The Blues are also in discussion with Sevilla, Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus and Napoli in a bid to sign Kounde, Kimpembe, De Ligt and Koulibaly. De Ligt, meanwhile, is said to prefer a move to Bundesliga champions, Bayern Munich.
