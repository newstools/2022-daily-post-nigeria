Pastor Tunde Bakare of the Citadel Global Community Church Serving has called on Nigerians to prioritise nation building over ethnicity and religion. Bakare, who was one of the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential aspirants, stated this during a sermon on Sunday. Reacting to the controversy surrounding the APC presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s choice of running mate, the popular pastor kicked against religious sentiment in politics. According to him, what the country needs is leadership that would work for both Christian and Muslims. He said, “We dream of a Nigeria in which every woman as well as every man will be able to aspire to any political office at any time without playing the ethnic card and without recourse to it’s our turn or it’s their turn. “What we need is a New Nigeria that works for every Nigerian, Christian as well as Muslim. Nationhood, rather than divisiveness, must be the objective of every engagement.” Recall that there have been public outcries against the decision of Tinubu to choose the former Borno State governor, Kashim Shettima, who is of the same faith with him, as his running mate.
