Tolu Ogunlesi has declared that the 2023 contest will still be between the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Ogunlesi is the Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Digital and New Media. In a Twitter post, he stirred a conversation about the top parties seeking Nigerians’ votes in next year’s general election. Ogunlesi questioned why many compare the APC and the PDP but leave out the Labour Party (LP). He reminded the public that LP presidential, vice-presidential candidates and former VP placeholder were PDP members. Peter Obi contested the 2019 poll alongside Atiku Abubakar; Datti Baba-Ahmed sought the 2023 Kaduna PDP governorship ticket. Also, Doyin Okupe, a long-time PDP chieftain, earlier declared his intention to run for presidency under the platform. Ogunlesi, however, noted that APC’s former and current candidates (President Buhari and Bola Tinubu) were never in the PDP. “The two Presidential candidates APC has so far presented in its history have NEVER been in PDP. “LP candidates (Pres, VP, placeholder VP)—all ex-PDP. So how are APC and PDP the same but LP is somehow different?. “APC = APC; PDP = PDP; LP = PDP Lite – Lite [L] PDP [P] (which is more a compliment actually, less legacy baggage, more youth appeal, but still PDP). “As far as APC is concerned 2023 is still a contest between APC and PDP (in multiple guises)”, he wrote. The tweet is generating reactions with tweeps expressing divergent opinions in favour of either of the three parties.
