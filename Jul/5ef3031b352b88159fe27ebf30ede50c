The Convener of the National Peace Committee, Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah, said violence is a fundamental threat to Nigeria’s democracy. He, however, charged the aspirants and politicians to see the signing of the peace accord as a symbolic commitment to democracy adding that Nigeria desperately needs a peaceful environment. Also speaking, the Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu appealed to all political parties, candidates and other actors to play their part in supporting the Peace Accord. It is not enough to simply sign the Peace Accord. He said, “What is more important is to abide by its letter and spirit. This is the best way to show your commitment to the implementation of the Peace Accord and your appreciation of the work of the Peace Committee. In the same vein, the DIG Johnson Babatunde who represented Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba, also appealed to political actors to play by the rule of the game.

Security is our collective responsibility, ” he said. In his words, the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi Ojaja II, said “Power belongs to the people, you can only try your best. We appeal to all our political actors to follow the rules of the game as we look forward to a peaceful election come this Saturday 16th July 2022.”
