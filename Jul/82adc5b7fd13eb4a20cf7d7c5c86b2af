A former governorship aspirant under the All Progressives Congress, APC, Prince Tonye Princewill has become the latest member of the party to leave. Princewill announced his resignation in a letter he personally signed and addressed to the ward chairman of the APC in Ward 3 in Buguma Asari Toru Local Government Area of Rivers State. The former APC chieftain identified the choice of the “Muslim-Muslim” presidential ticket by the party as his reason for resigning, adding that he cannot defend the choice of a Muslim to deputize another Muslim “, especially at a time like this, against all protestations from well-meaning Nigerians, across religious and political divides”. In the letter, Princewill said he “cannot argue for equity in my state and defend inequity in my country”, saying even if the APC wins the presidential election, “it sets a very wrong precedent, totally insensitive and will prove bad for good governance”. He further argued that President Muhammadu Buhari “resisted the same temptation and chose a little known Osinbajo and won”, stressing that the action of Bola Ahmed Tinubu means that “a Northern Christian has no electoral value”. He however expressed his appreciation to the former Minister of Transportation Chibuike Amaechi for all his effort in the party.
