The head of the Russian city’s military administration, Vadym Liakh has said that Russia is likely to try and mount an offensive towards Sloviansk. He added that Ukrainian forces are currently holding Russian troops on the Siverskyi Donets river. “Probably, they will [attack Sloviansk]. Probably, that is why the incoming hits have become more frequent,” Liakh said Wednesday, according to CNN. “I think that as soon as the enemy is able to carry out assault operations, it will begin the destruction of the infrastructure and the city itself.” The military head further explained that the frontline is now along the Siverskyi Donets river, a “natural obstacle” that Russia has already failed to surpass. According to him, many fortifications were built near Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, making it possible for Ukrainian troops “to restrain the enemy for 4 months.” So far, Russian forces have been stationed by the Siverskyi Donets river for a month, which he thinks “will continue to be this way. But, unfortunately, the civilian population will be shelled more and more often.”
