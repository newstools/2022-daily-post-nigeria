The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has told the National Examinations Council (NECO) to move its exam scheduled for Saturday, July 9, as it clashed with the first day of eid-el-Adha (Sallah). MURIC Director, Prof. Ishaq Akintola, made this request in a statement on Sunday. NECO has scheduled Data Processing (Practical) from 10am to 1pm this Saturday. Akintola admitted that the Islamic group believes NECO did not intentionally fix the examination that day. “We are fully aware that the clash was not deliberate as NECO had actually demonstrated goodwill by setting aside a whole week for Salah celebrations (Monday, 11th July to Friday 15th July) and this reflected in its timetable,” the statement read. He added, “We, therefore, appeal to the NECO authorities to kindly shift the examination of that day alone (Saturday 9th July, 2022) to another date in order to enable its teeming Muslim candidates sit for their examinations. “The paper which was originally fixed for Salah day may be taken on Thursday 14th July, 2022 which is one of the days set aside by NECO for the Salah holiday. MURIC wishes NECO authorities and staff as well as all Nigerians a happy Salah.”
