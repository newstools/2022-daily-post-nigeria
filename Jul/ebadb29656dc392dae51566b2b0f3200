The All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu has said he is carefully observing the terrorism and other challenges bedeviling the entire nation. In an interactive session with newsmen in Daura, Katsina State on Sunday, the former Lagos Governor said if elected as Nigerian President in 2023, his administration would defeat the challenges. Speaking on infrastructure, the APC National Leader said the party has a better programme that would serve Nigerians, assuring that “within a short period of time, there will be a good foundation for infrastructure”. “We have a better programme for the people and about the people and ready to serve. “We face the challenges of terrorism, we know that. It is only a poor thinker and observer that will not recognise the challenge. But once you recognise a challenge, you can prepare yourself very well and defeat it,” he said.
