Lagos State Government has shut the Redeemers Nursery and Primary School, Ogba. The sanction follows the death of a five-year-old pupil, Chidera Eze, during a swimming lesson. Chidera and his peers were reportedly playing close to the pool when he fell inside. The incident occurred in May at the Ivory Health Club in Ogundana Street, Ikeja. The deceased’s father, Anthony Eze, blamed his child’s death on the negligence of the school officials. On Monday, the Ministry of Education said the Redeemers School will remain closed, pending an administrative investigation. A statement by Commissioner for Education, Folashade Adefisayo said its operations, procedures and the conduct of officials regarding safety standards will be probed. She said a preliminary inquiry by the Office of Education Quality Assurance showed that the school is yet to conclude its registration, and thus not approved. The commissioner advised parents and guardians to note the closure and wait for the conclusion of the investigation. “The Ministry is concerned about the safety of the pupils, hence the need for intervention”, she noted.
