The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 2023 presidential candidate, former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar said agitation within the party provides them with an opportunity to come together stronger and united. Atiku stated this in a statement on Sunday amid agitation by some PDP governors led by Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike over his choice of Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa as running mate. He noted that when PDP gets better, the hope is higher than Nigeria’s rescue is near. The former Vice President said he admires democracy because it is a system with an intrinsic asset of crisis management. He explained that the most noteworthy outcome of a democratic process is the greater possibility of conflict generation. The statement partly read “so, a remarkable lesson that I have learned in politics is that in some instances, conflicts are healthy realities. “I know, for instance, that when conflicts arise out of genuine concerns about having an inclusive political process, it signposts the viability of that process and, more importantly, the eagerness of stakeholders to be active participants in the success of such process. “As leaders and stakeholders in the Peoples Democratic Party, the simmering agitations in our party are a reflection of our credential as a democratic party. “Whatever our agitations are, I believe it is borne out of collective concern for the growth of our party and the country. Therefore, I don’t see a divided house in the PDP. I see an opportunity for us to come together stronger and united.” Atiku assured that he will do everything possible to bring the party together under a formidable umbrella. He urged all party faithful not to lose focus of the bigger purpose of rescuing the country from the hardship that fellow Nigerians continue to endure under the ruling party.
