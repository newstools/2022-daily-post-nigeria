The All Progressives Congress, APC, has unveiled former Borno State Governor, Kashim Shettima as its 2023 presidential running mate. Shettima was unveiled at an event in Abuja on Wednesday. President Muhammadu Buhari’s former Personal Assistant on New Media, Bashir Ahmad, disclosed this via a tweet. “Our great party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), unveils Senator Kashim Shettima as the running mate of our presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu,” he tweeted. APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu had picked Shettima as his running mate following his emergence as the party’s presidential candidate. Tinubu’s choice of Shettima has continued to cause controversy across Nigeria. Most Nigerians wanted the APC presidential candidate to pick a Christian as his running mate, but he settled for a Northern Muslim instead.
