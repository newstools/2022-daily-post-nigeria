New Barcelona striker, Robert Lewandowski, has said Bayern Munich won’t have to bring in a direct replacement for him. Lewandowski has move to the Blaugrana in a €50million deal, ending his eight-year stay at Allianz Arena. It has been suggested that the 33-year-old’s exit has weakened Bayern, but he insists that Julian Nagelsmann still has plenty of high-quality alternatives to call upon in attack. Sadio Mane has been the only new addition to Bayern’s ranks in the final third so far this summer, but Lewandowski expects the German giants to adapt to life without him seamlessly. “I think Bayern have so many talented offensive players that you don’t necessarily need a No.9, a real centre forward,” Lewandowski has told Sport Bild. “Bayern’s attack is outstanding, they can manage it very well, even without a one-on-one replacement for me.”
