Scottish football legend, Ally McCoist believes there is no way back for Cristiano Ronaldo at Manchester United despite manager Erik ten Hag’s assurance. McCoist believes Ronaldo will not be part of Manchester United’s squad for next season, insisting that there’s no point holding onto a player who does not want to be at the club anymore. Ronaldo has handed out a transfer request, having grown frustrated at the lack of signings and also due to the absence of Champions League football next season. However, Ten Hag is optimistic that Ronaldo will join the squad soon and that the Portugal captain is part of his ‘plans’ for next season. The Dutchman said this during his pre-match press conference ahead of Man United’s pre-season friendly tie with Liverpool on Tuesday in Thailand. “He [Ronaldo] doesn’t want to be there, does he? I know ten Hag’s got to say the right thing which he was doing there and we all understand that. But the fact of the matter is, you don’t keep a player that is not happy. It could cause 1-2 problems in the dressing room,” McCoist said on the talkSPORT program. “He’s more or less said that he wants to get away, and 9/10 times, there’s no way back.”
