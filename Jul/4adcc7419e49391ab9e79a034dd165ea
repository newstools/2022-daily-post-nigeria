Abubakar Ishiaku, a 20-year-old man, has been apprehended with 20 bags of leaves suspected to be Indian hemp by policemen from the Federal Capital Territory Command. During a stop and search duty, he was spotted by a team of police but he fled abandoning his cargo. Josephine Adeh, spokesperson of the FCT police, in a statement explained that the man was arrested after investigations, he had been on the wanted list of the command and ran upon sighting policemen. According to the statement, “A team of policemen attached to Dutse Alhaji Divisional Police Headquarters on an intelligence stop and search intercepted a vehicle driven by one Abubakar Ishiaku, a 20-year-old male indigene of Kankara Local Government of Katsina State who has since been on the Command’s wanted list of drug peddlers.” The statement further explained that the suspect who took to his heels upon sighting the policemen on duty on the said date was re-arrested on July 14, 2022, following painstaking investigation while 20 bags of dried leaves suspected to be Indian hemp were recovered. It said that the suspects would be handed over to the NDLEA for prosecution. The police spokesperson also refuted reports that terrorists had infiltrated the Federal Capital Territory, saying that they had their camps in the mountains. The statement said the command has also caught the wave of unofficial reports emanating from malicious or attention-seeking individuals, targeted at promoting fear and apprehension in the minds of residents, suggesting that the territory is under a high infiltration of terrorists who are hibernating on mountain tops and hills. The statement said while the police and their sister agencies are working relentlessly to rid the FCT of criminal elements, and to sustain the relative peace enjoined in the territory, it urged members of the public to strongly eschew the circulation of any message not from an official stable and to go about their lawful business without the fear of harassment or molestation of any kind.
