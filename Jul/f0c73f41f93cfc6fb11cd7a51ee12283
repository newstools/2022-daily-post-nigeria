As the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) strike enters the sixth month in the night of July 14, the Federal Government says there’s is no deal yet. ASUU has been on an industrial action since February 14, with tens of thousands of undergraduates out of universities. On Wednesday, the government declared there was no Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) awaiting President Muhammad Buhari’s assent. Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige made the clarification in a statement by Olajide Oshundun, ministry’s Deputy Director, Press and Public Relations. Ngige accused the President of ASUU, Prof. Victor Osodeke and branch leaders of misinforming Nigerians. Ngige said when a CBA is produced between unions and the Federal Government, it is not the President that signs. “There is no such CBA that has been reached between the Federal Government, ASUU and other university unions on the renegotiation of their salaries and allowances (wages). “What is in existence is a proposal. Even when such CBA is made, it is not the president that signs it. From available records, no Nigerian President or sovereign signs such”, he explained. Ngige said ASUU’s demand for better conditions of service – wages, salaries, allowances and other public service matters – would be guided by relevant government ministries and agencies. The minister listed the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Labour and Employment, Budget office of the Federation. Others include the National Salaries Income and Wages Commission, Office of Head of Service of the Federation, through the Prof. Nimi Briggs Committee. Ngige said the team just like the Prof. Munzali Committee it replaced, is an internal committee of the Ministry of Education to receive ASUU’s demands and renegotiate the 2009 Agreement.
