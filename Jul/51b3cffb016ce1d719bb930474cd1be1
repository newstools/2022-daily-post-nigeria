Prophet Bisi Olujobi has advised Osun governor-elect, Ademola Adeleke to ensure good governance in the state. His statement on Monday noted that Adeleke was ordained “to re-write the history of Osun State with a golden pen”. “That is the main reason God chose him above others, the people have suffered enough. “God and men will not forgive him if he does otherwise”, the leader of Wisdom Church of God International warned. Olujobi however called for supplications for Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP). The cleric advised his supporters worldwide to embark on “strategic warfare prayer against assassination”. “There will be an attempt on his life. If they pray well, it will be averted”, he said. On the 2023 governorship battle in Lagos, the prophet called the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) standard bearer “a joker”. “Olajide Adediran (Jandor) is a joker, he will lose gallantly unless an immediate step is taken.” Olujobi added that he sees former Imo governor, Senator Rochas Okorocha “in chains”. “Okorocha needs to pray very hard for him not to suffer heavy loss politically.” On Ike Ekweremadu, the religious leader said the Senator would not “have an upper hand” in the case in the United Kingdom. “It has been settled spiritually against him except he prays very well”, the statement added.
