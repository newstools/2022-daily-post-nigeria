Manchester United legend, Teddy Sheringham has urged the Red Devils to sell forward Cristiano Ronaldo to raise funds to bring in two or three signings this summer. Ronaldo has told Man United that he wants to leave if they receive a suitable offer for him this summer. The Portugal captain is not happy with the club’s activity in the ongoing summer transfer market and he also wants to play Champions League football next season. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner has been linked with Chelsea, Bayern Munich and a host of other clubs. “I half saw it coming,” Sheringham told Sportsmail. “People are saying shall Ten Hag build his team around Ronaldo, but if he wants to go, he goes. That opens up a whole new corridor for United. “You could get in two or three players on that sort of wage and that is a lot of money they could spend each month. “Life goes on, he wants to go and play somewhere else, so get players in that you know who are going to be strong and stable throughout the season. “Ronaldo will have been watching what has been going on, he will feel the vibes from how it was in Fergie’s time and how the club is being run now and he will get the vibes that he does not like what he is seeing going on. “If you stand still in football, you fall and maybe Ronaldo sees the same. Where is that big signing coming from? “If I’m Ronaldo now, I’m saying go on then United, excite me…what are you doing in the transfer market. “Ronaldo has got maybe another year or two years max at the top level and he deserves to enjoy his football at the top of his game.”
