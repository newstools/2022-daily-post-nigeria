Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel has given his verdict on Raheem Sterling’s performance in Chelsea’s defeat to Charlotte in their second preseason game on Thursday morning. Thomas Tuchel’s side fell to defeat in the second game of their tour of the US, succumbing to a 5-3 defeat on penalties. Conor Gallagher missed a decisive spot kick to condemn the west London side to defeat Christian Pulisic opened the scoring for the Blues and an injury time penalty from Daniel Rios made it 1-1 after 90 minutes. Sterling showed some of the explosive pace with Tuchel pleased with the efforts of his new recruit. “I saw four accelerations in the second half and they all came from Raheem. “This is what he delivers and there is no need for major doubts or huge criticism, but it is never important what the manager has in his head before pre-season, it’s the reality that counts. Every day in training and matches like this count and from there we go,” he told reporters after the game.
