Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has warned political office seekers against using the Eid festivities to lunch their campaigns or display posters, saying such actions are clear violations of the electoral Act. The Governor also reinforced the ban on placing posters at Eid praying grounds and at other ceremonies such as the traditional Hawan Daushe at the Emir’s Palace. A statement by the governor, signed by the Commissioner for Information, Malam Muhammad Garba, Friday night said such acts are not only distractions but also in violation of the electoral Act. He said Sallah festivities are not political but solely religious and cultural gatherings aimed at showcasing the rich cultural heritage where people of different political leanings and foreign visitors attend. The governor charged security agencies to take appropriate measures against any person who breaches the prevailing peace during festivities.
