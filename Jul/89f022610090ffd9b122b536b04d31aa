The 2023 presidential candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC), Omoyele Sowore has vowed that he would probe all past leaders involved in corruption to ensure that all looted funds are recovered. This is coming hours after the Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi said he has no plan to probe any past leader if he succeeds President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. Countering Obi’s position, Sowore, in a tweet on his verified Twitter handle on Saturday, said if the present administration can retrieve stolen money from late Sanni Abacha, others can be probed. He wrote, “As President of Nigeria, I will probe and retrieve every penny stolen by past Nigerian rulers, those who’ve murdered innocents and deprived them of a bright future. “If we could be retrieving money from dead and buried Sanni Abacha, we should retrieve from living legendary thieves”.
