The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, have been severely criticized over the 2023 presidency. A Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa lambasted the duo on Tuesday. The legal practitioner noted that “undue and unbridled desperation for power leads to ineffectiveness”. “This has been the case with (President) Buhari and so it shall be with Atiku, who has lusted for power beyond human understanding”, he said in a strong statement. Adegboruwa said in order to satisfy Atiku’s political ambition, “PDP ate its own vomit, threw away its own constitution and rejected the justice embedded in the power rotation doctrine”. “If PDP will not honour its own Constitution, how can it be trusted with the Constitution of Nigeria?”, the lawyer quipped. He said in seeking to succeed Buhari, another Northerner, Atiku and his supporters do not believe in the plurality and unity of Nigeria. Adegboruwa added that in his quest to take over from an incumbent of the same faith as him, Atiku does not believe in the nation’s secularity. The statement warned that an Atiku presidency will translate to 16 years of unbroken Northern presidency, lead to more agitations and may snowball into disintegration. He further said it would also amount to 16 years of Muslim presidency, facilitate more terrorist attacks, marginalization of people of other faiths and possible increased persecution. “Having regard to our collective experience under the inglorious Obasanjo/Atiku regime, an Atiku presidency will translate into loss of national assets, mortgaging of commonwealth”, the SAN added. Adegboruwa told Nigerians that Atiku cannot be the option in 20023 and urged “all people of good conscience to reject PDP and its leprous ticket”.
