The Yoruba socio-cultural organization, Afenifere, on Friday, slammed the Federal Government over its plan to ban motorcycles and mining activities in Nigeria. Afenifere said such a move had shown that the Federal Government lacked deep and scientific thinking on how decisions were made. Jare Ajayi, the spokesman of the organization, said the Federal Government was wrong in its proposed decision. In a statement, Ajayi said: “The plan by the federal government to ban commercial motorcycle and mining activities purportedly to curb insecurity is another evidence that deep or scientific thinking does not characterize how decisions are arrived at in the corridors of power.” He noted that the government was wrong on limiting logistical sources of terrorists to mining and commercial motorcycling, stressing that, “it is hardly surprising therefore that its prescription is so fatally wrong!” The Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, had disclosed the planned move yesterday in Abuja. Malami said the proposed move was aimed at cutting off terrorists’ source of funding. “Placing a ban on the use of motorcycles and mining activities will cut the supply of logistics to the terrorists,” Malami had said. However, the Afenifere spokesman said that motorcycle riding and mining had been in “existence long before terrorism reared its head. So these could not have been the leif motif of terrorism.” Ajayi added: “Also, to suppose that banning these activities would put a stop to terrorism is not only a wishful thinking, it amounts to an induced self-delusion that can only complicate the ailment that one is suffering from. Pursuing that line is leaving the substance to chase the shadow.”
