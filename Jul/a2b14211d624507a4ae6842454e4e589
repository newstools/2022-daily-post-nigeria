A socio-political analyst, Deji Adeyanju, has suggested why Bola Tinubu, the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, APC, is trying to pick a Northern Muslim as his running mate. Adeyanju said most Northerners don’t consider Tinubu a Muslim. In a tweet, the Abuja-based activist noted that Tinubu is trying to gain the trust of Northerners by picking a Muslim as his running mate. He noted that this is the real reason the APC presidential candidate wants to ignore the accepted norm of balancing a joint ticket with a Christian. “Many people in the North don’t see Tinubu as a Muslim. This is why he is trying to prove to them they can trust him by picking a Muslim VP. “And the real reason he wants to ignore the accepted norm of balancing a joint ticket with a Christian,” Adeyanju tweeted. Tinubu had submitted the name of Kabiru Masari to the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, as a placeholder. Amid the controversy surrounding the selection of Masari, who hails from Katsina State, as a placeholder, Tinubu had said he was searching for a running mate.
