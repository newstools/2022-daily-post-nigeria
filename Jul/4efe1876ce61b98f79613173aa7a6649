The Catholic Church has described the bishops who attended the unveiling of Kashim Shettima as the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu’s running mate as fake. Rev. Fr. Patrick Alumuku, spokesman for the Catholic Church Headquarters in Abuja, said those bishops were not their representatives. Alumuku stressed that Tinubu’s campaign team hired the fake bishops to attend the event. “We have seen the photos circulating online, they are not Catholic bishops. The Catholic Church did not send any representation to the event held today by Bola Tinubu and his running mate Kashim Shettima. “If you look at the manner the imposters dressed and conducted themselves, you will see they are not Catholic Church officials” he told newsmen. On Wednesday, APC had unveiled Shettima as Tinubu’s running mate. This was against the clamour of Nigerians calling for a Christian running mate. Despite such calls, Tinubu had opted for a Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket.
