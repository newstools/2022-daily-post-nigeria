Barely three days after a boat accident occurred around the Ikorodu area of Lagos State, where two passengers died, another boat accident took place on Friday night around the Mile 2 area. This was disclosed in a statement issued on Saturday by Mrs Sarat Braimah, Lagos Area Manager, the National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA). She informed that 16 passengers on board the ill-fated boat were yet to be accounted for. “At about 7.45 p.m., on July 8, the National Inland Waterways Authority and the Lagos State Waterways Authority received a distress call of an incident on the waterways. “A W19 passenger Fibre boat carrying about 16 people capsized along the Ojo area of the state. “The boat from Mile 2 to Ibeshe in the Ojo axis broke the waterways rules of late travelling by setting sail at 7.45 p.m.,” she said. Braimah said the tide of the water drifted the boat to a stationary barge, which caused it to overturn. “It is said that all passengers on board, including children, were not all wearing their life jackets.
