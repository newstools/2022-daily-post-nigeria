Newly-signed Manchester United star, Tyrell Malacia has revealed that former Arsenal star Robin van Persie inspired him to play for the Red Devils. The 22-year-old Malacia was brought in from the Netherlands and had his United medical on Monday at the club’s Carrington training ground. He was signed for a £13 million transfer from Feyenoord. He told De Telegraaf: “I always followed [Man Utd] because Robin van Persie played there as a Feyenoord player. That’s why I got an extra feeling with that.” The Holland international full-back will also be familiar with his new boss, Erik ten Hag. On the Dutchman, Malacia said: “Mr Ten Hag is a very good trainer and also a warm person, so I had a good conversation with him and I have a very good feeling with him.” The defender said he is looking forward to working with Ten Hag because he’ll learn a lot from his compatriot.
