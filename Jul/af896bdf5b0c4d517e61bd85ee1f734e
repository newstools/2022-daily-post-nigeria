The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has claimed ‘Fulani-controlled’ military are responsible for the alleged killing of innocent people in Ogbaru and Nnewi South Local Government Areas of Anambra State. IPOB has now asked Anambra State Governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, to speak up against the killings. According to the secessionist group, the governor’s “silence” showed that he is allegedly competing with his Imo State counterpart, Hope Uzodimma, in using the military to kill his people. This was contained in a statement signed by IPOB’s Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, on Sunday. Powerful admitted that although “there are some pockets of petty criminals in the State as obtainable elsewhere in Nigeria, “it is not enough reason for the Nigerian military to randomly be slaughtering our people like chickens.” According to him, “The military started shooting innocent people sporadically on the road and some were gunned down in their homes in Ogbaru and Nnewi South. “Soludo are you aware of the military exercise? Is this kind of military depopulation of your people part of the deal you entered with the enemies of Ndigbo before being voted into office as Anambra governor last November?” The group added that IPOB and the Eastern Security Network (ESN) operatives were doing their best to stop those perpetrating criminalities in the region.
