The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar has reacted to calls for the National Chairman of the party, Dr Iyorchia Ayu to resign. DAILY POST recalls that sequel to the selection of Governor Ifeanyi Okowa as running mate of Atiku, members of the party who are loyalists of the Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike had demanded Ayu’s resignation. The call for his resignation came when Senator Ayu was alleged to have been using his position as national chairman to undermine the likes of Fayose, Ortom and others who earlier recommended Wike as the party’s vice presidential candidate. Speaking on the issue, Atike, who featured on Arise TV programme, Morning Show on Friday, said the party chairman will automatically step down when he emerge as the next Nigerian president. He said, “Immediately I win this election, Senator Ayu will automatically step down. We have had issues like this before. It is not the first time PDP is having such crisis”. Atiku insisted that Ayu will remain in power until he wins the election, stressing that there has always been balancing of positions in the party. He said when the President happens to emerge from the North, the position of chairman will automatically be zoned to South.
