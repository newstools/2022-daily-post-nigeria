The House of Representatives has resolved to set up an ad hoc committee to investigate the shortage of booklets and sharp practices at passport offices. The House also asked the Nigerian Immigration Service to stop the biometric capturing policy to end the backlog of international passports. Furthermore, the House urged the NIS to immediately purchase more machines to aid the process. These resolutions followed a motion moved by Fred Agbesi from Bayelsa State on Thursday. In his motion, Agbedi said applying for an international passport has become frustrating for most Nigerians. He noted that due to sharp practices by officials of immigration services, Nigerians still have to wait for months to get passports. Agbedi added that the decision of the federal government to produce 30,000 e-passports has not addressed the challenges. “In recent times, the process of applying for Nigerian passport has become so frustrating as the process is bedeviled with delays occasioned by the shortage of passport booklets. “These have brought about sharp practices as well as rip off charges, to the detriment of our people within and outside the country,” the motion reads in part. The ad hoc committee is to report to the House in eight weeks.
