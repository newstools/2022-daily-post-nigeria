Actor Yomi Fabiyi says his colleague, Olanrewaju James, aka Baba Ijesha, has the right to appeal the judgement of the Ikeja court which sentenced him to jail over sexual assault of a minor. Recall that the embattled Nollywood actor, Olanrewaju James, alias Baba Ijesha, was on Thursday found guilty and sentence by an Ikeja Special Offences Court for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl. Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo, in a two-hour judgement, sentenced Baba Ijesha to 16years in jail. Speaking after the court verdict, Fabiyi on his Instagram, said Baba Ijesha has the right to appeal the judgement after he pleaded not guilty. His post read: “Baba Ijesha was not NOT found guilty of The defilement (rape) with CAR KEY as charged (1&6) for lack of evidence, which he still denied ever committing but has been found guilty of few other charges bothering on sexual assault.” Fabiyi noted that despite his support for Baba Ijesha, he is agains abuse of children and will never support such. He, however, stated that parents of such children abused should be punished equally for parental negligence. “CHILDREN ARE MEANT TO BE PROTECTED. And I will insist that PARENTAL NEGLIGENCE is equally punishable under section 30(3) Child Rights Act. It is an imprisonment for ten years! “I’m still committed to the frontiers of HUMAN RIGHTS and that all accused are innocent until proven guilty by the court of law. I thank the JUDGE for not punishing the defendant (Baba Ijesha) before today, until verdict is reached.”
