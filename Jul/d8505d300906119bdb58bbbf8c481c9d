The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Senator Abdullahi Adamu has attributed the party’s failure to retain power in Osun State via the just concluded election to the crisis rocking the ruling party. Recall that Gboyega Oyetola of the APC in the July 16 governorship election was defeated by Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democracy Party (PDP). Adeleke secured 403,371 votes while Oyetola trailed with 375,027 votes. Reacting, Adamu who spoke with BBC Hausa, said the outcome of the Osun election cannot determine the party’s performance in the forthcoming general election. According to him, the party never had a sign of losing the election, saying there was massive support. He said: “We lost the race not because we are incapable but because of the crisis within. We had a massive gathering of supporters a few days before the election in Osogbo. No one could ever anticipate that we would lose the election. “Osun defeat doesn’t in any way mean that we will lose at the general election. We only lost one state out of the 22 we have; you see, we are still strong.”
