The Plateau State Police Command has foiled an attempt to attack and kidnap some residents in the Bassa Local Government Area of the state. Alabo Alfred, the spokesman for the command, while making the revelation on Saturday in a statement, explained that the development came following an attack which occurred in Fobur community, Jos East Local Government Area of the state less than 24 hours leading to the killing of five persons by gunmen. He stated that to enable the residents of the state to respond quickly whenever there is an incident in their areas, they were advised to get the phone numbers of security officers within their areas and ensure the information is passed timely. The statement further stated, “In his bid to continue to fight crime and criminality on the Plateau, the Plateau State Commissioner of Police, CP Bartolomeo Onyeka psc (+), has recorded another milestone achievement by repelling an attack from men of the underworld in Bassa LGA.” The statement explained that on 22nd July, 2022, at about 2300hrs, a distress call was received by the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) Bassa Division, SP James Yakubu, from a concerned citizen that some unknown gunmen suspected to be kidnappers were operating at the residence of one Mark Inkasu. It added that upon receiving the report, the DPO mobilised his men and raced to the scene, saying that on sighting the patrol vehicle, the hoodlums started shooting at them. The statement added that following the professional conduct of the DPO and his team, they engaged them fearlessly and sensing the danger that was about to befall them, the hoodlums escaped into a nearby bush with bullet wounds. The CP therefore enjoined the residents of Bassa to go about their lawful activities as normalcy has since been restored in the area and thanked all the community security organisations within the area for giving the police the timely information that has helped in repelling the criminals. The Commissioner of Police condoled with the people of Fobur town, Fusa village and the families of the five persons who were killed by yet-to-be-identified persons at Jos East LGA on the 21st July, 2022, assuring the families of the deceased and the entire local government that efforts are on top gear to arrest the perpetrators of the dastardly act for them to face justice and bring an end to the menace in the state.
