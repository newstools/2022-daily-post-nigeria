The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in Taraba State has organised a prayer session against bandits in the state. Leading the congregation at the prayer organised by the Teckan/Eckwa block of CAN, Rev. Micah Dopah said the aim of the prayer rally was to cripple the inhumane acts of bandits which have led to deaths of residents, kidnappings and other vices across the nooks and crannies of the state and the country at large. He lamented that Nigerians were almost submitting to the alternative of dividing the country due to the belief that a section is oppressing the majority “The decision of this prayer service after three-day fasting is to provoke the Holy Spirit to rise and strike the enemies of progressives in Taraba and in our dear country Nigerian. ”The church is out to provoke the Holy Spirit to rise against those perpetrating crime in the Nigerian society and doing all within their powers to ensure disunity among Nigerians”. The cleric also frowned at those agitating for the same religion ticket for the 2023 elections. saying such an idea if allowed to see the light of day would spell doom for the Nigerian nation. He stressed that “it would go as far as bringing disunity among members of the two major religions in Nigeria.” Some worshippers who spoke with DAILY POST on the rationale behind the Special prayer session said the idea has become necessary following the ongoing daily Killings in Taraba and the country as a whole. They believe it has become necessary to seek God’s intervention to have a free, fair and credible general poll come next year.
