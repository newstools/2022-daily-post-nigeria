The leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, has disclosed how the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, may pave the way for the victory of his counterpart from the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu. Primate Ayodele disclosed that Atiku will win the 2023 presidential election. He, however, noted that if Atiku and PDP fail to strategize properly, they would hand over the 2023 presidential victory to Tinubu. Addressing journalists in Lagos on Saturday, the clergyman warned that Atiku, Tinubu, and the Labour Party, LP, presidential candidate, Peter Obi can’t resolve Nigeria’s problems. He insisted that Tinubu can only win the 2023 presidential election through rigging. According to Ayodele: “Not Atiku or Peter Obi can make Nigeria any better; I have not seen any fantastic candidate that can turn Nigeria around. “But one person must be there no matter the situation. “Tinubu and APC can only win by rigging, I don’t hate him, but I’m speaking as the prophet of God. If Tinubu becomes president, Nigeria will be worst than Buhari’s government; Nigeria will be stagnant, a failed nation, a disgraced nation. “Tinubu will become a pandemic, disaster, calamity on Nigeria; mind you, I don’t hate him, but I’m speaking as a prophet of God. “The election is for PDP, but if they fail to restrategize properly, then they will give it to Tinubu.”
