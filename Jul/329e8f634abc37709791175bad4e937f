Aloy Ejimakor, Special Counsel to Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has frowned at the alleged ethnic imbalance in security formations in the southeast. Ejimakor said the Southeast must unite against such ethnic imbalance that has left the region vulnerable. He lamented that the Southeast is being taken over by security men driven by sectarian impulses. Ejimakor was reacting to a report that Anambra communities accused the Nigerian Army of labelling their youths as IPOB and operatives of the Eastern Security Network, ESN. In a tweet, the Special Counsel wrote: “SE must unite against the persisting ethnic imbalance in the security formations in SE. “It has left SE vulnerable to a posse of security personnel, driven by sectarian impulses to levy #massacres without any compatriot empathy. “ESN/IPOB is merely an excuse. SE leaders, ahoy!”
