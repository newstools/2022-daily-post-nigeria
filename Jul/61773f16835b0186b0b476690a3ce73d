Controversial Islamic cleric, Ahmed Gumi has said the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu’s choice of running mate has nothing to do with religion. DAILY POST reports that the media space has been flooded with reactions of many stakeholders who are registering their grievances on Tinubu’s decision to pick a fellow Muslim, Kashim Shettima as his running mate for the 2023 presidential elections. Many party members have continued to resign their membership of the party since the announcement was made on Sunday. However, some party members have argued that there is nothing wrong with the decision, stressing that the only way the party can emerge victorious in 2023 is to have a Muslim vice presidential candidate. Similarly, Gumi, in an exclusive chat with DAILY POST on Tuesday, said the Muslim-Muslim ticket was just a strategy to win the election. According to him, the electorates, particularly the aggrieved ones, have the right to vote for their preferred candidate. He said, “It has nothing to do with religion. It’s pure vote-getting strategy and nothing more. It now depends on the voter to choose from a wide range of choices”.
