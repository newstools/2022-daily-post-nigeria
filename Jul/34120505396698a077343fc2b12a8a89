Super Eagles forward, Chidera Ejuke has suspended his contract with CSKA Moscow as he looks set to finalise a loan move to Hertha Berlin. The Russian club confirmed this in a statement posted on their website. CSKA however frowned on FIFA’s statutes, which Ejuke exploited to make the move. “Striker Chidera Ejuke and midfielder Arnor Sigurdsson have used the temporary employment rules, which were approved by The Bureau of the FIFA Council, and suspended their respective deals with PFC CSKA until 30 June 2023. “PFC CSKA regrets the players’ decision, which was taken despite the club’s effort and their contract duties. As was announced earlier, PFC CSKA plans to fill in lawsuits to defend its interests against FIFA’s decision, which we consider discriminatory and contrary to the statutes of that organisation,” the statement read. FIFA has given foreign players in Russia special permission to leave their clubs. This follows Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing war in Eastern Europe.
