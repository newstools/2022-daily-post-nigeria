Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has admitted that he might not sign players that are yet to take the COVID-19 vaccination. Tuchel is without N’Golo Kante and Ruben Loftus-Cheek for the Blues’ preseason tour of the US. Both Kante and Loftus-Cheek are yet to be vaccinated and therefore unable to travel. The pair were instead in an Under-23 line-up taking on Boreham Wood on Friday. Tuchel said: “I knew some players who I would also take without vaccination. I have to say. But yes, it is a part of daily life at the moment.” When pressed on whether a player’s decision over taking the vaccine has come into his thinking, he added: “Yes, it has to.” Tuchel has already brought in Raheem Sterling and Kalidou Koulibaly from Manchester City and Napoli this summer.
