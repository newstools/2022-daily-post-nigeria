Chelsea forward, Timo Werner, has reacted to the club’s latest new signing. Chelsea on Saturday morning announced the signing of defender, Kalidou Koulibaly. Koulibaly joined the Blues from Serie A club, Napoli, after the completion of a €40million deal. Chelsea were in need of reinforcements at the back after the departures of Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen on free transfers to Real Madrid and Barcelona, respectively. However, reacting to the signing of Koulibaly, Werner said the Senegalese international would give Thomas Tuchel’s side strength at the back, adding that it is exactly what Chelsea needs. “I think he’s a brilliant defender,” Werner told Sky Sports. “He will give us the strength at the back we need after a lot of players left us in defence. A very good signing for the club. From what I saw when I played against him, he brings exactly what we need.”
