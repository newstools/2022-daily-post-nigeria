Former Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, has said that he was sad after the club’s former midfielder, Jack Wilshere, retired from football. Wilshere on Friday announced his retirement from football at the age of just 30. He called time on his career after Danish Superliga side AGF decided not to renew his contract for the new season earlier this week. The former England international made his debut for Arsenal in 2008. Reacting, Wenger, who gave Wilshere his debut at Arsenal, paid tribute to his former player. “Well, for me, it’s a sad moment because Jack is an exceptional football player,” Wenger told Sky Sports. “He was brave, he was talented, he was not scared of anybody. Which is why we thought he could start at a very young age. Straight away, he showed he had the ability to be a main player.”
