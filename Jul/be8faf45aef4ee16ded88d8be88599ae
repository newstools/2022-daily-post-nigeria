The Federal Government of Nigeria has commenced the training of officers across the country on conflict management, human and police rights. The training organized by the Nigeria Police Trust Fund (NPTF), kicked off in Abuja, the nation’s capital. Minister of Police Affairs Muhammad Dingyadi was reprsented by the Ministry’s Director of General Services Edenmaya Brayia. Dingyadi said the seminar would deepen relations between the police, communities, citizens, and harness human intelligence for crime control. The minister assured that the government was keen on improving officers’ skills, knowledge, job performance, and keep them updated in modern policing techniques. “I have no doubt that at the end of this training, you will come out reinvigorated and repositioned for more efficient delivery of your very challenging task of securing the nation”, he told the participants. Dinyadi said police personnel attending the capacity-building would also be tutored on how to ensure adequate security during the 2023 general elections. NPTF Director of Planning, Research, and Statistics, Muhammad Yahaya said the training was contained in the 2021 budget appropriated by the National Assembly and signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari. “The training is to enhance the operational police preparedness to effectively tackle security challenges in order to secure the lives and properties of citizens”, Yahaya added.
