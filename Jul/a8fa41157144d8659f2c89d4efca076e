A 20-year-old housewife, Caroline Barka, has allegedly stabbed her 38-year-old husband, Barka Dauda, to death. Caroline Barka, a resident of Angwan Tamiya, Madagali Local Government Area of Adamawa State, is said to have engaged her late husband in a fight following an argument. The argument was said to have ensued between them after the deceased returned home drunk and fell on their one-year old baby who was in bed. Angered by his drunkenness, habitual late nights, and failure to provide basic necessities as a husband, the suspect and the deceased had a fight which resulted in her stabbing the husband, a source close to the family explained. He was rushed to the hospital where he was confirmed dead. The Adamawa State Police Command, which first disclosed the incident, said in a statement that on July 22, Friday, its operatives apprehended the suspect over the deadly fight with her husband. “The suspect was apprehended by the police in Madagali Local Government Area following a report received from a relative of the deceased. “Investigation so far reveals that the suspect, being a nursing mother, had a child with the deceased after two years of marriage,” said the statement which was made available to newsmen by police image maker, SP Suleiman Nguroje.
