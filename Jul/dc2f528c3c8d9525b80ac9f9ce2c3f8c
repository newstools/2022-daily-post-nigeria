Opoola Mujidat, a 27-year-old drugs queen, was on Sunday apprehended by operatives of the National Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) at the departure hall of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Ikeja, Lagos, for planting drugs concealed in fetish bowls containing scary native black soap and sponge on two Oman-bound male passengers. Femi Babafemi, spokesman of NDLEA, in a statement explained that the two men, Raji Kazeem and Akinbobola Omoniyi, were travelling to Oman on an Ethiopian Airlines flight on Monday, July 11, when they were intercepted by NDLEA operatives at the airport. According to the statement, “A search of their luggage revealed wraps of cannabis sativa hidden in bowls of native black soap and sponge packed into a bag containing food items, which Kazeem was carrying.” The statement further explained that the anti-narcotic officers were alerted by Kazeem and Omoniyi that Mujidat, who was still within the vicinity, gave the bag containing the illicit substance to them at the airport and she was immediately apprehended. She was said to have accepted responsibility, explaining that she brought the luggage for the two passengers to give to her husband in Oman. The statement added that Mujidat, who hails from Oyo East LGA in Oyo State, confessed during a preliminary interview that the bag containing the food items was packed by her with different items, including the black soap used to conceal the illicit substance.
