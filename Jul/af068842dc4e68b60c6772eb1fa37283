Presidential candidate of the Action Alliance (AA), Hamza Al-Mustapha, has insisted he does not have any regrets working with late Head of State, Sani Abacha. Al-Mustapha worked as the Aide-de-Camp (ADC) to the late dictator. Abacha was Nigeria’s president from 1993 until his sudden death on June 8, 1998. Speaking on Channels Television on Friday, Al-Mustapha who was accused of plotting at least four coups from prison, insisted that serving Abacha was part of his job description. “I have no regrets. When you join the Military, you should be open-minded to work anywhere. “You can be in the worst part of the country or world. It is my experience. “My personal destiny took me to where I served. Wherever I serve, you will see the distinct difference. “I have done so all my life and career. “I never canvassed to be posted anywhere. They know what they saw in me and posted me to everywhere they took me. And I gave my life and made sacrifices that are indelible in the history of Military.” Al-Mustapha won the AA presidential ticket in June ahead of the 2023 general election. He won the party’s primary with 506 votes, defeating his only opponent, Samson Odupitan
