Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the leadership of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Benue South, has taken its final decision on the running mate of the party’s governorship candidate. The former Minister of Agriculture, Audu Ogbe-led leadership narrowed down its decision to three persons. Rev Fr. Hyacinth Alia is the governorship candidate of the APC in Benue State. The deputy governorship seat was zoned to Benue South Senatorial District, otherwise known as Zone C following Alia’s emergence. In a bid to present a formidable running mate to Alia, the leadership of the party earlier trimmed down the list of those aspiring for the position to just three. After a series of meetings and consultations, leaders of the party in Benue South said the three nominees would decide among themselves and present one person for the deputy governorship job. Among the nominees are former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Barr. Sam Ode, Dr. Isaac Egboja and Benjamin Abuh Omakolo. In a statement jointly Chief Audu Ogbeh, APC Benue South Leader and Chief John Ochoga, Chairman, Zone C Elders’ Forum, the party said the choice of the trio follows a series of meetings and consultations.
