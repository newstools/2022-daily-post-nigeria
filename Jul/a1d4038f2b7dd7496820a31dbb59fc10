Justice C. L. Dabup of the Plateau State High Court in Jos is set to deliver judgement in the trial of ex-Plateau governor, Jonah Jang. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) is also prosecuting a former cashier in the office of the Secretary to the State Government, Yusuf Pam. On Thursday, Justice Dialup adjourned after the adoption of final written addresses by both the prosecution and the defence counsel. Jang and Pam are facing trial for alleged criminal breach of trust and misappropriation of State funds to the tune of N6.3billion. Jang’s counsel, Mike Ozekhome, who adopted his final written address, urged the court to discharge and acquit his client. The Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) informed the court that Jang pleaded not guilty to the charges preferred against him. Ozekhome said the case lacked merit and that the prosecution did not prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. Pam’s lawyer, S.G. Odey, while adopting his final written address, urged the court to discharge and acquit his client on all charges. Prosecution counsel, Rotimi Jacobs (SAN) however, urged the court to consider the evidence of all the fourteen witnesses before it. Justice Dabup informed the counsels that the High Court will be going on vacation and they consented that the judge could deliver judgment during the period. The judge adjourned the case for judgment to a date that will be communicated to the parties.
