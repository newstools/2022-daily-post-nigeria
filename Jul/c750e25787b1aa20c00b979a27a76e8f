Rising from the ashes of lockdown, social distancing, and the faceless mask, TILX, The Ibejii Live Experience (TILX) is back. The double Headies nominee will be serenading fans with Afro-soul sound that speaks to love, life, societal ills, etc. Gonto, one of the songs to be performed at the live experience, is the first single by the renowned British/Nigerian afro-soul singer, composer, Ibejii, to receive a nomination for a 2022 Headies Award in the category of Best Alternative song. It is an afro-orchestral song that transports the listener on a journey that encapsulates the callousness of the wealthy as well as the bravery of a new generation of believers. The second nomination, “Intermission” is in the category of Best Alternative Album. The six-track album is a collection of songs with themes about the issues faced by Nigerian youth, who have publicly protested in the last 18 months after being the target of police intimidation, harassment, and even torture. TILX, Ibejii’s celebration of those, like him, who live on the sunny side of life, is indulgence in pure, true, unadulterated sound. It is platform for letting the spirit run free, a place to meet, lose and find self; to embrace the fulness of ‘me’. TILX: The Phoenix is 2022 edition of this most seminal event. With TILX: The Phoenix, Ibejii returns to belt out songs from his wide catalogue, including songs from newly released Post-19, a 7-track album released in celebration of life. TILX: The Phoenix is a global line up of events, beginning with a Freedom event holding at Terra Kulture, Lagos on 10th July, 2022 from 7.00pm prompt. Rise with TILX: The Phoenix. See you there. @Ibejiimusic
