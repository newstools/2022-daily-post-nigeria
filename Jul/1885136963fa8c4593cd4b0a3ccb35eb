Arsenal, on Friday, became the biggest spenders in the Premier League this summer so far. This follows the £32 million signing of Oleksandr Zinchenko from Manchester City. The Gunners have now spent £121.5 million on new players ahead of the new season, according to Sky Sport. They are followed by Tottenham Hotspur (£115 million), Manchester City (£101.1 million), Leeds United (£95.4 million), Liverpool (£91.5 million) and Chelsea (£81.5 million). Arsenal could be toppled by London rivals, Chelsea, who are set to seal a deal for Sevilla defender Jules Kounde. The Blues have reportedly struck a £55 million fee for Kounde and have offered the player a five-year contract.
