Super Falcons defender, Osinachi Ohale is on cloud nine after she was named Woman of the Match in the team’s emphatic 4-0 win against the Swallows of Burundi on Sunday night. Ohale, who has played every minute of Super Falcons’ three games at the 2022 Africa Women’s Cup of Nations, put up a spirited display in the encounter. The Alaves of Spain centre-back was picked ahead of her teammate, Rasheedat Ajibade, who scored a goal and provided an assist in the game. Peace Efih and Mexico-based forward, Uchenna Kanu were also on target for the Super Falcons against the Swallows. “This is the first time that I have ever received a Woman of the Match Award since I started playing for Nigeria in 2010 and it really feels so good,” Ohale told CAF Online. “When I remember all the hard work that my teammates and I have put in, it makes me smile.” The Super Falcons will take on the Indomitable Lioness of Cameroon in the quarter-finals on Thursday.
