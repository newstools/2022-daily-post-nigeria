President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday in Abuja revealed that his desire for Nigeria is that the 2023 elections should clearly mark the commencement of the institutional strength of the country’s electoral body in conducting acceptable, credible, and violence-free elections. Buhari disclosed this while receiving a delegation from Nasarawa State today. He told the high-powered delegation led by Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, that the Electoral Act, signed by him this year, was an attestation of the fulfilment of the administration’s determination and commitment to the tenets of the rule of law. This was disclosed in a statement by Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President. He said, “On the issues of credible, free, and fair elections in the country, I have always re-assured my listeners both at home and abroad that my personal desire and indeed the priority of this administration is to bequeath to our nation an irreversible political process that continues to be both democratic and acceptable to the people. ‘‘My desire for our nation is that the 2023 elections should clearly mark the commencement of the institutional strength of our electoral body in conducting acceptable, credible, and violence-free elections. “The forthcoming general elections will provide us with the opportunity to convince the electorate of the need for continuity to enable our party to consolidate on our achievements in the last seven years.”
