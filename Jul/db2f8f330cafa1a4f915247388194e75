Borno State Governor, Babagana Zulum, has commended the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, for picking Kashim Shettima as his running mate. Zulum said Tinubu made the wisest choice by picking Shettima as his running mate. He promised to campaign vigorously to ensure Tinubu emerged as Nigeria’s next president. In a statement he signed, Zulum said: “Earlier today, I received with the greatest joy, the announcement of my mentor, His Excellency, Senator Kashim Shettima as the Vice Presidential candidate of our party, the APC and insha’Allah, the next Vice President of the Federal Republic under His Excellency, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, our incoming President. “It has been my greatest wish that Kashim Shettima gets this elevation that he so much deserves as one of Nigeria’s highly patriotic leaders. “For me, and I am sure for many leaders and members of the APC, Tinubu’s choice of HE Kashim Shettima is the wisest choice at this point in time. Zulum described Shettima as a patriotic individual with a deep sense of the country’s economy. He assured Nigerians that the Borno Central Senator believes in the country’s Unity. He said: “Shettima is extremely patriotic. He believes so much in the Unity of this country, and he has proved it on a number of occasions. “Above everything else, Tinubu has chosen for Nigeria an incoming Vice President with very deep knowledge not only of the Nigerian economy (challenges and prospects) but also of the world. “I have more to say on this unique leader but I will reserve them for campaigns.”
