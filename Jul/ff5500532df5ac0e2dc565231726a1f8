Arsenal midfielder, Omari Hutchinson, has sent a message of thanks to the club and its supporters after deciding to leave the Gunners and move to Chelsea. Hutchinson’s transfer came as a surprise, having been tipped for a big future at Arsenal, particularly after an outstanding campaign last season for the youth team. The 18-year-old’s performances saw him called up to Mikel Arteta’s Premier League squad during the run-in, though he never made an appearance for the first team. Despite deciding to leave Arsenal, Hutchinson is very grateful for his time at Emirates. He penned a heartfelt message to supporters after the move to Chelsea was confirmed. Writing on his Instagram account on Saturday, Hutchinson said: “Dear fans, it’s time to say goodbye. “My experience with Arsenal has been a fantastic and memorable one. “I will always remember my time here and the beautiful journey it has taken me on. “This will be one to remember and never to forget. “Arsenal made me feel most welcomed and respected, so huge thank you to all the staff and coaches and my teammates – it’s been a real pleasure.” “Words cannot describe how I value, respect and love you all!”
