A human rights activist in Kaduna State, Dr. Shuaibu Murtala has expressed fear following the coordinated attack on Kuje prison and the convoy of President Muhammadu Buhari in his home state by suspected bandits. Speaking to DAILY POST, in Kaduna, Murtala said if bandits can attack a prison in the federal capital, without fear, then Nigeria as a whole is in trouble and at the mercy of bandits. Dr. Murtala while wondering why bandits dictate to the federal government without arrests by security operatives, warned that soon, bandits will begin to vie for political offices. “Bandits’ activities have reached a point where they will bring their own candidates as Governor, House of Assembly, National Assembly and nobody will question them because they have guns, knives and all it takes to win in an election.” He said Alleging that the Kaduna-Abuja train kidnappers could be responsible for the Kuje prison attack, Murtala said “these criminals have told the federal government what they want. The federal government has agreed to their conditions as to hasten the release of their comrades in various detention centres across the country. But the Federal government kept moving slowly. Now, it’s assumed they have struck, released some of their colleagues, the lives of those in the den are at risk.”
