Arsenal goalkeeper, Aaron Ramsdale has tipped Gabriel Jesus to bring positive changes at the Emirates Stadium. Jesus made a £45m move from Manchester City to the Emirates Stadium this summer and has hit the ground running with many preseason goals. Ramsdale told Sky Sports that the Brazil international is “a great guy,” who chats with everyone and “always has a smile on his face.” Jesus helped Manchester City win four league titles, three league cups and the FA Cup during his five-year spell at the Etihad. England international goalkeeper, Ramsdale hopes that Jesus will help Arsenal lift silverware and finish in a better position in the Premier League next season. “He’s got amazing talent and he also knows how to win, so I’ve been trying to pick his brains. “He’s not going to change everything at this football club in terms of winning things, but if we can take 1% out of his mentality and how he plays, then it’s only going to benefit us,” he added.
