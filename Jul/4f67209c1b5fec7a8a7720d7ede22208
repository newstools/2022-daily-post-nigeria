Former Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper, Paul Robinson has told Manchester United to sign another number nine this ongoing summer transfer window. Robinson believes Man United’s current number nine cannot be relied on going forward. He also urged the club to address Cristiano Ronaldo’s current situation at Old Trafford. DAILY POST reports that Martial spent the second half of last season on loan at Sevilla after struggling for playing time at Manchester United. Man United initially planned to sell the Frenchman when he returned from Spain this summer. However, Martial has been in fine form for Erik ten Hag’s side during the pre-season, scoring three goals and providing one assist from the club’s four exhibition matches so far. “That surprises me. Martial has had his chances in the first team and the Premier League. Let’s be honest, pre-season games are very different to actual games. They are played at a very different tempo. The importance of games is very different,” Robinson told Football Insider. “Man United have a big couple of weeks ahead before the season starts and the window closes. They need to address Ronaldo’s future and they need to sign a number nine. Yes, Martial has had a good pre-season. He has started well. But he has had his chance. “He has proved that he can’t be relied on over the last few seasons. I’m sure United fans would be disappointed if Ten Hag decided to go with Martial as their number nine next year.”
