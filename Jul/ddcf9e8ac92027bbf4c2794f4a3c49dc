Ajax star, Lisandro Martinez, has told his club that he wants to leave for the Premier League, amid interest from Manchester United. This claim was made by respected football transfer expert, Fabrizio Romano, in a tweet via his Twitter handle on Monday. According to Romano, Arsenal is “still there fighting” with Man United over Martinez’s signature. “Lisandro Martínez, back in Holland today – he’s been very clear with Ajax telling the club that he only wants to leave to try his first Premier League experience,” He tweeted. “Manchester United are pushing as ten Hag wants Lisandro as a priority – Arsenal, still there fighting.” DAILY POST reports that Martinez is keen on a reunion with Man United manager Erik ten Hag, who managed him during their time together at Ajax.
