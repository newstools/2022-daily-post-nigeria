Paris Saint-Germain forward, Lionel Messi, doesn’t want his friend and fellow teammate Neymar Jr. to leave the club this summer amid interest from Chelsea, according to La Nacion (via Le10Sport). Messi wants Neymar to stay at the Parc des Princes beyond this summer, having spent only one season together in Paris. However, It’s not known if Messi’s opinion would matter in Neymar’s future at PSG. Neymar is facing an uncertain future at PSG as the Brazilian international is linked with a move away from the club to Chelsea. PSG are open to selling Neymar on loan should the club receive a good offer for the 30-year-old. Neymar joined PSG back in 2017 from Barcelona for a world-record fee of €222 million.
