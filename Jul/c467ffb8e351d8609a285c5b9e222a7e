Prince Uche Secondus, a former National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP, says the victory of Sen. Ademola Adeleke at the Saturday election shows Osun people have taken their collective destiny into their own hands. Secondus, in a message by his Special Adviser on Media, Ike Abonyi, in Abuja, said that Adeleke’s victory was a clear affirmation and demonstration of the voters’ goodwill in appreciation of the efforts of the Adelekes in the development of the State. The former Chairman commended the voters for standing up for democracy by ensuring that no one else intervened in their will. “By this brave and courageous act, Osun people have shown their determination to take their collective destiny in their own hands, and for this, PDP and all lovers of democracy are so proud of them,” he said. Secondus urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the various security operatives to ensure that 2023 also reflects the will of the people.
