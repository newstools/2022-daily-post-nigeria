Owing to emerging security threats from terrorists, the Federal Government has directed the National Examination Council to hasten the conduct of examinations for final-year students. It has also ordered the immediate closure of one of its colleges, the Federal Government College Kwali, located in Kwali Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja over similar security threats. Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu gave the directive in the early hours of Monday, saying the closure became necessary following a security breach on Sheda and Lambata villages, suburbs of Kwali Area Council which also threatened FGGC Kwali. According to the Minister, the timely intervention of security Agencies saved the situation. “All necessary arrangements should be made for final year students to conclude their NECO examinations. “Principals of Unity Colleges across the country must liaise with security Agencies within their jurisdictions to forestall any security breach in our schools,” the Minister of Education added. Recall that following the jailbreak that occurred at the Kuje correctional centre in Abuja, the terrorist group believed to be the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) had warned of other attacks in schools and places of worship. The latest threats also followed an attack on a Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State where scores of worshippers were killed in cold blood. In recent times, a number of religious leaders have also fallen prey to terrorist groups, with some, unfortunately, losing their lives in the process. Residents of the FCT were on Monday, awoken to news trending on social media that the Federal Government has shut down all unity schools. But it was later confirmed that only FGC Kwali was affected for the time being. Parents were seen scampering to evacuate their wards from the school located in the suburb of FCT.
