Premier League side, Everton Football Club have been tipped to go down next season over their lack of activities in the transfer market. Transfer market expert, Alex Crook named teams expected to be at the bottom of the table next season, judging from their business activities this summer. Frank Lampard’s Everton were widely expected to be active in the market following the relegation battle they survived last season. But the reverse seems to be the case as the Toffees have allowed the likes of Richarlison and others to leave Goodison Park. “That relegation battle is fascinating because Brentford have spent money, Nottingham Forest have brought in half a dozen players for decent money, Fulham are busy, ” Crook said on talkSPORT. “Andreas Pereira will be their latest recruit. He played a friendly for them yesterday, so there could well be an established team. “I am looking at Everton, based on what happened to them last season, based on lack of activity. They could well find themselves in trouble again.”
