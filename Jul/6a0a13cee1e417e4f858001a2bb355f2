President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday sympathised with former PDP National Chairman, Adamu Muazu, over the killing of his brother and abduction of his sister by bandits. This was contained in a statement by Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity. President Buhari said: “I am shocked and outraged by the story of the killing of your brother and the abduction of your sister by bandits. This double tragedy is particularly moving. I know it’s hard to cope with the weight of this tragedy in your family. I feel your pain. “Let me use this opportunity to reassure you and other Nigerians currently facing threats from the atrocities of the bandits that I will leave no stone unturned to ensure these enemies of humanity are finally crushed and decisively defeated.” The President said, “Security is my constant concern and I have kept the service chiefs on their toes to ensure that they come up with a decisive solution to end this menace.” He prayed to God “to forgive the soul of the deceased and grant the family fortitude to overcome this double tragedy.”
