Former Arsenal star, Kevin Campbell has given his verdict on incoming Manchester United new player, Christian Eriksen. Manchester United are close to completing a deal for Eriksen, who is available on a Bosman move. Man United manager, Erik ten Hag, is eager to fix Eriksen into the Red Devils’ midfield with the departure of Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic, Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard this summer. Eriksen, whose contract with Brentford has just ended, has reportedly verbally agreed to move to Old Trafford and will be signing a three-year contract at the club. However, Campbell believes Man United’s move for the Denmark international is a brilliant one, adding that the former Tottenham Hotspur and Inter Milan star will help Bruno Fernandes at Old Trafford. “I think he [Eriksen] could play alongside Bruno Fernandes. Eriksen is such an intelligent footballer and such a good footballer, he can play in multiple positions,” Campbell told Football Insider. “He could play for any team in the league. Of course, he has a history with Ten Hag, which I am sure was a factor. Ten Hag helped him when he was making his recovery. He has trained at Ajax. There is obviously a connection there. “This move is brilliant for both Eriksen and United, in my opinion. Can he play with Fernandes? I think he can. Fernandes is a top player, but he needs help. When it was all on his shoulders last season, he didn’t hit the heights. It was not the same Fernandes. He needs more help. Eriksen can provide that.”
