Former super-middleweight champion, Carl Froch has said Anthony Joshua needs a “brain transplant” before his rematch with Oleksandr Usyk. Joshua is looking to become a three-time heavyweight world champion by beating the Ukrainian. Froch has questioned the Briton’s mentality ahead of the rematch in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on August 20. Usyk won the initial fight last September at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Since then, Joshua has hired a new trainer, Robert Garcia, who is believed to add more aggression to the 32-year-old’s boxing style. Despite the switch-up, Froch does not fancy Joshua’s chances of turning the tables this time around. “Sometimes a change is good, but for Anthony Joshua to beat Oleksandr Usyk, he needs a brain transplant. “He’s got all the physical attributes but I just don’t think he can beat him,” Froch told Betfred’s Lightweight Boxing Show.
