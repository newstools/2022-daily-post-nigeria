Nigerian Correctional Service, Ogun State Command, has debunked rumour that one of the suspected killers of Sofiat Okeowo had died in custody. Okeowo was killed and beheaded in Abeokuta earlier this year by some teenage boys, one of whom was her boyfriend. The boys were burning the victim’s head for money ritual when they were caught by a local security guard in Oke Aregba area of Abeokuta. The boys have since been arraigned and detained in custody pending the determination of their case. Lately, there were speculations that one of the suspected ritual killers had died in detention. But, the Controller of Corrections, Ogun State command, Mr Alimi Abdul-Rasheed, said the three suspects in its custody are hale and hearty, adding that report of death is untrue. “To set the records straight, the command wishes to state that three of the suspects presently in our custody are hale and hearty,” Abdul-Rasheed stated. He explained how the four suspects, Waris Oladeinde, Balogun Mustakeem, Abdulgafar Lukman and Majekodunmi Soliudeen, were remanded by the court on February 3. He recalled that Waris Oladeinde had been released by the court on March 14, saying others are still in custody on the order of the court. He urged that the fake report be disregarded, adding that the service would ensure safe and humane custody of offenders, as well as their rehabilitation and reintegration back to the society.
