Liverpool legend, Mark Lawrenson, has revealed that Manchester United captain Harry Maguire’s problem at Old Trafford is that he is a good player. Lawrenson also warned Maguire that his place in the Red Devils’ starting XI might not be secure, despite remaining club captain. Maguire made his first appearance under new manager Erik ten Hag during the Red Devils’ 4-1 win over Melbourne Victory in a pre-season friendly tie on Friday. The England international was present on the pitch when the A-League outfit scored within the first five minutes. The 29-year-old endured a miserable campaign last term, which was riddled with sloppy mistakes and poor performances. However, with the impending arrival of Ajax defender Lisandro Martinez, Lawrenson has warned Maguire that his place in the Manchester United team could be in doubt. “Club captain used to mean that you were captain of the club, not necessarily team captain. Harry Maguire is a good player, but like a lot of them last year, he had a really poor season,” Lawrenson told Paddy Power. “His problem is that he’s a good footballer, but he is just a bit slow – you can’t really make yourself any faster, unfortunately! I don’t know whether it’ll be him leading the team every week. In all honesty, I would watch this space.”
