There was tension at a fuel station in Lagos on Thursday as a woman suddenly stripped naked. After removing her clothes, she grabbed one of the nozzles and continually dispensed petrol. The yet-to-be-identified woman sprayed the product on attendants, vehicles, and people who were in a queue. The incident happened at the AP Adova station near the roundabout in the Falomo area of Ikoyi. As she continued the erratic behaviour, a number of men nearby scrambled to get her under control. They included a policeman and a Lagos State Transport Management Agency (LASTMA) officer. The woman, believed to be mentally unstable, was hurriedly carried away from the scene. Calm was eventually restored after the workers used water to wash off the wasted premium motor spirit (PMS).
