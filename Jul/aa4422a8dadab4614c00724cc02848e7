The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar has been described as unserious ahead of the Osun State governorship election. The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, had scheduled the Osun State governorship election to hold on July 16. While the election is a few days away, Atiku is believed to be residing in Dubai with no news of him returning to the country to campaign for the PDP candidate in Osun State. The former Vice President had left Nigeria for Dubai shortly after the PDP’s presidential primary election. Reacting, a rights activist, Deji Adeyanju, berated Atiku over his absence ahead of the governorship election. In a tweet, the Abuja-based lawyer, described the PDP as the most useless opposition party. He tweeted: “Atiku still abroad and Osun election is in 5 days. Very unserious presidential candidate. Useless party in power and Nigeria currently plagued with the most useless opposition political parties.” Meanwhile, the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu and some chieftains of the party are billed to storm the state. Tinubu and some APC chieftains will visit the state for the party’s campaign grand finale.
