The Osun State Government has described as untrue the claim by the Governor-elect, Senator Ademola Adeleke, that government officials are diverting and looting government assets. Adeleke had in a statement signed by his spokesperson, Mallam Olawale Rasheed, alleged that Oyetola’s allies and top government officials were diverting and looting government assets. He also claimed that the governor had allegedly embarked on a borrowing spree. The government in its response signed by the State Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Funke Egbemode, accused the PDP of peddling lies and propaganda just to curry undeserved public sympathy. She argued that Oyetola does not have a background of pilfering or misappropriating funds, “The records are there for verification.” Egbemode said the Governor-elect camp is “poisoning the public with lies and raising false alarms just to heat up the polity of the state, as is their practice.” The commissioner affirmed that the state government did not take any N17 Billion loan to prosecute the election. “Oyetola’s government remains a responsible one that has discharged its duties meritoriously, to the admiration of fellow governors, including those in the opposition. “It is time for Mr. Adeleke to tell the people how he intends to govern them rather than trying to blame everyone but himself for his fears. Given his admiration for his newly-learnt expression, “fact check”, we extend a call to Mr. Adeleke to show evidence of pilfering or looting to the people of Osun to prove that he is a man whose words have atoms of believability.” She, however, called on the people to ignore the fake lamentations of the “incurable propagandists” insisting that Oyetola has done well thus far and he will continue to do right by the people.
