Oluwatosin Ikuhemeyin, a notorious cultist who terrorized the Igbokoda community and escaped from jail in Owo in March 2022 was on Monday recaptured by operatives of the Ondo State Police Command. The convict was said to have broken out of jail just after arriving at the facility within two weeks. Speaking while parading the suspect, the State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Funmilayo Odunlami, claimed that detectives had been tracking the dreaded cultist known as ‘4G’ due to his shooting prowess. Odunlami claimed that the arrested cultist, alongside six other inmates who were on the command’s wanted list, escaped from Owo Correctional Centre. “The suspect, Tosin Ikuhemeyin, a.k.a. 4G, had been on the wanted list of the command over his role in multiple cult battles in the state that have resulted in the death of certain members of another cult organization.” “He was a member of the Aye cult group and was captured in Igbokoda, where he was hiding out. He will soon be charged in court. Speaking on his arrest, the 24-year-old cultist stated that “Before I was caught and taken to an Owo correctional facility, I was a member of the Aye cult and the group’s head in Igbokoda. After being imprisoned for two weeks, I was detained this morning in Igbokoda, but I managed to escape from Owo Prison with the help of six other inmates. “I met with some inmates in the prison who had been plotting an escape before I arrived, and they successfully incorporated me into their schemes under the leadership of one Dada.”
