Manchester United forward, Marcus Rashford has said he is in a “good place” and is ready for a fresh start under new manager Erik ten Hag. Rashford looked off the pace last season as United endured a miserable campaign under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and then Ralf Rangnick. He scored just five goals and lost his place in the England team. But the 24-year-old says he feels refreshed after a summer break. “For me it is a fresh start, something I am looking forward to. The first two and a half weeks of training has been good. We have improved a lot [and we’re] a lot fitter than last season. “We have a lot of room for improvement. I’m in a good place right now. I am looking forward to getting more games under my belt and getting ready for the season,” Rashford said at a news conference in Melbourne, Australia.
