The Zamfara state All Progressives Congress (APC) stakeholders have told the Presidential candidate of the party, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu to express his commitment to tackle insecurity in the state before they can pledge their support. The stakeholders made this known in a statement issued Thursday by the APC Zonal Publicity Secretary, North West, Malam Musa Mada. They assured they would only support and deliver the state in the 2023 elections if Tinubu promised to tackle insecurity in the state. According to the statement, “As the fact-finding tour of the North West Zonal officials of All Progressives Congress reached Zamfara on Wednesday, the stakeholders of the party in the State assured the Zonal Chairman, Malam Salihu Lukman and his team that they have unflinching loyalty to the party in whatever course and they are united in all fronts to give the party the required result necessary to claim the state in totality. “Yet, they demand the commitment of the presidential and all other candidates vying for electoral posts from the party for them to deliver the state to them. “The party’s stakeholders demand a serious commitment on the deteriorating security situation in the State and the region from anybody vying for any electoral post, especially the presidential candidate from the party to work for his success.”
