Barely two days to the Eid-el-Kabir celebration, Kaduna residents travelling for Sallah celebrations have lamented the heightened fuel scarcity that has impeded their travel plans. Fuel scarcity, which has resurfaced with greater intensity over the last few days in Kaduna and its environs, has left many travellers and other road users stranded on the roads, with vehicle owners spending several hours queuing at filling stations. Only a few commercial vehicles were sighted at various garages in Kaduna, with a flood of travellers. At various garages visited by a DAILYPOST correspondent in Kaduna, on Thursday, Television Garage motor park, Kawo motor park, Sabon-Tasha motor park and Central Market motor park, many travellers were seen begging drivers to reduce the transport fare, as those who could not afford them turned back to their houses. At Kawo motor park, Mrs. Maryam said she was travelling to Ibadan to celebrate Sallah with her family but the transportation fare has been increasing daily, though she vowed to travel at all cost. According to her, the fare used to be N7500 but they just increased it to N8,000. However, another traveller, Alhaji Ibrahim Yusuf turned back home upon hearing at the Television garage that the transport fare to Sokoto is N4000. He said he would rather send the money to his wife, than waste it travelling. At Sabon Tasha garage, Dr. Mustapha Rabo said he was traveling to Kachia to meet his family and they asked him to pay N1000 as against N700, but he has no option. A visit to the garages showed several travellers trooping in, but only very few made their journey, as most of them turned back home due to the high cost of transportation resulting from fuel scarcity.
