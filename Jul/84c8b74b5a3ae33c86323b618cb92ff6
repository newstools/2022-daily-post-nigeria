The Osun State governor-elect, Senator Ademola Adeleke, has debunked the insinuation that the Minister of Interior Rauf Aregbesola worked for his victory in the just concluded governorship election. It can be recalled that Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, on Sunday, emerged the winner of the governorship election in Osun State, defeating the incumbent governor, Gboyega Oyetola. There was an insinuation that Aregbesola, who had a face-off with the All Progressives Congress, APC presidential candidate Bola Tinubu, was behind Adeleke’s victory. However, speaking with Channels TV on Monday night, Adeleke said he never spoke with Aregbesola prior to the poll. He, however, admitted that some of the minister’s allies joined forces with him to defeat the incumbent governor, who was the candidate of the ruling APC. He said, “I did not work with Aregbesola, I did not even speak to him, but I know some APC members and his allies that joined us. I can’t tell whether Aregbesola asked his associates to support me or not because I never had a conversation with him”. Asked to assess the election process, Adeleke said, “it is not easy to defeat an incumbent anywhere in the world.”
