Aare Onakakanfo of Yoruba land, Iba Gani Adams has again deplored Nigeria’s insecurity, declaring that Yorubas are ready to defend themselves against terrorists. The traditional leader warned gunmen to stop testing the will of the region and the indigenes to prevent additional atrocities. Adams said the Southwest Security Stakeholders Group (SSSG), comprising the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) and others, will henceforth resist attacks. The Aare spoke on Tuesday during a visit to the Olowo of Owo kingdom, HRM Oba Ajibade Ogunoye. In a statement by his spokesman, Kehinde Aderemi, Adams assured that efforts were underway to forestall a repeat of the June 5 massacre. More than 40 worshippers died after gunmen opened fire at the St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State. The Federal Government announced that the Islamic State’s West Africa Province (ISWAP) was responsible. Adams said the incident remained the most devastating experience of terrorism in Yoruba modern history. The chief recalled issuing a statement to console the king and the people, reiterating his support to make the town safe. “I also wrote a letter informing the United Nations Secretary General, Mr. Antonio Guterres of the need to prevent further calamity capable of destroying Nigeria, like what happened in Bosnia,” he said. Adams added that the memo was addressed to the international community and the State Security Departments across the world. “This time around, the Yoruba are more united; we are not cowards. In Yoruba land, we have never lost any war. “Therefore, we are not going to relent or relax until we get rid of terrorists across the Southwest”, he vowed. Oba Ogunoye thanked Adams for the struggle to defend the region and blamed the high rate of insecurity on the federal system of government. The monarch stressed that the establishment of State police would ensure internal security of the country. “Owo people are prepared to defend themselves against external aggressors”, he asserted.
