Manchester City defender, Aymeric Laporte, has insisted that he has no intention of leaving the club amid interest from Chelsea. Chelsea are in the transfer market for two new central defenders this summer and Laporte is on their shortlist alongside his Man City teammate Nathan Ake. But Laporte, 28, says he is ‘supper happy’ at Man City, ruling out any possible move to Chelsea. “It’s very good for the club and for me,” Laporte told RMC Sport. “I’m happy to benefit people here too by bringing the Premier League trophy. It had never happened. “So I’m super happy with this season that I have had, despite an injury at the end of the season. I was able to hold on until the end. “Yes [I am staying this season], I’m super happy and fit. The team too. There remains only the common objective, the Champions League, but we will do everything to get it this year.” “I still have three years of contract. I’m happy and the club is too,” he added. Laporte won his fourth Premier League title with Man City last season. The Spain international has established a solid partnership alongside Ruben Dias at the heart of Pep Guardiola’s defence.
