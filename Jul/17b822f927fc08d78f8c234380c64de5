Barcelona President, Joan Laporta has said that his meeting with Jorge Mendes was not centred on Cristiano Ronaldo. According to him, he held talks with Mendes and discussed the transfer market in general with the super agent. Ronaldo had last weekend told Manchester United he desires to leave Old Trafford. The Portuguese is said to be angered by lack of transfer activities at the club. His desire to play in the Champions League next season is another factor prompting his search for a new club. However, it remains uncertain where the football icon will be next season, with clubs such as Chelsea said to be keen on signing him. Mendes is one of the most influential agents in world football and will be tasked with finding a new club for the Portuguese star. During a press conference at Camp Nou, according to Marca, Laporta revealed that he met with Mendes, but was coy about a potential move for Ronaldo “I had dinner with Jorge Mendes on Monday and we talked about the market in general,” he said. “Cristiano? I’m not going to talk about players we discussed at the meeting, but it’s always good to know how some names are on the market.”
