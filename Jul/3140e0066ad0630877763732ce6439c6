The Federal Government was anticipating how Secretary General of Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Mohammadu Barkindo, would use his expertise for the benefit of Nigeria’s local oil industry when he suddenly died. Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, stated this in the Adamawa State capital, Yola, on Sunday when he paid a condolence visit to the Lamido Adamawa, Alhaji Muhammad Aliyu Musfafa. Barkindo, who had died on the night of July 5, was flown to Yola, his home town and buried the following day, July 6. Boss Mustapha, who spoke to newsmen who covered his visit to the Lamido Adamawa Sunday evening, said the Federal Government was waiting for the little time left for the world (OPEC) to release Barkindo to Nigeria so that he could spend more time helping the country in addressing current challenges around the local oil industry. “Oil prices are up but we can’t see the benefits translated to the daily needs of our people because of the heavy loans under recovery (subsidy) being paid. “He (Barkindo) would have been helpful to Nigeria, especially in dealing with challenges of meeting the OPEC quota,” the SGF said. He said Barkindo’s death was a huge loss and a sad one, and recalled that Barkindo had come home (Nigeria) to make time to spend with his family during the Eid-el Kabir Sallah festivity, only for him to die before he could achieve that.
