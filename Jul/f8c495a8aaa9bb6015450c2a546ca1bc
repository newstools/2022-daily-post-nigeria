Former Liverpool star, Danny Murphy, has given a reason why Bruno Fernandes and Christian Eriksen cannot play together for Manchester United. Murphy said Man United manager, Erik ten Hag, cannot play both Eriksen and Fernandes, who is the club’s regular No 10, in the same midfield three because it would leave his team vulnerable defensively. Recall that Eriksen was Ten Hag’s second signing at Man United last week after he turned down the chance to stay at Brentford. “I think United are going to play one No 10. If you think you are going to get Eriksen and Fernandes in a midfield three and be able to compete with teams athletically and defensively, you have got no chance,” Eriksen told talkSPORT. “He will play his share of games because you don’t have the same XI for a season, we know that. “You will see the rotation and its five subs this season as well, so there is going to be an impact off the bench, but he is not going to play ahead of Fernandes. “Some people might prefer him to Fernandes, but his numbers don’t suggest he is on Fernandes’ level.”
