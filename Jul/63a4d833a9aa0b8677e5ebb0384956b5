Former Manchester United defender, Rio Ferdinand, has reserved praise for new manager Erik ten Hag, after the team thrashed arch-rivals Liverpool 4-0 in their pre-season meeting in Bangkok. The Red Devils went in at the break three goals up, thanks to Jadon Sancho, Fred and Anthony Martial. Facundo Pellistri added a fourth in the second half to get Ten Hag’s reign off to an excellent start. While it is still very early days, Ferdinand claims he saw positive patterns of play that they’ve been “crying out for years”. “Seen a few things we been crying out for the last few yrs [sic]… But we’ve seen it sparingly before. “All in all.. good day at the office! I’m feeling the Ten Hag look on the touch line,” Ferdinand tweeted.
