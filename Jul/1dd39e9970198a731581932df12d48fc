Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel has been told to name summer signing, Raheem Sterling as the Blues new captain. Given his reasons for this, former Manchester City star, Trevor Sinclair, noted that Sterling is the Vice-captain of the England national team According to him, the only player with more experience than Sterling in the Chelsea team is Thiago Silva, who is already 34-year old. He said it was not advisable for Tuchel to build his team around someone who might be leaving at the end of the season. Speaking on talkSPORT, Sinclair said: “I think Raheem Sterling should go in at Chelsea and become the captain. “If you look at it, he’s vice-captain of England and the only person who you can say has more experience than him is Thiago Silva and he’s getting on. “Everyone looks up to him. You hear young players all the time talking about how Raheem Sterling did this and how he helped them with that. “I think he could go in and be a great captain for Chelsea. He could lead that team to something very special.”
