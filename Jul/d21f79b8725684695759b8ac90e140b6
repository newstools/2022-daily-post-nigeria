The Niger State Chapter of the Nigeria Miners Association, NMA, has called on the Federal Government to reverse the ban placed on mining and motorcycles due to security challenges facing the country. The state chairman of the Association, Mohammed Mambo who made the call in Minna, said the ban will only cause more havoc and create unemployment among the teeming youths in the country. He stated,” thousands of people are benefiting from the mining sector of the economy and any attempt to ban mining and motorcycle will be counterproductive. The Chairman insisted that rather the federal government should support security agencies towards effective intelligence gathering in tackling the security challenges confronting the nation. Also, the representative of women in mining, Khadijat Alimashawun told our Correspondent that the ban by the federal government would further lead to more hardship for miners in the state. She urged the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration to reconsider the decision to reduce their plights as they have no other means of survival.
