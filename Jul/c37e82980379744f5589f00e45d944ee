An aggrieved governorship aspirant of the New Nigerian Peoples Party (NNPP), has approached the Federal High Court sitting in Jalingo, Taraba State, seeking for the disqualification of the party’s guber candidate. The aggrieved aspirant, Philip Johnson, wants the court to restrain Professor Mohammed Yahaya Sani from filing out as the party’s governorship candidate in the next election. In a copy of his writ of summon obtained by DAILY POST, he said the party should not forward the name of Professor Sani to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as the governorship candidate of NNPP in Taraba. Stressing that the candidate “is not a qualified member of the party”, he said he ought not to be allowed to “participate in the said governorship primaries of the NNPP in the State held on the 6th of June, 2022”. Further buttressing his arguments, he said the “participation of Professor Sani in the said NNPP governorship primary in Taraba on the 6th of June, 2022, after he had participated in the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship primaries, contravenes Section 77()1-(3) of the Electoral Act, 2022.” Describing the candidate’s nomination by the party as “null and void and of no effect”, he begged the court to go ahead and restrain him from parading himself as the party’s gubernatorial flagbearer for Taraba. Professor Sani, a former governorship aspirant of the APC, dumped the party for the NNPC, when his political ambition was thwarted in the APC. Like the guber candidate of the NNPP, both the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidates in the State, are facing one pre-election matter or the other.
