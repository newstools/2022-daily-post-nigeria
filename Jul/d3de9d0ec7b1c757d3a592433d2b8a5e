Manchester City have decided not to sell Nathan Ake to Chelsea this summer. This is according to transfer expert, Fabrizio Romano. Romano claims City would rather allow Oleksandr Zincheko to leave for Arsenal. Chelsea will now turn their attention to Paris Saint-Germain defender, Presnel Kimpembe, who has previously worked with manager Thomas Tuchel. “Manchester City internal decision: Oleksandr Zinchenko can leave the club, Arsenal are prepared to submit an official proposal. “Nathan Aké stays at the club after talks with Guardiola despite personal terms agreed with Chelsea. “Chelsea, still working on Kimpembé,” Romano tweeted. City and Chelsea have already done business this summer, with Raheem Sterling leaving the Premier League champions in a €55million deal.
