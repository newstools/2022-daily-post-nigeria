A former Commissioner for Justice and Attorney General in Oyo State, Barrister Abdulroheem Adebayo Lawal, has been sworn in as the new deputy governor in Oyo State. Lawal, a native of Kishi in Oke Ogun geo-political zone, took the oath of office administered by the Chief Judge in the state, Justice Munta Abimbola. The ceremony took place in Ibadan on Monday. Lawal, until his appointment, was the chairman of the Oyo State Housing Corporation. DAILY POST reports that Lawal replaced Engineer Rauf Olaniyan. Olaniyan, a native of Igboho also in Oke Ogun zone was removed from office by Oyo state House of Assembly dominated by members of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Monday. The lawmakers during their plenary also approved the name of Bayo Lawal as the replacement for Olaniyan. DAILY POST recalls that the removal of Olaniyan is coming few weeks after he dumped PDP and joined All Progressives Congress (APC). The state governor, who was present during the swearing in ceremony, charged the new deputy governor to see his position as a responsibility to deliver good governance to the people of the state. Makinde admonished Lawal to put the interest of the state first and serve the state diligently in his new capacity. “I want to start by welcoming our new Deputy Governor, His Excellency, Barrister Bayo Lawal, to the Oyo State Executive Council. I know you operated from this Exco chamber from 1999 to 2003 and I am sure a lot of things have changed between then and now. “As we all know, you are already a part of this administration as the chairman of the Oyo State Housing Corporation. “Your new position is evidence that you excelled in your role. But for us, as the saying goes, the reward for hard work is more work, and that is why we are giving you more work.”
