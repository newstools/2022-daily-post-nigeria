Former Manchester United defender, Gary Neville, has told the club to deal with Cristiano Ronaldo’s future “decisively”. Ronaldo is trying to engineer a move away from Old Trafford, after only making his return to the club last summer. It is understood the 37-year-old wants to play in the Champions League, with the Red Devils having only qualified for the Europa League. Neville, writing on Twitter, has said that if United does not deal with the issue quickly, it could become a distraction as Erik ten Hag takes over as manager. “The only important factor with the Ronaldo situation is that it’s dealt with decisively and quickly. “This can’t be a saga that takes the focus away from ETH bedding in period for the next two months,” he wrote.
