Socio-political activist, Reno Omokri has declared that the terrorists threatening to abduct President Muhammdu Buhari and the Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai are only bringing relief to Nigerians. DAILY POST recalls that a terrorist group in the North West who abducted the Abuja-Kaduna train passengers had threatened to kidnap Buhari and El-Rufai. The terrorists made the threat in a fresh video where they were captured flogging some of their captives, particularly the male victims. Reacting, Omokri in a post on his official Facebook page on Sunday, stated that Nigerians will not consider the terrorists’ plan as threat but relief. According to him, kidnapping the President would mean abducting all Nigerians’ problems. He wrote, “Why are these bandits threatening to abduct Buhari and El-Rufai? I am not sure Nigerians consider that a threat. “To many Nigerians, that would be a relief. Buhari that met Dollar at ₦190 and today it is ₦650? Abducting him is like abducting Nigeria’s problem! “Bandits threatening to abduct Buhari and El-Rufai is just like Pablo Escobar’s drug cartel threatening to abduct Bola Tinubu. What concerns the rest of us? What heroin and terrorism has joined together, who are Nigerians to put it asunder? I beg, leave us jare!”
