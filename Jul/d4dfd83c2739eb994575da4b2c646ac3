He said: “I don’t think we have a chance to sign Lewa but if there is, he is one of the best number nines. “I think, right now, there is not the first priority to get another big striker in.” Lewandowski has one year left on his current contract at Bayern. However, the 34-year-old is desperate to move to Barcelona this summer. The Poland international is already back with the Bundesliga champions and underwent pre-season medical tests.
