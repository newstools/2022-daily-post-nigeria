Prophet Bisi Olujobi of Wisdom Church of Christ International in Ketu, Lagos State, has predicted that the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, would win the 2023 presidential election. Olujobi said Tinubu would win, but his enemies would use his health issues against him. In a statement he signed, the clergyman said the APC presidential candidate would win the election but may never rule Nigeria. According to Olujobi: “In Asiwaju Tinubu’s case, he will clinch the 2023 presidential seat, but the enemies within will use his weakness and health issues against him. “You remember early in the year 2022 when I warned him about strange conspiracies and mockery which all happened. “His case again will turn out like that of Awolowo, Abiola and Yaradua, who was elected but never rule, except he prays very well. “God said all agitation for break up should seize for now as God wants to move through the country within the shortest period of time as human effort has failed.”
