Manchester United have been told to end their pursuit of Barcelona midfielder, Frankie de Jong. Transfer expert, Alex Crook says that the Red Devils have already lined up two midfield alternatives from the Premier League. De Jong is new manager Erik ten Hag’s top target this summer, but it is understood the midfielder is not keen on the move. Crook told talkSPORT that Leicester’s Youri Tielemans and Wolves star Ruben Neves have been lined up as alternatives. “I think they should walk away,” he said. “The first contact between Manchester United and Barcelona, as I understand it, as the middle of May. We are now almost in the middle of July. “This is ridiculous. It’s been a saga for too long. “I know Manchester United have a backup list. Youri Tielemans and Ruben Neves. “I would just call Barcelona’s bluff now and say ‘you either sell him or we are going to pay the same money for Ruben Neves’. “A player that’s proven in the Premier League.”
