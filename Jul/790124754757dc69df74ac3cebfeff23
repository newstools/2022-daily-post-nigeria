Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has said the decision of the All Progressives Congress governorship candidate in Kaduna State to select a Muslim as his running mate for the 2023 election is provocative, divisive, and absolutely non-tolerant of religious pluralism of the state. HURIWA said the decision is a brazen attempt to perpetuate the heightened state of insecurity in the state. The rights group also called on the people of Kaduna desirous of peace, tranquillity, interreligious harmony and sustainable development, to turn their backs against the APC in next year’s polls. Recalled that Uba Sani who is the governorship candidate of the APC in the state, anointed by Governor Nasir El-Rufai as his successor, claimed that after consultations with critical stakeholders, he had settled for Hadiza Sabuwa Balarabe as his running mate. HURIWA, however, condemned Sani’s Muslim-Muslim ticket as absolutely divisive and stated that from the available body of information the APC governorship candidate did not consult the large populations of Christians in Southern and Northern Kaduna. The Rights group said the APC’S gubernatorial candidate is simply attempting to continue to foist Islamic extremism in the governance of Kaduna State. HURIWA also said it blames the Muslim-Muslim administration of El-Rufai for the massive killings of mainly Christian natives of Southern Kaduna by armed Fulani terrorists who have the support of the Kaduna State government clearly.
