Manchester United’s players are reportedly not surprised by Cristiano Ronaldo’s latest decision to leave Old Trafford this summer. According to The Mail, Man United’s players are aware of how ambitious and driven Ronaldo is and “guessed that he would not want his legacy to end in the Europa League.” The report added that many of Man United’s stars “assumed he would only stay for a year once he realized just how far standards had slipped at the Red Devils in the 12 years he had been away.” Ronaldo had last weekend informed Man United of his desire to leave the club this summer amid concerns the club would not compete in the Champions League next season after finishing outside of the Premier League top four last campaign. The Portugal captain scored 18 goals in the Premier League games last season as Man United finished in the sixth position. It was reported earlier this week that the 37-year-old will not travel with the Manchester United squad for their pre-season tour of Thailand and Australia, as the club have given him extra time off to attend to a “family issue.” Man United are also reported to be willing to listen to offers for the five-time Ballon d’Or winner, with Premier League rivals Chelsea linked with a sensational swoop for the former Juventus and Real Madrid star.
