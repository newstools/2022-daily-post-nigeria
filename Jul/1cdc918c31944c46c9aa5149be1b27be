Tottenham Hotspur manager, Antonio Conte, has hit out at Bayern Munich and labelled them as “disrespectful” for talking about the possibility of signing Harry Kane in the future. Kane tried to force a move to Manchester City last season, but eventually stayed in North London. The England captain netted 17 times in 37 Premier League games last season, as Spurs sealed Champions League qualification. Bayern are looking to replace Robert Lewandowski, who signed for Barcelona last week. Speaking after Spurs’ 2-1 preseason win over Rangers on Saturday where Kane scored two goals, Conte said: “I don’t know why [Kane is linked with Bayern.] “The situation is very clear at Tottenham and Harry is a very important part of the project. I don’t like to talk about players from another club. Maybe that’s a bit disrespectful for the other club.”
