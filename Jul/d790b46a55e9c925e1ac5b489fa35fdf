The National Teachers Institute (NTI) says it has eliminated delays in processing results of candidates who sit for its examinations. The institute said on Friday in Yola that it would in the next three weeks release results of 3,241 Post Graduate Diploma in Education (PGDE) students and 3,086 Pivotal Teacher Training Programme (PTTP) students who completed their programmes across the country recently. The Chief Executive of the institute, Professor Musa Garba Maitafsir, spoke during the opening of a 3-day capacity building workshop for 70 Centre Managers from Borno, Yobe and Adamawa States, stressing that the institute had been able to eliminate delay in the processing of results. He attributed this to recently developed Students Results Management System (SRMS) for the purpose of electronic speed processing. On the capacity building workshop in Yola, the NTI chief executive said the center managers, who received training at the workshop would also be training 200 facilitators who will in turn train 18,367 unqualified teachers. “The NTI has embraced ICT in some programmes, operations and activities as use of course books (modules) as substitute to face-to-face interactions is no longer what distance learning is all about,” Professor Musa said, adding that although the NTI had lagged behind in the fast-moving technological world, it is trying to catch up. “Considering the age of establishment, the institute should by now be competing with top distance learning institutions of the world,” he said. He noted, however, that the NTI is now a West African Centre of Distance Education as approved by the African Council on Distance Education with headquarters in Kenya. “The target of the institution is to create and expand access to teachers’ education by distance learning throughout West Africa,” he said.
