A few days after he left the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adekunle Akinlade joined the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State. Akinlade, the anointed of the former Governor in Ogun, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, had earlier announced his defection from the ruling party, blaming his decision on injustice within the APC. Around 12pm on Friday, Akinlade arrived at the PDP state secretariat along Okemosan, Abeokuta to meet with party leaders.  He was received by the PDP State Chairman, Sikirulahi Ogundele and other leaders of the party. The governorship candidate of the Allied People’s Movement (APM) in 2019 visited the PDP secretariat alongside other members of the Amosun political structure in Ogun. Although Amosun has declared that he would stand with President Muhammadu Buhari and the APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, in spite of the injustice meted out to his camp, most of his followers said they would go with Akinlade.
