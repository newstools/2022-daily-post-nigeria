The National Population Commission (NPC) has foiled an attempt to hack its recruitment portal for the 2023 census. NPC Commissioner for Anambra, Chidi Ezeoke, made the disclosure at a news conference in Awka. Ezeoke said that the NPC had established a digitalised online geo-fenced portal to recruit personnel from selected communities across Nigeria. The official assured that the commission was committed to correcting anomalies to ensure an accurate and reliable census next year. “If hackers were not able to succeed in this, we want to ensure and assure that it will be difficult for them to hack during the 2023 census. “I’m almost certain that the attempt, to a large extent, was foiled. “When you are trying out something new, people will try to bypass your efforts”, NAN quoted him saying. Joachim Ulasi, NPC State Director refuted alleged substitution of recruited officers, saying the ones dropped were those absent during the 12-day training.
