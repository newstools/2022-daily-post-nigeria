Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel has commented on speculation linking the club with Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo and Bayern Munich’s Robert Lewandowski. According to Tuchel, signing another forward is “not the priority” following the arrival of Raheem Sterling from Manchester City. Instead, his focus is on Chelsea’s backline, with Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen leaving as free agents. “I would not rule it out [signing another striker] but right now it is not the priority. The priority right now is defence, it’s not a secret. From there, we need to see what’s possible. “We’re competing against the two top teams, but Tottenham did a very active and aggressive and early transfer period, they have maybe the strongest squad they ever had with one of the best coaches in the world. “Man Utd are never shy of recruiting with a new coach and Arsenal had some big signings already, so we need to keep the level up to be competitive,” Tuchel said.
