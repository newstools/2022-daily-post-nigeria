Omoyele Sowore, the Presidential Candidate of the African Action Party, AAC, has claimed some former Nigerian leaders are working for Peter Obi, the Labour Party, LP, presidential candidate. Sowore claimed that former Heads of State, Olusegun Obasanjo, Ibrahim Babangida and Abdulsalam Abubakar are all ‘working for’ Obi. He urged Nigerians not to vote for Obi because criminals were backing him. In a Facebook post, Sowore said the former Nigerian leaders are Obi’s “godfathers.” According to Sowore, these godfathers ruined Nigeria, hence Obi should be rejected. “Olusegun Obasanjo, Ibrahim Babangida, Aliyu Gusau, Abubakar Abdusalam and Ango Abdulahi are Peter Obi’s ‘Godfathers’. The people that ruined Nigeria are the ones fronting for him. “May it never happen that we will work with these criminals!” He wrote.
