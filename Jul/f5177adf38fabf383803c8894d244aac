The Ogun State Independent Electoral Commission (OGSIEC) will on Thursday hold a bye-election at Ward 5, Joga/Ibooro, Yewa North Local Government Area of Ogun State. DAILY POST reports that the bye-election becomes mandatory following the demise of the former Councilor, Hon. Sunday Isiaka. As part of its responsibilities, OGSIEC had taken voter education to Joga, Ibooro and Ijako in Yewa North, to sensitise the people on the bye election. Speaking during a courtesy visit to monarchs in the communities, OGSIEC Chairman, Mr Babatunde Osibodu, said the sensitization became necessary to prepare the people on the rudiments and procedures for casting their votes on the ballot papers, as well as to ensure a peaceful and fair bye election on July 14, 2022. Osibodu noted that, despite efforts and measures put in place to get other political parties on board for the election, only the All Progressives Congress (APC) showed interest in the election by picking up a nomination form, saying only the APC would be seen on the ballot. “This is a different kind of election because only one party came out to express interest, so the ballot paper is meant for affirmation, Yes or No. It is important to explain this to the people before the election day,” the Chairman stated. He explained further that, “since only one party emerged, 50 percent of votes must be cast before the candidate can be declared winner of the bye-election.” This, he said, is in accordance with the Ogun State electoral rules and regulations. In their separate remarks, the Abepa of Joga Orile, Oba Adeyemi Adekeye; the Aboro of Ibooro land, Oba Daniel Salako and the Awujako of Ijako land, Oba Matthew Ewedairo, commended the commission for its efforts, promising to mobilise their people for a successful bye-election.
