Nigerian music star, Kizz Daniel has given reasons why he arrived late at his New York show. The ‘Buga’ crooner came under attack on Friday after he kept his fans waiting in New York for hours without showing up. In some viral videos, some angry fans were seen throwing things on stage while waiting for the singer for about three hours. Taking to his Instagram page, Kizz Daniel said his passport was seized at the US Consulate in Nigeria till the day of the show for some reason. He explained that he could have rescheduled the show but could not do that because of his respect and love for fans and tried to make it to the venue but arrived late. His post read: “DMV, thank you for showing up last night and sincere apologies for all that happened. For some reason, my passport was withheld at the US Consulate in Nigeria until the day of the show and previously booked flights had to be cancelled. Same reason I rescheduled the New York show. “Just for the love and respect I have for you and my craft I got on the next available flight to New York the second I had my passport thinking I could still make it because I just don’t want to cancel another date. I booked a PJ to DMV from New York to make the journey faster but unfortunately, it did not work. “I went straight to the venue from the airport. We could have moved the show but my team and I believed we could meet up.” Kizz Daniel explained that his ‘Buga’ performance would have been longer if the management of the venue allowed that. He assured fans that a new date will be announced for another show with the same tickets valid. “The performance would have been longer also if the venue had allowed it. “So sorry guys, I will make it up to you. A new date will be announced and all your tickets remain valid.
New York, let’s have fun tonight!
