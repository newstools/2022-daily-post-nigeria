Former Nigeria coach, Gernot Rohr has said Napoli striker Victor Osimhen must work on “a few things” to become a world-class striker. In an interview with Sports Bild, Rohr advised Osimhen to work on his body language. “If he develops further, he can become one,” Rohr responded when asked if Osimhen can become a world-class striker, adding: “Victor still needs to improve a few things, like working on his body language. “If something doesn’t work, he shows it too much on the pitch. But these are small things, he can handle them.” Osimhen impressed last season for Napoli, helping them to a third-place finish in Serie A after scoring 14 top-flight goals from 27 appearances.
