Nasir Isa Kwarra, Executive Chairman of the National Population Commission (NPC), has revealed that the commission would engage the services of about 1.5 million ad-hoc staff during the forthcoming Housing and Population Census slated for April 2023. Kwarra stated this on Saturday on a live radio programme monitored by our correspondent, saying the outcome of the census will be made available digitally for stakeholders and data generating institutions for national planning and research purposes. He explained that the process and conduct of the census would be digital, to ensure accuracy of the census exercise. According to him, “The methodology for the next census has been designed to produce not only accurate, reliable and acceptable census data but also inclusive and user-friendly census data.” In his submission, Dr. Inuwa Jalingo, Census Manager in the Commission, said the recruitment portal for the exercise was created three months ago, adding that the recruitment is done digitally to guarantee transparency and integrity of the process. He, therefore, urged qualified Nigerians to visit the portal and apply on the Commission’s website. Jalingo solicited the support and cooperation of Nigerians to ensure a successful census exercise. Also speaking, Mrs. Evelyn Olanipekun, Director of Census, said the Commission had already carried out Enumeration Area Demarcation (EAD) in the 772 Local Government Areas(LGAs) out of the 774 LGAs in Nigeria as well as done first and second Census Pretest in the selected Enumeration Areas in the 36 States of the Federation and Federal Capital Territory, Abuja in preparation for the 2023 Census. She further explained that the Census Pretest was done based on variation, terrain, culture and topography of the selected places.
