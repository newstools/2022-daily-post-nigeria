Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has said Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has agreed to pick a Muslim as his running mate. Ganduje disclosed this on Friday during a gathering of about 100 clerics at the Kano state government house as part of activities to mark Eid-El Kabir. He said, “We have advised him [Tinubu] to pick a Muslim deputy, and he has agreed. “A Muslim-Muslim ticket is a reality. It’s not something new in Nigeria.” Ganduje also asked the clerics to pray for Tinubu to emerge as Nigeria’s next president in 2023. Tinubu had, in June this year, emerged as the APC’s presidential flag bearer. The former Lagos State governor scored 1,271 votes to defeat his closest contenders, Rotimi Amaechi, who pulled 316 votes and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who scored 235 votes.
