The comments on the 2023 Nigeria elections made by the Oba of Benin, Omo N’Oba Ewuare II are trending. The monarch, who received Vice President Yemi Osinbajo at his palace, said many aspirants were only seeking positions to amass wealth. The traditional ruler, on Thursday, noted that the VP’s records were intimidating, NAN reports. “I think you are going to give a lot of problems to other contestants. There is no gainsaying that they all probably are shivering where they are.” Oba Ewuare listed Osinbajo’s qualities as “calmness, humility, great respect for culture and being a true man of God”. He expressed hope that Nigeria would be better if leaders have the fear of God, “not just to go there to rape the treasury and oppress people”. The Oba said most times, “people rushing to be president, vice president or governors, only to go there and loot the treasury, enrich themselves”. “We want to stay here in Nigeria, enjoy the good things of life in Nigeria; not in Dubai, not in the United States and others”.
