Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State has reached out to Christians as they mark the Easter celebration, urging individual sacrifices for the overall good. Fintiri who stated Friday that Easter “symbolises God’s redemptive mission over humanity and the triumph of light over darkness,” called on residents of Adamawa State to use the opportunity that Easter provides to show love to one another. “As we celebrate the Easter in sober recollection of Christ’s crucifixion, let us think about how we can each help to steer our state and nation back on the road to peace, by working in the spirit of oneness,” Fintiri said. Fintiri’s Easter message was contained in a statement sent to newsmen on Friday by his Press Secretary, Humwashi Wonosikou. “While commending the understanding they had exhibited to one another irrespective of their differences, the Governor pointed out that this had ensured mutual love and peaceful co-existence in the state,” the statement said. Expressing regrets that many would not be able to celebrate Easter with joy as the nation is currently gripped with gloom over killings, kidnappings and violence, the governor called for unity and resilience among Nigerians. He said, “The harsh conditions of living today are a tough test for the Country, but like the previous tests, we will pull through. We have been tested many times before and we have always done what is necessary to pull through all difficulty and adversity, we have always found inspiration in ourselves and each other to find the sunshine after the storm.”
