Popular Nigerian comedian, Debo Adedayo, known as Mr Macaroni, has raised alarm over threats on his life for protesting against the Lekki tollgate reopening. Mr Macaroni raised the alarm in a Twitter post. The Lekki tollgate was closed in October 2020 following the army’s crackdown on unarmed #EndSARS protesters. However, the Lekki Concession Company (LCC) after 17 months announced that tolling activities will resume at the gate on April 1. Mr Macaroni, who has been actively involved in the #EndSARS protest, had earlier kicked against the reopening, adding that it was an injustice to victims. Reacting to a tweet that threatened him, Macaroni wrote: “This is one of many threats I receive regularly. Nigerian police and Lagos State government. I love you, and I know you love me too.”
