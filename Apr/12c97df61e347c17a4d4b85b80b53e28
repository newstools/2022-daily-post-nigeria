The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Saturday assured Hausas residing in the South-East of their safety. Emma Powerful, the Media and Publicity Secretary of IPOB, assured that members of the group would never harm Hausas and non-indigenes residing across the South-East. Powerful said IPOB and its militia arm, the Eastern Security Network, ESN, would protect Hausas against the Jihadists attacking the people of the Southeast. He recalled how IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu preached against attacking Hausas and non-indigenes in the Southeast. A statement by Powerful said they “strongly condemn any attack on non-Biafran nationals living in our land. “Our leader Mazi Nnamdi KANU had predicted what is happening during his numerous prophetic radio broadcasts. During those broadcasts, he had also spoken against attacks on non-indigenes. “Kanu made a holistic announcement during those days that Hausas are facing the same predicaments Igbo people are facing in Nigeria and should be allowed to do business anywhere they like in Biafraland. Biafrans shall never try to harm any Hausa man or woman in Biafra land for any reason. “IPOB will ensure the protection of all persons living in Biafra land including non-indigenes. We will continue to protect them against our common enemy – the jihadists and their sponsors.”
