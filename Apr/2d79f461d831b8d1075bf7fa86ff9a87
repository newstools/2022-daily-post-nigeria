Former federal lawmaker, Shehu Sani has questioned former Nigeria internationals for staying away from sports administration in the country. The former lawmaker wondered what the likes of Jay Jay Okocha, Kanu Nwankwo, Oliseh, Finding Judges were afraid of, following the emergence of Samuel Eto’o as the President of the Cameroon Football Federation. Also, while former players such as George Weah is the President of a country, Liberia, Ivorian legend Didier Drogba is in line to become the Ivory Coast’s football federation president, just like Eto’o in Cameroon. Eto’o and Drogba played football almost at the same period with Okocha and the rest of the most successful Super Eagles’ legends. “Samuel Eto heads the Cameroon Football Federation and Drogba is gunning for the presidency of the Ivorian Football Federation,” Sani, who represented Kaduna Central District in the 8th National Assembly wrote in a post on Twitter. “Why are Nigeria’s former international players not running for the presidency of the @thenff ? Why are they afraid, shy or indifferent?” He queried. Football in Nigeria is majorly managed by men and women who never kicked the round leather game, whether locally or internationally.
