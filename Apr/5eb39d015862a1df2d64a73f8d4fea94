British racing driver, Sir Lewis Hamilton and super tennis star Serena Williams, have joined Sir Martin Broughton’s bid to buy Chelsea. The two world champions are supporting the bid with ‘millions’ of pounds, according to Sky News. The seven-time Formula 1 champion and 23-time Grand Slam-winning tennis player are reportedly backing the former Liverpool chairman’s takeover package. Broughton is currently in the frontline in list of the three bids to buy Chelsea from Roman Abramovich. Abramovich is compelled to sell the club following his sanction by the British government. Lord Coe is also involved in Broughton’s bid.
