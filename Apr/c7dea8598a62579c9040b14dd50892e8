Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, hosted 2023 presidential hopeful, Rotimi Amaechi, on Thursday in Marina. The Minister of Transportation is on a tour of states over his bid on the All Progressives Congress (APC) platform. In his remarks, Sanwo-Olu told the former Rivers Governor that Lagos will support the party’s leader, Bola Tinubu for the ticket. The governor said though Amaechi is qualified to lead Nigeria, the state’s endorsement is for Tinubu. “I have sheer regard and respect for our leader Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; I have been a direct beneficiary of his leadership. “I have been part of his cabinet and continue to toe that line of leadership Asiwaju stands for. But because we are not God, God himself will help the course of this country. “You are eminently qualified, you are very experienced in this journey. But for a whole lot of us in Lagos, Asiwaju continues to be our rallying point. “I certainly know what your pedigree is and what you have done. I will be unfair if I don’t say that. I wish you all the very best”, Sanwo-Olu said. Earlier, Amaechi said considering experience, he would be a president that would protect the interest of all Nigerians irrespective of tribe or religion.
