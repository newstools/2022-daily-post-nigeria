Banky W who made this known in a tweet on his official Twitter page also said he will be contesting for the seat of Eti-Osa federal constituency in the House of Representatives – in the 2023 general elections. Banky W who ran for the same position in 2019 under the Modern Democratic Party but lost recounted how he has been actively engaged in community service and attempted to be part of the solution to the problems of his constituents. The father of one said Nigerians can no longer settle for candidates who feel entitled to their place in government. The Nigerian people, he explained, need candidates who will earn and treasure their right to serve. And as a nation, we need innovation and reform. He said the latter will happen ”when enough of us with like minds, who have the best interest of the nation at heart are in government. “I will once again be answering the call to serve to represent Eti-Osa Federal Constituency of Lagos State in the House of Representatives on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). “Some may not agree or understand my decision to run or my choice of platform but I have learnt that we must engage with Nigeria where it is not where we hope that it should be. We must no longer be content to shout from the sidelines, we must get into the system and fix it. “The problems in Nigeria are from the top down but the solutions are from the bottom up hence the need for some of us to infiltrate the major platforms that exist to build an army of like minds who will enter government with the same agenda,” he added.
