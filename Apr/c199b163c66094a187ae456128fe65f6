The Zamfara State Command of Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC), has warned that all hoodlums and miscreants should stay off all mosques and places of worship where the last ten days in the month of Ramadan 2022 will be observed. The commandant of the Corps, Mr. A. A. Sparks issued this statement when he addressed personnel of the Corps deployed to keep watch over the TAHAJJUD and ITIKAFI prayers in Gusau, the State capital. Sparks said the holy month of Ramadan is held in high esteem as Muslim faithfuls use the period for sober reflections and to make amends with God Almighty, stressing that “on no account will anyone be allowed to truncate the flow of prayers in this period with nefarious activities.” He said for these last 10 days of Ramadan, the Rapid Response Squad and the Special Intelligent Squad of the Corps have been charged to monitor and place an intensive surveillance in all the Mosques where these prayers will be conducted to avoid any breach of security. The State NSCDC boss said that all the Mosques have become the proteges of the Corps and as such no hoodlum or miscreant will be spared in an advent of any breach of peace or show of criminality. He saluted all Muslim Faithfuls for the holy month of Ramadan and encouraged them to go about their lawful businesses.
