The Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo has been asked to resign from his position. Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, said Osinbajo should resign over the alleged failure of President Muhammadu Buhari. Omokri recalled how former Deputy Head of State, Ebitu Ukiwe, resigned when former Head of State, Ibrahim Babangida, opted to register Nigeria as a member of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. He lamented that Osinbajo can’t stand up to Buhari amidst the killings of Christians and burning of churches in the North. In a series of tweets on Saturday, Omokri wrote: “You ask what I expect Osinbajo to do over Buhari’s failure? Ebitu Ukiwe was vice to Gen Babangida. When IBB applied for Nigeria to join the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, Ukiwe opposed it. When IBB insisted, Ukiwe resigned. Ukiwe fears God more than Osinbajo! “People saying VP Osinbajo is powerless are ignorant. Obasanjo was military vice to Murtala. When Murtala did something Obasanjo found unconscionable, Obasanjo physically confronted Murtala. TY Danjuma separated them. Obasanjo and Danjuma are still alive. Google it! “Those saying Osinbajo cant say anything when Christians are killed and churches are destroyed in the North under Buhari, because it’s religious, have forgotten that both Buhari and APC unashamedly used Osinbajo’s alleged pastoral position to campaign in 2015 & 2019!”
