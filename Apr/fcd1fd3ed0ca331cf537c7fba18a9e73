Former Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Prof Attahiru Jega has cautioned Nigerians against establishing bad government via the 2023 general elections. Jega, who spoke during the pre-Ramadan lecture at the University of Lagos Muslim Alumni, UMA, said there is need for Nigerians to develop a consensus that political leadership is not for the rich who must have embezzled public funds. According to him, if the current method of leadership recruitment in the country continues, the numerous problems bedeviling the nation would also remain. He urged Nigerians to find ways of character, capacity, and competence as determining factors for persons to occupy elective positions in the country. Jega, who conducted the 2015 general elections, expressed optimism that if Nigerians can stop supporting politicians based on their wealth, the country may be good again. He said, “We must develop an overwhelming consensus that political leadership cannot remain the only job for which no qualification appears necessary except to have a lot of money which is usually, stolen money. “It is for this reason that we must find a way to bring relevant criteria to bear on the selection of leadership in our dear country. We have got to find a way of making character, competence and capacity to determine who leads us.”
