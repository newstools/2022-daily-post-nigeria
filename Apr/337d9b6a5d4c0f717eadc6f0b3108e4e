The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has lamented the low participation of Anambra indigenes in the intervention programmes of the bank. The CBN controller in Anambra, Mr Benedict Maduagwu disclosed this during a sensitization fair of the apex bank in Awka, lamenting that despite the abundance of skills and talent in the state, only 44,374 persons from the state have benefitted. He, however, said the organisation has intensified efforts to bring together and speak to people in the state to get them up to date about requirements for some of the organisation’s programmes so that they can get funds to expand their businesses. “Anambra people have been participating in various CBN intervention programmes, but the truth is that the number has not been encouraging. “Since inception, only 44,374 beneficiaries have been registered in Anambra State, in CBN intervention programmes, yet Anambra is a state with an abundance of talent, skills and inventors. Representative of the Anambra State government, Pauly Onyeka who is the Commissioner for Housing applauded the organisation for the fair, stating that Anambra should not for any reason be lagging because it is a state where talents and skills abound. “In fact, if the CBN has a N10 trillion budget for a programme, Anambra should get N1 trillion, because we have people who can utilize such funds well. We are hopeful that with this workshop, our people will learn to apply for programmes like this.” He encouraged youth corps members who were participants in the programme to pay attention and see reasons to apply for funds that can finance their ideas and turn them into employers, instead of job seekers upon conclusion of their mandatory one year service.
