The Anambra State Police Command has confirmed the killing of cows and goats in a cattle market in Igboukwu, Aguata Local Government Area. The incident happened on Thursday after the local government secretariat in Ekwulobia was set ablaze by unidentified gunmen. Command spokesperson, DSP Toochukwu Ikenga, who spoke to our correspondent described it as cruelty to animals. “What happened was that some elements while riding in motorbikes yesterday evening and shooting sporadically into the air got to the cattle market and while shooting, some cattle were shot too. “We have extended our surveillance to that area and our men are already working. This is cruelty to animal and very condemnable. The cattle in question are also owned by people of the area,” Ikenga said.
