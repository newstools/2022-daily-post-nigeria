Deji Adeyanju, an Abuja-based socio-political activist, has reacted to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo’s declaration to succeed his principal, Muhammadu Buhari, during next year’s general elections. DAILY POST had reported that Osinbajo said if given the opportunity he will provide an excellent environment for businesses to fly, enhance Nigeria’s Social Investment Programme to a full scale social welfare scheme. He also said he will create a tech economy that will provide jobs for millions of Nigerians. Reacting, Adeyanju warned Nigerians that Osinbajo was ‘extremely incompetent.’ He tweeted, “Osinbajo and the Yoruba people supporting him may think Nigeria was created for them but how can a man serve as Vice President for eight years in a divided and multi ethnic nation where some regions have never held power before and now want to be president for another eight years? “And this man is even extremely incompetent.”
