Former National and State Assembly members during the ex-Jigawa State Governor, Sule Lamido have dumped the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP for the New Nigeria People’s Party NNPP. Chairman caretaker committee Musa Bako Aujara stated this on Monday while briefing newsmen after stakeholders’ meeting and formal handing over held at the party’s headquarters in Dutse the state capital. He said the former PDP Commissioners, Assembly members alongside their supporters dumped the party for the NNPP due to political inconsistency, nepotism and lack of clear direction in the party. Aujara explained that the PDP and APC lack focus and have failed woefully to provide positive change in the lives of common Nigerians. He said Nigerians are tired of the lies by the PDP and APC and that the only option is to support the New Nigeria People’s Party NNPP for a better Nigeria. Aujara added that the NNPP has established a formidable structure in Jigawa State with the capacity to clinch power from APC in the state by 2023. “Today NNPP stands as the best option for Nigeria, this makes the party attractive, also going by the large number of people trooping into the party every day, this gives us hope that NNPP is on a clear path to take over Nigeria and the 36 states in the forthcoming 2023 general election ” Sabo declared
