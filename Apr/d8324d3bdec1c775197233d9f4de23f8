Growing concerns with power supply in the country may have prompted the Federal Executive Council to approve N1.4billion to boost the operations of the Transmission Company of Nigeria, TCN. A good part of the N1.4 billion is meant for the supply of more equipment for the TCN, explained the Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu, at the end of Wednesday’s FEC presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari. DAILY POST recalls that power outages had become a frequent trend in the past few weeks, following the alleged collapse of the national grid. The situation had also been compounded with an increase in diesel, an alternative source of energy by most households and production firms, a development that has also resulted in a hike in goods and services. Throwing more light on the approval, Aliyu said, “I presented two memos form the ministry of power for the Transmission Company of Nigeria. The first one was variation of the sum of a contract for 132/33 KV substation at Kafanchan, Kaduna State with a KV line base extension at Jos substation, in Plateau State. This is in the sum of N132,705, 861.42”. The Minister also noted that the second approval he got was for the supply of handling equipment and operational vehicles also for the Transmission Company of Nigeria at the cost of N1.3 billion. “The second memo was for the supply of handling equipment, haulage and operational vehicles for the TCN at N1,338,159,080. 88. They are heavy lifting equipment that the TCN requires for doing its work in the store and on the field, while changing equipment and moving transformers and the council graciously approved,” he said.
