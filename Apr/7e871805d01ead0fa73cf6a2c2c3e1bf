Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has said his team and Liverpool are both condemned to win their remaining seven fixtures or “it will all be over”. The Spaniard was speaking after a 2-2 draw with the Reds on Sunday. City failed to take all three points at the Etihad after Liverpool equalized twice through Diogo Jota and Sadio Mane. Guardiola hailed the game as “a good advert” for the league and was happy both teams tried to win. He told Sky Sports: “I think it is a good advert for the Premier League. It was a fantastic game and both teams tried to win. Liverpool is a joy to watch, I know the threats they have and how good they are. I think we performed really well and I’m so proud of my team. “Now both teams know [there are] seven games left, you have to win or it will all be over.”
