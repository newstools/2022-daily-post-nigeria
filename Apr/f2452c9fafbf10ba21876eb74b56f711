Manchester City midfielder, Ilkay Gundogan, has revealed how Liverpool can “punish” them when the two sides clash in the Premier League on Sunday. The champions welcome the Reds who are one point behind in second place, in what has been billed as a title decider. Jurgen Klopp’s side have won 17 of their last 18 matches in all competitions. City and Liverpool played out a thrilling 2-2 draw earlier in the season at Anfield. Gundogan has now issued a warning on how Liverpool can hurt them at the Etihad. Speaking on Turkish TV Channel, Tivibu Spor, he said: “Liverpool are among the best teams in the world right now. They have achieved incredible form. The league game will be tough. We want to win against them at home. It will be a match between two teams of the same level. We must not make mistakes. “They are a very effective team on the counter-attack. We are a team that loves to play with the ball. If we allow them to make a turnover, they can punish us. We have to be careful.”
