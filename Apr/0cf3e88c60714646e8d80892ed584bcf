Former Chelsea star Tony Cascarino has said that the career of Chelsea’s top midfielder, N’Golo Kante, has come to an end. According to Cascarino the France international will never regain his best form and is burnt out. Kante has been arguably Chelsea’s midfielder since joining the Blues from Leicester in the summer of 2016. But the Frenchman has struggled to maintain his fitness over the course of the last 18 months. Kante looked a shadow of himself against Real Madrid during their Champions League quarter-final first leg in midweek and substituted at the break as veteran midfielders, such as Tony Kroos, Luka Modric and Casemiro ran the show. “I hate to say this, and I’m not sure but have we seen the end of N’Golo Kante as the greatest, or one of the great midfielders in the last decade?” Cascarino posed on talkSPORT. “I do feel like he’s played himself out physically; he looked burned out. “In midweek he was up against a 37-year-old in Modric, Kroos and Casemiro, not all as mobile as him and yet I thought he struggled. “I have looked at N’Golo in the last three months and thought, have we seen the best of him? Is he starting to go on the wane? I hope I’m wrong because he’s been a terrific player.”
