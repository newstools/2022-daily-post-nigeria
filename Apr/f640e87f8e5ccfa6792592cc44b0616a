Former Liverpool defender, Jose Enrique, has given credit to Manchester United’s Paul Pogba after he sustained a knock in the first half of the Red Devils’ Premier League 4-0 defeat to the Reds on Tuesday. Enrique also named Thiago Alcantara as his man of the match following Liverpool’s victory over Man United. Liverpool defeated Man United at Anfield following goals from Luis Diaz, Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah (2). Reacting, Enrique, in a tweet via his Twitter handle after the game, wrote: “Lots of credit to Pogba. He knew what was coming and he said ‘oh my calf’. “My man of the match is Mane for how key he was for us to win today but at the same level I put Thiago today. What a performance by the magician.” The result against Liverpool means Man United are now in the 6th position on the Premier League table with 54 points from 33 games.
