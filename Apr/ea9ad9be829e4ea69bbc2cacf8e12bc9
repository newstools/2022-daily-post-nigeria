The Muslim Rights Concern, MURIC, has mocked pastor Paul Adafarasin of the House on the Rock of over his recent comment concerning the upcoming general elections. Adefarasin on Sunday said there were plans for Christian leaders to get 15 million more voters ahead of the 2023 general election. But In response to this, MURIC insisted that Nigerian Muslims have the overall majority. Backing its eark Muslim rights campaigners said that it was shocking to believe that Christians with their one man one wife doctrine and at most four children in each family, could think they majority over Muslims who are permitted to many wives as possible and have even up to sixteen children in each family. MURIC stated this in a press release signed by its director, Professor Ishaq Akintola and made available to reporters on Monday. “The founder of the House On the Rock, Pastor Paul Adefarasin has allegedly revealed the plan of Christian leaders to get 15 million more voters ahead of the 2023 general election. But Adefarasin must be joking if this is true. Nigerian Muslims have the overall majority,” MURIC said. “There is a grand plot to disenfranchise Muslim voters. They have enrolled their church members as Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) ad hoc staff. They have filled sensitive posts in INEC offices with their church members.” Further raising an alarm, MURIC claimed that Christian leaders would machinery in motion for massive rigging of the presidential election, adding that Muslims would be disallowed from registering as voters before the election. The group claimed that Christians in the country had always used their church members as officials of the electoral umpire to stop Muslims from registering and collecting PVC.
