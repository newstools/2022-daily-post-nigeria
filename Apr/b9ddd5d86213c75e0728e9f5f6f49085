The immediate past Pro-chancellor of Governing Board Council of Federal University of Calabar, and ex-representative of Abia central senatorial district of Abia State, Senator Nkechi Nwaogu has announced her bid to return to the upper legislative chamber of the National Assembly in 2023. DAILY POST recalls that Senator Nwaogu was the Member representing Osisioma Ngwa, Ugwunagbo and Obingwa Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives from 2003 to 2007. In 2007, she was elected as the Senator representing Abia Central Senatorial District. In 2011 she was re-elected for a second tenure in office. While making his intention known during a declaration ceremony on Thursday, Senator Nwaogu hinted that he arrived at the decision after consultation with her family, friends and well wishers. “We should put into consideration that the 90 percent of the current National Assembly leaders are all old timers in the legislature and it is said, the older the better, in terms of legislative know how,” she said. She further insisted that Abia Central must compete favourably with other senatorial districts in Abia State and Nigeria at large.
