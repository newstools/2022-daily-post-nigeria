Former Liverpool and Manchester United striker, Michael Owen, has predicted the outcome of Manchester City’s UEFA Champions League tie with Real Madrid. Manchester City will on Tuesday night host Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final first leg tie at Etihad Stadium. Pep Guardiola’s side head to the game after eliminating Atletico Madrid in the Champions League quarter-final, while Real Madrid knocked Chelsea out of the competition. Providing his prediction, Owen was quoted by BetVictor as saying: “What a tie this should be! City were impressive at the weekend, and they will enter this with some confidence. We all know how desperate City are to win the Champions League, I am expecting a good performance. “Real [Madrid] have done so well to get to this round, but I am not entirely sure how they have done it. Chelsea had plenty of chances to knock them out in the quarters, I don’t think City will be as wasteful. “I will never write off Real in this competition, but I have to favour City. City will keep the ball and I can see them frustrating this Real side. I think Real will score, but I am going for a 3-1 City win.”
