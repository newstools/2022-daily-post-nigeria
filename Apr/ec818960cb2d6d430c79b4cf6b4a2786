Former Premier League star, John Barnes has handed Manchester United the name of a player to sign this summer. Barnes believes Man United should sign West Ham midfielder, Declan Rice, adding that the England international would suit Red Devils. Rice has established himself as a key player for West and has made 189 appearances across all competitions for the club, scoring ten goals and registering nine assists in the process. His contract with the Hammers will expire in 2024, but he could leave the club soon, having been linked with Man United, Chelsea and Man City in the past. “Manchester United would suit Declan Rice because they need his kind of character who will give 100%, has the determination, discipline and desire to run through brick walls. When you are a top player, any of the top clubs will want you,” Barnes told BonusCodeBets. He said: “Declan Rice has to decide for himself where he wants to go. West Ham are an ambitious club in the top six and pushing for the fourth spot, but he must make the decision if he wants to go to a ‘bigger club’. It is not the right time at all for him to move on this summer because West Ham can fulfil his ambitions.”
