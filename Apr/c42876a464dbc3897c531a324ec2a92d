Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has rated the chances of the Red Devils still qualifying for Champions League football next term. The former England defender believes the Red Devils’ hope of finishing top four in the Premier League is all but over. This is following Ralf Rangnick’s controversial 3-1 defeat to Arsenal on Saturday. Nuno Tavares and Bukayo Saka put the home side in the lead at the Emirates, before Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 100th Premier League goal to give United a way back into the game. Bruno Fernandes missed a golden opportunity to level things for United from a spot-kick after referee Craig Pawson awarded a penalty for a Tavares handball. The visitors still had the hope of levelling things up until Granit Xhaka fired a long-range effort past David de Gea to secure back-to-back wins for Arsenal. Speaking on BT Sport, Ferdinand said, “First and foremost, credit to Arsenal they got the job done… they got what is needed at this stage which is the three points. “Manchester United had an opportunity to get back in this game, woodwork, etc and missed a penalty. “Yeah, there’s no way United are going to get in the top four now, there’s no chance.”
