Prof ACB Agbazuere, the Chief of Staff to Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State, has resigned from office. His resignation followed his interest to represent Isiala Ngwa North and Isiala Ngwa South Federal Constituency of Abia at the House of Representatives ahead of the 2023 general election in Nigeria. This is even as Governor Okezie Ikpeazu approved the appointment of Chief Okey Ahiwe as new Chief of Staff on Wednesday. The appointment of Ahiwe was contained in a release signed by Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Barrister Chris Ezem, made available to DAILY POST on Thursday morning, in Umuahia, the state capital. According to the release by Ezem, “this appointment is effective from April 11, 2022.” Recall that Professor Anthony Agbazurere, before appointment and resignation as Chief of Staff to the Abia Governor, served as Commissioner for Information and Strategy under the past administration of ex-Governor, Theodore Ahamefule Orji.
