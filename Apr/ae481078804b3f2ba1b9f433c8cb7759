Manchester United midfielder Fred has reacted to the appointment of Erik ten Hag as his new manager at Old Trafford. The Brazilian described the club’s decision to hire the Dutchman as great news, saying he is excited to play under a ‘world class coach’. Ten Hag will join Manchester United at the end of the season on a three-year contract, with an option to extend for another. He takes over from the interim manager, Ralf Rangnick. Fred has played under four managers – Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Michael Carrick and Ralf Rangnick. He said he is excited about the prospect of Ten Hag at Manchester United. “It’s great news,” the number 17 said to the Premier League. “He’s a world-class coach who will help us a lot here. “I’ve watched Ajax and they are a great team who play good football. We know he helps us a lot and hopefully next year we can win trophies.”
