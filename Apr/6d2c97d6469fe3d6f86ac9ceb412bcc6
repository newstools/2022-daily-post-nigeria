Ahead of the much anticipated 2023 general elections, the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has said the main opposition, Peoples Democratic Party, PDP may lose its relevance if it fails to win the Presidential race. Wike who had declared his intentions to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in the coming presidential election made the claim when he met with stakeholders and delegates of the party in Anambra State on Saturday. The governor urged the party members to jettison sentiments and do everything possible for the party to return to power in 2023. He said he had fought and conquered the ruling All Progressives Congress, asserting he would emerge winner of the presidential election. He said, “I didn’t send anybody to you, because I have respect for you. We have been in the opposition since 2015 and if we don’t win this election in 2023, we can as well forget PDP. And so, everything must be done to win this election. “No sentiment should be brought in and of all the aspirants, whether the person is from Anambra, Sokoto, Imo, look at all of us, who can withstand APC in this election? it is me.”
