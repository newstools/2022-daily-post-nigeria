Title rivals, Rivers United and Plateau United face tricky away fixtures this weekend as they continue their quest to win the Nigeria Professional Football League this season. Leaders, Rivers United will face Kwara United at the Kwara Sports Complex in Ilorin. The Port Harcourt club’s 12-game unbeaten streak was halted by Sunshine Stars last weekend but they bounced back in a superb style thrashing Niger Tornadoes 3-0 in midweek. Stanley Eguma’s side has a four-point lead over second-placed Plateau United who will travel to Uyo to face relegation battlers Dakkada. Third-placed Enugu Rangers will be guests of MFM in Lagos. The Flying Antelopes are in the hunt for a CAF Confederation Cup ticket with Remo Stars, Kwara United and holders Akwa United. Bottom club MFM needs a win to boost their slim survival hopes. At the Okigwe Township Stadium, Heartland will host Abia Warriors in the Oriental derby, while Niger Tornadoes and Kano Pillars will clash in the Northern derby in Minna. The Akure Sports Complex will host the South derby between Sunshine Stars and 3SC. FULL FIXTURES Saturday, April 30
