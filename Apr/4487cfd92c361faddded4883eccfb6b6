About five persons have been reportedly killed in a communal clash between Yoruba residents and the indigenes of Ibeno in Ibeno Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State. The incident, which happened on Wednesday, had property estimated at several millions of naira destroyed. The actual cause of the fracas is yet to be ascertained at press time but a source from the community who pleaded anonymity said the crisis started as a result of a cult clash before turning into an ethnic war. The source noted that the Ilaje people, mostly fishermen, have started fleeing the community through bush paths, while their houses and tents are being looted and destroyed by the hoodlums. However, the State Police Public Relations Officer, Odiko Macdon, when contacted said he was not aware of the crisis but he will find out. He said, “I am not aware but I will find out”. But a Yoruba indigene living in Akwa Ibom State Barr. Oluwajuwon Ogunbiyi, who confirmed the incident described the situation as unfortunate and called on the state government to set up a committee to investigate the crisis. He said, “It is quite unfortunate that this crisis has led to the loss of innocent lives and destruction of properties. The Ibeno community had been a good host over the decades to both indigenes and non-indigenes. Everybody has been living there in harmony without rancour. “I’m therefore using this medium to appeal for peace and an end to hostilities from both warring parties. I also want to call on the Governor of Akwa Ibom State as well as Head of all security agencies in the state to intervene in the matter immediately in order to stem down this waves of violence.”
