About 400 residents from the Kiev suburb of Hostomel are missing after 35 days of Russian occupation, the head of the local military administration, Taras Dumenko said. Dumenko said authorities were currently inspecting basements in the area. He said there is no trace of a local doctor’s husband and son who were taken 12 days ago and the bodies of some unknown people who were killed can also not be found. According to him, several Hostomel residents have been found in Bucha, another Kiev suburb. The discovery of civilian bodies in Bucha prompted international outrage at the weekend. Hostomel is northwest of the capital Kiev and is close to an airfield. The suburb was heavily contested from the start of Russia’s invasion in February and most of its 16,000 residents fled. A few days ago, Ukrainian troops took back control of Hostomel, along with the other Kiev suburbs of Bucha and Irpin.
