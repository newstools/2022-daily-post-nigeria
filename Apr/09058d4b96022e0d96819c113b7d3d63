The Chief of Training and Operations, Defence Headquarters, Maj.-Gen Adeyemi Yekini at the weekend, said the military would not rest until the killers of 15 villagers at Tiortyu, a community in Tarka Local Government Area of Benue, are apprehended. Yekini, who served as the first Commander of Operation Whirl Stroke (OPWS), said he was at Tiortyu to commiserate with the residents of the village over the killing of its residents. Speaking to journalists at the scene where the 15 villagers were slain at Tiortyu, he assured the public that those who carried out the heinous crime would be apprehended and served justice. He was accompanied by the Commander, Operation Whirl Stroke, Maj.-Gen Kevin Aligbe and other top officers of the unit. Yekini regretted the attack, but assured the people that no stone would be left unturned until the perpetrators were brought to justice. He described the perpetrators as bandits and said it was premature to conclude they were herders. “Those that carried out the attacks must be tracked and brought to justice and for me, justice means neutralising them,” he said. In an earlier address to the community leaders, the army chief appealed to the residents to return to their homes and resume their normal business activities. He assured them that no such attacks would be repeated in the area but advised them to report all suspicious movements to the security agents.
