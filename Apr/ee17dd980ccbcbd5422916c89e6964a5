Real Madrid star, Vinicius Junior, has sent a classy message to Reece James following the Los Blancos’ Champions League quarter-final victory over Chelsea on Tuesday night. Real Madrid eliminated Chelsea from the Champions League quarter-final stage on a 5-4 aggregate win. The first leg had ended in a 3-1 victory in favour of Real Madrid at Stamford Bridge last week, while Chelsea won 3-2 in the second leg at the Santiago Bernabeu. Goals from Mason Mount, Antonio Rudiger and Timo Werner put Thomas Tuchel’s side on course for the semi-final. But a late goal from Rodrygo sent the match to extra-time before Karim Benzema scored the winner to send the LaLiga leaders through to the next stage with a 5-4 aggregate victory. During the encounter, James did an impressive job of restricting Vinicius until the Brazilian was finally able to set up Benzema for the winning goal. Vinicius took to social media on Wednesday to congratulate James on his performance after the Chelsea star had thanked Blues fans for their support. “A game full of emotions. We gave everything yesterday. Sometimes in life, everything just isn’t enough,” James tweeted on Twitter. “Thank you for all of your support!” Vinicius replied: “Great game bro. Good luck.” Meanwhile, Vinicius was not the only Real Madrid player to acknowledge James’ efforts in the match. After the game, Benzema rushed to ask James for his shirt as the England star was heading down the tunnel.
