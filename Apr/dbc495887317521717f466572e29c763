A former member of the House of Representatives that represented the Ogoni people of Khana/Gokana Federal Constituency, Hon. Bernard Mikko, has joined the governorship race in Rivers State ahead of the 2023 elections. Mikko, while addressing journalists on Thursday, said that his vision for Rivers State is to harness her resources for urgent and balanced development and economic growth. He said the leadership recruitment process and the emergence of a political office holder account for, to a greater extent, the challenges of poverty, corruption, weak or failed institutions and bad governance. According to him, “As we continue to emphasize the need for good and strong institutions of government, we often overlook the importance of the personal qualities of those who make them work. It is in this regard that I offer myself as a humble servant without blemish to fly the APC flag in Rivers State and bring our party to a resounding victory in the 2023 general election.” Mikko noted that if elected, he would rejig the educational system to produce graduates with relevant technical and entrepreneurial skills that would create jobs and address the social problems and not turn out ineffectual graduates that would merely explain the societal problems rather than dominate and solve them.
