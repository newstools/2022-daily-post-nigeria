At least three persons were allegedly shot to death and several others were abducted by armed terrorists at Rumache Madalla in Bassa/Kukoki ward, Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State. The incident, it was gathered, occurred on Thursday afternoon. Eyewitness accounts said the heavily-armed gunmen stormed the Rumache-Madalla village in their large numbers and unleashed mayhem on unsuspecting victims. Confirming the incident to DAILY POST, Sani Abubakar Yusuf Kokki, co-convener, Concerned Shiroro Youths Of Niger State, said during the deadly encounter, about three people were shot dead while scores of others were abducted and taken to an unknown destination. “Those who sustained multiple gunshots injuries are currently on admission at various medical facilities within relatively secured areas of the local government responding to treatment,” he disclosed. Kokki lamented that kidnapping for ransom has become a common phenomenon in their localities, noting that many villagers are being killed, maimed, and raped among other inhuman subjugation by the terrorists without resistance from the conventional security personnel in the state. According to him, “It is quite unfortunate that we have been forced to coexist with this sad reality. We are being killed, maimed, and raped among other inhuman subjugations by marauding terrorists. “These rampaging criminals attack their victims at will, ironically and unfortunately in some cases without the slightest hindrance, resistance or confrontation from the conventional security. Sadly, defenceless, unarmed and peaceful locals have been crassly abandoned to their fate wallowing in perpetual agony”. “May Almighty Allah urgently come to our rescue, Ameen,” he added.
