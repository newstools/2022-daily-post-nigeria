Reality TV star, Leo Da Silva, has warned against the future dangers of kids begging on the streets of Lekki, Lagos State. Leo lamented that it could grow from strategic begging to strategic robbery if the trend is not stopped. He advised that the kids be taken out of the streets to school in order not to suffer the consequences in the future. Leo made this known on his Twitter page. The tweet reads: ”All these kids on Lekki express, Freedom Way etc need to be in school. They do strategic begging, they know expensive cars and target them. I doubt people that really want to just eat will be doing this. “Let’s put their brains to work or suffer consequences in future. From strategic begging to strategic robbery.”
