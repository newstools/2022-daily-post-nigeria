Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel has admitted that the club’s “marriage” with the returning Romelu Lukaku has not worked so far. However, Tuchel insists Lukaku’s fortunes could still turn around. The Belgium striker returned to Stamford Bridge last summer from Inter Milan, but has so far failed to reproduce his Serie A form. “Lukaku didn’t destabilise us. He is a professional and recently trained very well. “We bought [him] because we believed and still believe in him. “Of course, the marriage hasn’t gone well so far. We have to admit it. But it’s not over – in football everything can change in an instant,” Tuchel said.
