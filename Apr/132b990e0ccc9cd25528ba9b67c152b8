Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has warned Nigerians to be careful with their choice in the 2023 presidential election. He admonished them to ignore politicians who have fed off the government since 1999, warning that they have no positive change to offer the country. Olawepo-Hashim explained in Lagos that many of the said politicians have stayed too long in politics and have become a part of the corrupt system, adding that it is impossible to fight corruption with corruption. He also said the corrupt politicians are spread in both the APC and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and have no productive results aside from convoys and security details paid for with taxpayers’ money. He added that many of them have been cut off from the realities of what Nigerians are facing and have nothing to offer. “I laugh when I read about someone who has never set up even a barber shop in his or her life promising young people employment. These are people who do not even understand how businesses run,” he said. Olawepo-Hashim also said the solution to Nigeria’s security challenges, unemployment, high cost of petroleum prices and other basic things of life is a new approach that cannot be understood by politicians who have lived off government money for years. He disclosed that one of the things that attracted him to the APC is President Muhammadu Buhari’s belief that corruption must be crushed in Nigeria, but added that sadly, corruption has become one of the major reasons for the slow progress, and the underbelly of some of the nation’s security problems such as banditry and kidnapping.
