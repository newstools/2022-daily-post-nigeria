Former Netherlands International, Ruud Gullit has warned Erik ten Hag against taking up the Manchester United job. Gullit claimed that it was a ‘terrible job’ due to the level of scrutiny and pressure from the likes of Rio Ferdinand, Paul Scholes, Gary Neville and other Old Trafford legends. Ten Hag is the frontrunner to take over from Ralf Rangnick, who has been on a temporary basis, at Old Trafford this summer. Gullit warned his compatriot to be aware of what he is walking into, citing the ‘constant pressure’ from the United former players. Speaking on Ziggo Sport, Gullit said, “Is it the right choice? That remains to be seen. It will be a really terrible job. “There are all these former players in the TV studios: Gary Neville, Rio Ferdinand, Paul Scholes… There is constant pressure on the team, that is not easy. “The former players are constantly talking, you have a lot of things on your plate and you have to be able to handle that.”
