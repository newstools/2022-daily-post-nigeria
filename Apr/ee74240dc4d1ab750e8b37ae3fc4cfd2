Will Smith has been banned from the Oscars ceremonies for ten years. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) made the announcement on Friday. He was banned for slapping Chris Rock after the comedian made a joke about his wife, Jada at the Academy awards in March. The actor had apologized for his actions, admitting that his behaviour was “unacceptable, inexcusable” and it left him embarrassed. The statement issued by the Academy said the actor is also not permitted to attend any other events held by Hollywood’s top film group over the next decade. The board, however, did not decide to revoke the best actor Oscar he won last month for “King Richard. A statement issued by the Academy President, David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson, read, “The Board has decided, for a period of 10 years from April 8, 2022, Mr. Smith shall not be permitted to attend any Academy events or programs, in person or virtually, including but not limited to the Academy Awards.” Rubin said the ban is a step towards a larger goal of protecting the safety of its performers and guests, and restoring trust in the Academy.
