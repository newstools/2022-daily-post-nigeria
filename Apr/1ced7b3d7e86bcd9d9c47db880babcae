Reverend David Ajang, the Catholic Bishop of Lafia Diocese, has appealed to Nigerians to desist from promoting self but promote love among themselves for the development of the country. According to him, loving one another irrespective of religion and ethnic differences would ensure peace, unity and promote the development of the country in all spheres of life. Speaking to newsmen in Lafia, Nasarawa after conducting the 2022 Easter Service at Saint Williams Catholic Cathedral, he observed that a lack of patriotism from leaders and followers was responsible for what the country was going through today. According to him, both the leaders and the led have significant roles to play to change the narratives of the country for the better. He opined that “The leaders must be more serious and place the love for the people and the country above the love for themselves and do everything within their power to effect the desired change.” He stated that the leaders on their part must give up selfishness and promote the Nigerian identity rather than promoting individual tribes and religions. He lamented that every Nigerian want change but that all want the next person to change for good and not themselves. The Catholic Bishop said leaders and followers must sincerely change to be better persons for things to work out good in the country. He called on Nigerians to trust God that the seeming victory of evil was temporary believing that in the end, God would manifest his power and good would defeat evil all over the country. He explained that the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ had brought salvation to mankind and man indeed was safe, saying that man should work a blameless life to see God at the end of his life on earth.
