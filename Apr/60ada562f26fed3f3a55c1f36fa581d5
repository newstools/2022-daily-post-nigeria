President Muhammadu Buhari has been urged to sack all Service Chiefs. Deji Adeyanju, an Abuja-based socio-political activist, urged Buhari to sack all Service Chiefs and security heads due to the prevailing oil theft in the Niger Delta region. He lamented that Shell oil company is planning to shut down its operations in Bayelsa and Rivers State due to oil theft. In a chat with DAILY POST, Adeyanju said Shell pumps over 200, 000 barrels of crude oil into pipelines but receives only 3,000 at its Bonny terminal. He disclosed that most of the crude oil are stolen by illegal bunkering. According to Adeyanju, Shell plans to dispose all its onshore assets in Nigeria. He said: “Shell has shut down all land facilities in the Eastern Niger Delta (Bayelsa & Rivers) for about 6 weeks. And there is no plan to restart. “They are pumping over 200,000 barrels of crude into the pipelines and receiving only 3,000 barrels at Bonny terminal. The rest are stolen along the way, illegal bunkering. “Shell is just marking time, waiting to dispose all their onshore assets. Mr. President should sack all Service Chiefs & security heads aiding oil theft in the country.”
