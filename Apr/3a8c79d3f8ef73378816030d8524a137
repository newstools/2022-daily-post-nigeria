Operatives of the Kwara State Police Command, on Thursday, rescued a man identified as Olayinka Segun Owolabi, from a suicide attempt as a result of the economic hardship he claimed to be going through. Olayinka hails from No.54, Ile Alagbede Abutu Oyan, Odo-Otin Local Government Area of Osun State. DAILY POST reports that Police operatives attached to Budo Nuhu police station, Ilorin foiled the attempted suicide at about 1800hours on Thursday. “A passerby sighted what looked like a man hanging on a tree very close to the main road at NASFAT area along checking point bus stop in Ilorin and alerted the police,” the police said. The police reportedly rushed quickly to the scene, loosened the rope around his neck and rushed him to Tobi Hospital, Taiwo Road, Ilorin, where he is responding to treatment. On interrogation, after regaining consciousness, Olayinka, claimed that he was “tired of life, having lost his job and both parents with no help forthcoming from anywhere and without any assurance of the next meal prompted him to decide to end his life.” The Commissioner of Police, Kwara State Police Command, Tuesday Assayomo, advised members of the public, especially parents, guidance and community leaders to always watch and monitor the activities of their children and wards and discharge their duty of care diligently to members of their communities, considering the global economic situation which has no doubt affected negatively the well-being of a large number of the populace. Tuesday Assayomo also urged citizens against taking one’s life, reiterating that any attempt to take one’s life, apart from being against God’s injunction, is also a crime punishable by law if the offender survives the attempt. While promising to always ensure the safety of lives and property of the citizens, the CP warned criminal elements to steer clear of Kwara State, except they want accommodation in the Correctional centres.
