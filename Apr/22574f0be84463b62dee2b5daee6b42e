Nigerian singer, Omah Lay has been sexually harassed by a fan during his performance. Omah Lay, in a viral video, was ‘mounted’ by a drunk female fan who ran on stage for unknown reasons. The incident took place at his ‘Boy Alone’ tour. In the video, the supposed drunk female fan was on top of Omah Lay, while he struggled to remove her from his body. Luckily for him, his security pulled the girl from him in minutes. This is not the first time Omah Lay will be harassed on stage during a performance on his tour. Last week, the singer was given a dirty smackdown by a male fan while he was performing in Australia. Recall that Ruger was also harassed by a female fan some weeks ago, after she groped his manhood while he was performing on stage.
