The Department of State Services (DSS), on Tuesday, alerted members of the public on the need to always be at alert over planned renewed attacks by criminal elements. Peter Afunanya, Public Relations Officer, Department of State Services National Headquarters, Abuja, in a statement on Tuesday, said: “DSS hereby draws public attention to plans by criminal elements to return the country to the pre-2015 era reminiscent of IED attacks on soft and hard targets in parts of the country.” According to him, there are already reported cases of such incidents in some areas, the service has uncovered a ploy by suspected criminal gangs to forge an alliance among themselves. This he said, was to launch further attacks on critical infrastructure and other frequented public places like worship and relaxation centres, especially during and after the holidays and festive celebrations. According to him, their main objective was to achieve some self-serving interests as well as cause fear among the citizenry. “Following these, patrons, owners and managers of aforementioned public places are advised to be wary of this development and implement basic security measures to deter the threats. “While the Service is committed to the disruption of this trend and pattern of violent attacks, it will continue to partner with other security agencies to ensure that necessary drills are emplaced in order that public peace and order are not jeopardized,” the statement said. To this end, residents are enjoined to go about their lawful businesses and share, with security and law enforcement agencies, useful information on the activities of criminals. Meanwhile, the DGSS, Alhaji Yusuf Magaji Bichi, wishes all and sundry a hitch-free Workers’ Day and Sallah celebrations.
