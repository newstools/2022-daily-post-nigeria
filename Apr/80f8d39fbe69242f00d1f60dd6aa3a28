Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations, Senator Jibrin Barau, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for assenting to the bill establishing Federal Polytechnic, Kabo, in Kano State. Senator Barau, in a personally signed statement on Tuesday and made available to journalists in Abuja, said the establishment of the Polytechnic in Kabo which is his home town, would fast track the development of the place aside from affording knowledge seekers the opportunity to learn. “I, Distinguished Senator Barau Jibrin representing the people of Kano North Senatorial District in the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, heartily thank President Muhammadu Buhari for the approval given for the establishment of Federal Polytechnic, Kabo in Kano State. “Myself and the entire people of Kano North Senatorial zone, immensely thank the President for the landmark development brought into the area with attendant multiple multiplier effects. “Education is surely the bedrock of growth and development of any community which Mr President has been promoting with the establishment of a series of tertiary institutions across the country since 2019. “I also commend the Hon. Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu for his untiring efforts in advancing education in this country. We are very grateful to him.” Barau pledged the cooperation of the state government and people of the state with the Federal Government to ensure a smooth take-off of the new polytechnic in October. Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved the establishment of three new polytechnics in various parts of the country. A statement issued on Tuesday, by the Director of Public Relations at the Federal Ministry of Education, said the new institutions will be located in Kano, Abia and Delta states.
