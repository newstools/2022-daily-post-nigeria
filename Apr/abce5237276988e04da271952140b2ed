The chief judge of Rivers State, Justice Simeon Amadi has approved the establishment of an Alternative Dispute Resolution unit in the state judiciary. The unit is to be domiciled within the premises of the Customary Court of Appeal in the state. Amadi said the move is aimed at “decongesting” the regular court. He disclosed this while meeting with a delegation from Babes Bolyai University, Romanian and the University of Port Harcourt on Friday. The Chief Judge also announced the approval for the registration of Multi-Door Court Houses across the Local Government areas of the state. He said judges are being over laboured with cases, explaining that the multi-door court system will reduce the number of cases that come to court. He said, “certain matters will not be brought in the court”. Justice Amadi maintained that the use of Alternative Dispute Resolution will “save time and resources” and remains the easiest means of conflict resolution.
