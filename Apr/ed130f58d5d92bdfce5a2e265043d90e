The National Hospital in Abuja has said only the police would release the report of the autopsy conducted on late gospel singer, Osinachi Nwachukwu. The Chief Medical Director of National Hospital, Abuja, Dr Jeff Momoh, explained that Nigeria Police Force requested Osinachi’s post-mortem examination. The post-mortem examination to discover what killed the Ekwueme crooner is ongoing. However, Momoh said the hospital would not disclose the report to the public. “The report is going to the people who made the request, it won’t be disclosed to the public at all,” Momoh told Vanguard. Osinachi’s death has been widely linked to brutalization by her husband, Peter Nwachukwu. Following her death, Osinachi’s family was said to have demanded that an autopsy be carried out to ascertain the cause of death. Meanwhile, Mr Nwachukwu had absolved himself of any wrongdoing that led to his wife’s death.
