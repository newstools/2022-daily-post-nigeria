Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard has weighed in on the age-old debate of who is the greatest footballer of all time between Manchester United’s forward Cristiano Ronaldo and PSG’s Lionel Messi. The question of who is the greatest man to have played the round leather game has divided football fans, with many opting for Messi or Ronaldo. And Steven Gerrard went for Barcelona legend Messi, who has claimed a record seven Ballon d’Ors – two more than his Portuguese rival. During a Q&A with United legend Gary Neville for The Overlap, the former England captain was asked to state his position on who is the greatest among the two legends. He said: “Lionel Messi for me, but I’m someone who would never say a derogatory thing about Ronaldo because he’s another phenomenal. “They’re the two in my era that were just… when you’re a footballer and you’ve done it yourself, the numbers are just… I’m not sure who’s going to do that again.”
