Uche Edochie, the elder brother of Yul Edochie, has reacted to his brother’s announcement of his second marriage and the birth of his son. DAILY POST had reported that Yul Edochie announced that he married a new wife and she birthed him a son. The development has led to Nigerians declaring Edochie unfit to be Nigeria’s president in 2023. Reacting, Uche on his Instagram page said his family did not support Yul Edochie’s decision and they are shocked. According to him, Yul was advised against the marriage but he did not listen to their advice. Uche Edochie wrote, ”I see two main problems here. His first wife Mary, a wonderful woman and my sister-in-law did not go into a relationship with my brother agreeing to be part of a polygamous marriage. That’s the first problem. So I feel for Mary. ”It is not fair on her. My family are not in support. This is not what we do and we are trying our best to console Mary. What else can we do? The second issue is that Yul is not a Muslim. If he was a Muslim, no one will be talking about this. Muslims marry as many wives as they want and nobody says shit. ”We told Yul not to do it. He did it anyway. Have you ever tried controlling an adult when it comes to relationships? Good luck with that.” Uche further stated that Yul is an adult who feels marrying a second woman is the best way to own up to his mistakes and make things right. ”It is tough. Women throw themselves at famous people so bad that it is suffocating. If the average person walks in Yul’s shoes for one year, they will get five or more women pregnant. So don’t be quick to judge if you have not lived that life. Most people will do worse,” he added. He added that maybe his brother should convert to Islam and shut his circus down.
