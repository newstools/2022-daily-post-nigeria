The Chief Imam of the State House Mosque, Sheikh Abdulwahab Sulaiman, has lamented the spate of terrorism in Nigeria, saying terrorists have taken the religion of Islam as a cover to kill and loot the property of fellow citizens. The Imam, who officiated at the mosque on Monday, to mark the commencement of the Ramadan Tafsir, the interpretation and explanation of the Qur’an, however, prayed to Allah to avert the activities of terrorists, bandits, kidnappers as well as the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic. He lamented what he described as the unforeseen hardships it has brought to the country and global community. Meanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari also joined other Muslim faithful at the State House Mosque to observe the prayers. A terse statement by Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, explained that the prayer session fell in line with Islam’s guiding principles and the intense devotional activities marking the 30-day Ramadan period. He said President Buhari actively participated in calling for prayers for justice, peace, prosperity and enhanced welfare of the whole humanity. “The exercise also emphasized the need for deepening of forgiveness, mercy and kindness to the poor,” Shehu stated. All these came just as the authorities announced the final sack of the Abuja Chief Imam Sheikh Khalid who was believed to have delivered a thought-provoking sermon condemning poor response to the spate of insecurity in the country.
