The Leader Of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele has identified some persons the cabals in the All Progressives Congress, APC, have their sight on for the 2023 Presidency. Primate Ayodele disclosed that the cabals in APC are considering Rotimi Amaechi, the Minister of Transportation and Kayode Fayemi, the Governor of Ekiti State, as the party’s Presidential candidate. A statement by Ayodele’s spokesman, Oluwatosin Osho, said the cabals are also considering someone from the East. He said the cabals plan to bring someone they can control. According to the clergyman, they would deceive President Muhammadu Buhari in picking APC’s next Presidential candidate. He said: “On the candidate for presidency in 2023, the cabals are watching Governor Fayemi, Rotimi Amaechi or they bring someone from the East or south that they can control. “The cabals will deceive President Buhari on the selection of the party’s presidential candidate. These set of people still want to control Nigeria.” The clergyman also warned that the APC may pick the wrong Presidential candidate if the party fails to put its acts together. He advised the ruling party to work on its weakness ahead of the 2023 elections. “The party will pick the wrong choice of candidate if they don’t arrange themselves well. The cabals will deceive President Buhari. ‘’The APC needs to work on their weaknesses, if they want to do it very well to get victory, consensus isn’t the right way to go. “The party will still have court matters to contend with, they will need to be united if at all they want to move far,” he said.
