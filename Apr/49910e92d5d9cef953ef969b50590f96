The National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) has appointed a Caretaker Committee for the Lagos State chapter. National President, Tajudeen Baruwa, made the announcement in a statement on Friday. Baruwa said the nine-man committee will oversee and coordinate operations of the union across the state. The composition followed the dissolution of the State Administrative Council (SAC). The team led by Fatai Adeshina, a stakeholder in the transportation sector, will operate for the next three months as stipulated in the union’s constitution. Members are Sunday Yusuf, Abraham Onifade, Jamiu Erinfolami, Ismaila Ojora, Lekan Ariyibi, Murtala Lawal, Taiwo Azeez. Kayode Agbeyangi is the secretary. “The union knows that they will effectively manage affairs of Lagos chapter after SAC dissolution, which was done to bring sanity to the union’s operation across the metropolis”, Baruwa noted. The NURTW removed Musiliu Akinsanya popularly known as MC Oluomo in March. The Lagos government later appointed him as Parks Management Committee Chairman. A former Assistant Inspector General of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, named the Liaison Officer between the government and the committee.
