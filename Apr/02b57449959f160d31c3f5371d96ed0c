Ahead of the 2023 Presidential election, Imo West Senator, Rochas Okorocha has said the choice of President Muhammadu Buhari may surprise Nigerians. Okorocha said Buhari’s choice of a possible successor might surprise Nigerians because he is unpredictable. Speaking with Channels Television, Okorocha, the Presidential aspirant, said Buhari will consider certain factors before endorsing any politician for the 2023 presidency. According to Okorocha: “But if you know President Muhammadu Buhari, he is a general. You can’t predict him. He is so unpredictable that you cannot predict what he will do. He might pull anybody by surprise anytime. “That gives him the military training that he has. Anybody (referring to presidential hopefuls) that meets him, whatever he says to A, the same thing he will say to B. “If anybody comes out to say, Buhari has endorsed him, the person will not be saying the truth. The president may have his preferred candidate in his chest. He has not made that known to anybody. “The President Buhari, I know, will want to check the mood of the nation. He will also consider the interest of the people. “He will also consider who can win the election for the party. President Buhari in making his decision will be guided by so many issues that he has to consider.”
