A cheque of N4.2m each have been presented to the next-of-kin of seven policemen killed by terrorists in Zamfara State by the state Police Command. Mr Ayuba Elkanah, the Commissioner of Police who presented the cheques on behalf of the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba said the move is part of the IGP’s family insurance welfare scheme given to the families of slain policemen and officers who died in active service. The Commissioner of Police explained that the assistance would help in alleviating the suffering the families of the slain police officers are faced with. The Commissioner of Police told the IGP that the personnel of the command would continue to do their best towards ensuring peace, security and safety of the state and the country in general. Mr Ayuba Elkanah enjoined the families of the slain officers to ensure judicious use of what is offered to them for the upkeep of their families. He explained that the Command received similar cheques from the IGP in the past five months and had presented same to the beneficiaries. The Commissioner of Police said, “This will serve as a morale booster to the serving members of the force to continue to discharge their duties effectively.”
