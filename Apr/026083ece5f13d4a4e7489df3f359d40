The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rep. Femi Gbajabiamila, has said that the current security challenges in the country are threats to the foundations of Nigeria as a nation. The lawmaker, however, noted that the Federal Government of Nigeria has responded to the challenges by taking necessary measures such as recruiting personnel for security agencies and increasing funding for the police and the military, among others. The Speaker stated this when he delivered a paper titled ‘Democracy in Challenging Times: The Role of African Parliaments in Safeguarding and Delivering on the Dividends of Democracy’ at the School of Oriental Studies, London on Wednesday as part of his ongoing official visit to the UK. He said, “The most pressing of these challenges today is the national security crisis that threatens the foundations of our nationhood and portends great danger for Africa and the world if it persists. “The government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has responded to the reality of our present challenges by increasing funding provisions for the police and armed forces, accelerating recruitment and training to put more boots on the ground and also acquiring weapons systems designed to give the security agencies an advantage.”
