A youth leader, Victor Amasi, has been reported killed by security personnel in Onne community in the Eleme Local Government Area of Rivers State. The youth leader was allegedly shot dead during an election of the Onne Youth Council on Monday. Sources claimed that the police officer was one of those deployed to the area to ensure a peaceful electoral process. But the election was later suspended by the electoral committee after receiving “directives” from authorities in the area. An eyewitness said the suspension of the election led to chaos and eventually a “protest to the traditional leaders” of the community. The election was contested by David Osarobe, Tobiah Silas Tete and Samuel Owinkpe. He said the traditional leaders, after considering the situation, “declared David Osarobe as the winner of the election” which led to wild jubilation during which a stray bullet from the security personnel hit Amasi who died on his way to the hospital. In the meantime, the Rivers State Police Command has dismissed the report that the deceased was shot by a police officer. The spokesman of the command, Grace Iringe Koko, while acknowledging that the command was yet to receive a report of the death at the time of this report, dissociated the police from the shooting. According to her, “they were fighting among themselves and there were other security agencies including the DSS, Army and Civil Defence there, so police did not shoot. “I wonder who is not a friend to the police that wants to frame the police that they were the one that shot”.
