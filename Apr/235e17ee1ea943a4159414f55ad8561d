Apostle John Okoriko, the General Overseer of Solid Rock Kingdom Church, who was kidnapped on Tuesday in his church premises, has been freed. DAILY POST reports that Apostle Okoriko was whisked away from his church premises in Mpat Enin Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State. It was gathered that the kidnappers used the handset of their victim’s driver, which was snatched during the operations to communicate with the family to demand for N100m ransom to secure his freedom. However, when the family could not afford the ransom, reduced it to N30m and later slashed it to N10m on Friday afternoon. However, it was not clear whether the amount was paid before he was released or not. Meanwhile, the Pastor has reunited with family members as the first son, Levi Okoriko confirmed the development on his Facebook page. “Our lion has come out stronger than before. He will continue to roar with the new strength.” Also, Police Public Relations Officer, Odiko Macdon, who confirmed the release of the pastor, however, did not say whether ransom was paid or not. “I can confirm that Apostle John Okoriko has been released but I don’t have any information at my disposal whether any ransom was paid,” Macdon said.
