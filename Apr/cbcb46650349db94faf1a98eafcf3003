Chelsea midfielder, Mateo Kovacic, has identified Luka Modric as the Real Madrid player he would like to have in the Blues squad. Kovacic said he admired Modric, adding that the midfielder is an amazing player. He said this on Monday during his pre-match press conference ahead of Chelsea’s Champions League quarter-final second leg tie with Real Madrid on Tuesday. Kovacic and Modric are both international teammates with Croatia national team. “It’s quite difficult to stop [Luka Modric],” Kovacic said. “He is an amazing player. I admired him when I was a child when he played for my favourite club, Dinamo Zagreb. “He has always been as good as he is now. As long as I have known him, he has remained on the same level, which is amazing. He loves football so much. He is a professional. If he keeps going like this, I see him playing for [another] three or four years. “It was nice and difficult to play against him, but it is never nice when you are losing. I always prefer to have him on my team. This moment we are against each other, and we are ready to show our best tomorrow to try to go through.”
