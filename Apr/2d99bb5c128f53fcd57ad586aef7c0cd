Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has explained why he dropped Mohamed Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold for Saturday’s early kick-off at Newcastle United. Klopp has made changes to the team that beat Villarreal 2-0 in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final in midweek. But with Liverpool, just one point behind league leaders Manchester City, victory against the Magpies would see Klopp’s side go top, temporarily at least. Five changes have been made to the team that beat Villarreal, with Salah, Alexander-Arnold, Thiago, Fabinho and Ibrahima Konate dropping out of the starting XI. James Milner, Naby Keita, Joe Gomez, Diogo Jota and Joel Matip all come in to face Eddie Howe’s side. Klopp told BT Sport ahead of kick-off at St James’ Park: “We have to do it [rotation] because of the intensity of the period we are in. “We could have changed it even more but it’s about rhythm and stability.”
