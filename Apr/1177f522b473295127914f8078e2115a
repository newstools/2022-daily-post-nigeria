Former Governor of Rivers State and 2023 presidential aspirant, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, has told Nigerians just one question to ask politicians whenever they come with fake promises. The Minister of Transportation said that Nigerians should learn to use the question “how” to deflect politicians who would come to seek their votes with promises they cannot fulfil. Speaking in a separate visit to the government and delegates of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Ondo and Ekiti states, Monday, Amaechi also said he was thinking about a Nigeria where both Muslims and Christians could cohabit without segregation. “One question you should always ask politicians is ‘how?’ like everybody is saying now, ‘I will create employment.’ How do you create employment? They will all come and say ‘I will create wealth.’ Your question should be ‘how?’
“That’s how to catch a politician. “I’m a Christian, when we were running in 2015, the story was Christian versus Muslim, and I said no, that is a depiction they use to deceive us from facing reality. “Today, what I preach is a united Nigeria, a Nigeria where Muslims will feel free to stay in Edo or Ondo, and where an Ondo man who is not a Muslim will be free to live in Kano. “That’s the Nigeria I think about, that’s the Nigeria we should be asking for. We should not wait for them [other aspirants]to bring money. If they bring, you take. “This is not time for grammar, this is time for practice. If anybody comes to speak grammar, let him show you evidence. “That’s why I put the word on your mouth ‘how?’ it’s a basic word you can use to reduce anybody to the barest minimum.” Amaechi is one of the members of the ruling APC who has declared their intentions to run for the presidency come 2023. Other notable figures are Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, national leader of the party, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Gov. Dace Umahi of Ebonyi State, Rochas Okorocha, among others.
