Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick has insisted he has no regrets about taking the job. Rangnick replaced Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on a temporary basis last December. The German will hand over to Solskjaer’s permanent successor this summer, before taking up a two-year consultancy role at Old Trafford. Rangnick’s appointment was meant to spark a sort of revival at United, but he has won only nine of his 22 matches in charge and the team is struggling to qualify for the Champions League. They go into Saturday’s game against bottom side Norwich, sitting in seventh place in the Premier League, six points outside the top four. However, Rangnick insists he does not regret taking the job, but admits he is not happy with how things have panned out so far. “No. No regrets whatsoever. I would do it over and over again,” he told reporters. “I don’t regret that at all. As a manager you always have to question and ask yourself what you could have done better, if I could have played with a different formation in certain games, if a substitution could have been done earlier. This is what always happens: we always ask ourselves questions- what we could have done better.”
