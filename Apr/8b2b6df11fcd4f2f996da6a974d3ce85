Former Super Eagles technical adviser, Austin Eguavoen, has given the reason Ghana qualified for the 2022 FIFA World Cup ahead of Nigeria. Eguavoen said the Black Stars qualified for this year’s World Cup in Qatar because they wanted it more than Nigeria. According to him, the Super Eagles lacked character and courage in the second leg against Ghana in Abuja. Recall that Ghana qualified for the World Cup ahead of Nigeria by away goal after drawing 1-1 at the MKO Abiola Stadium in the second leg playoff last month. “We lacked the character, zeal to beat Ghana when it mattered most,” Eguavoen said during SuperSports’ program, Monday Night Football. “The Ghanaians showed they wanted it more than our boys and that was why it ended that way. We did not do any of that. We didn’t fight or push enough for the winner and how do you do that? It’s with fast-paced football, creating chances but that did not happen. “In Kumasi, the Ghanaians were better but in Abuja, the Eagles were the better side but could not win. “The games between Ghana and Nigeria are always very difficult. If we had lost in Kumasi or in Abuja, I would have regarded myself as a failure but we lost on away goal. We did not lose the game but we lost the ticket to qualify for the World Cup.”
