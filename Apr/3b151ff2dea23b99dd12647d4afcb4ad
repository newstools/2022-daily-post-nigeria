Reality Tv star, Ka3na has said the devil is destroying marriages in recent days. The reality star was reacting to the news of the marriage issues between Nkechi Blessing and her husband. Nkechi’s husband, Opeyemi Falegan had earlier confirmed their split stating he can no longer be the husband to a lesbian. Reacting, Ka3na who recently announced a split with Mr Jones and relocated to London with her daughter on Instagram advised that everyone stay unmarried. Her post read: “How about we all stay unmarried and simply love ourselves? Let’s see marriages the devil will destroy again. Respectfully.” She, however, prayed for those in bad marriages to be free of the devil. “Surely the devil is up against everything beautiful this period and hopefully this too shall pass over us. My prayers are with every home under the influence of the devourer,” Ka3na said.
