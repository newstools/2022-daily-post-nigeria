Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, on Saturday, promised to make 20 million Nigerians millionaires, if elected President in 2023. Bello disclosed this while declaring his intentions to run for the Presidency in 2023. The governor had declared his intentions to run for the Presidency at the Eagles Square in Abuja. He promised to build on the legacy of President Muhammadu Buhari by creating 20 millionaires in the country by 2030. Bello disclosed that each of the 20 millionaires would empower five other Nigerians. The Presidential aspirant recalled how reports claimed that over 100 million Nigerians lived in extreme poverty during the administration of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. He noted that the Buhari-led administration reduced the figure to 70 million. He said: “In 2018, with APC in the saddle that figure has dropped to about 87m people yet Nigeria overtook India as the poverty capital of the world. Just this month, Nigeria through the effort of the President relinquished the title back to India and brought down the figure to about 70m people. “It is therefore clear that our path to national prosperity lies in pulling millions of Nigeria out of poverty. “The Buhari administration has a target of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty by the year 2030. A Yahaya Bello presidency will have an additional target of creating 20 million naira millionaires by the same year 2030 with the aim that each of them will empower five other citizens.”
