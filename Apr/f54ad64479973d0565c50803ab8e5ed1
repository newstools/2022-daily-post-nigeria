Former Super Eagles winger, Finidi George, has been named as one of the assistant coaches of the Nigeria national team. This is pending the appointment of a new head coach for the three-time African champions. George, who is the current head coach of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL), Enyimba, was approved for the Eagles job on Thursday by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). A statement from the NFF added that “a new head coach, for the Super Eagles will be announced and officially unveiled once the processes for his engagement and contract-signing are concluded.” Finidi George will be a second assistant coach, while Salisu Yusuf (whenever he is available from Super Eagles B/U23 Team duties) will be the first assistant.
