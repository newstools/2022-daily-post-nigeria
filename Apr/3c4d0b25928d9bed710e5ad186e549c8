Real Madrid goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois has urged Chelsea’s eventual new owners to be aware they are buying ‘one of the best clubs in the world’. Courtois will be back on his old Stamford Bridge stomping ground when Real Madrid take on Chelsea in tonight’s UEFA Champions League quarter-final first leg tie. Currently there are four rival consortiums locked in negotiations to buy Chelsea from Roman Abramovich, who is selling the Premier League giants amid Russia’s continued invasion of Ukraine. And Courtois has now called on Chelsea’s suitors to keep the West London club at the top of the world game. “I think it has been a hard month for the club [Chelsea] and for the fans, but I think you can see that all the people that love Chelsea are really putting all their energy together,” Courtois was quoted by Chelsea’s official website as saying. “The new owners must know what club they’re buying. And hopefully they can keep that spirit that has always been here. “In total I was part of Chelsea for seven years, and that was a big part of my career,” he said. The Belgium international added: “They gave me the chance to grow myself, to come back and to learn with Petr Cech. And I won two Premier League titles, so I am always happy to come back here. “I hope the new owners will understand what they are buying and that Chelsea can remain as one of the best clubs in the world.”
