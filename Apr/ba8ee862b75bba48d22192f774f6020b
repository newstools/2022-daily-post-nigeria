Parading Odusanya among other suspects in Osogbo on Wednesday, the Field Commander, Osun Amotekun Corps, Amitolu Shittu disclosed that the suspect, who is a ritualist, was arrested for exhuming and extracting tooth from dead bodies at a burial ground at Ilesa, with the intention of using it for money ritual purposes.
