Cross River State Governor, Professor Ben Ayade has declared his intentions to run for president in 2023, following a consultative visit to President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday. Ayade who met with President Buhari behind closed doors said he got a commitment from the president to go ahead and run if he has the qualities, but he must consult widely with leaders of the party from the south-south region. The Cross River Governor who recently defected from the opposition Peoples Democratic Party to the All Progressive Congress said he would concentrate on power, security and economic challenges if he becomes the President. He, however, said he would not hesitate to align with any candidate of Buhari’s choice, so as to consolidate on the modest achievements of the APC. Reacting to the possibility of former President Goodluck Jonathan also declaring for the presidency from the same zone and how that would affect his ambition, Ayade said he would gladly support Jonathan if he is the anointed candidate of the party.
