Donald Ojogo, the Ondo State Commissioner for Information, has resigned from Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu’s cabinet ahead of the 2023 general elections. Ojogo’s resignation comes after Akeredolu issued political appointees in the state who will be running in the upcoming elections a 48-hour deadline to resign. He is vying for a House of Representatives seat in the Ilaje/Ese-Odo Federal Constituency. Ojogo’s resignation, according to his letter to the governor, will take effect on Thursday, April 14, 2022. While thanking Akeredolu for his support during his tenure in office, he guaranteed that his political bonding with the governor had only just begun.
