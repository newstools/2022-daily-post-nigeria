The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has admitted he was in “deep sorrow” after his son Dare died last year. Dare passed on during his sleep on May 4, 2021, in Eket. He was 42. Until his death, he pastored an RCCG church in Akwa Ibom state. Speaking at the international headquarters of the church along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway during the April 2022 Holy Ghost Service of the church on Friday, Adeboye revealed how he got over his sadness. The respected cleric said a text message from one of his spiritual daughters turned the tide. He said, “When I lost my son last year (2021), then I was deeply in sorrow, I got a text (message) from one of my (spiritual) daughters that suddenly turned the tide. “What she wrote was simply this: Daddy, let God carry you.”
