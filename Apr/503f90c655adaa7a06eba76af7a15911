Paris Saint-Germain superstar, Lionel Messi has told the club to snap up Luka Romero from Lazio. The Serie A club signed Romero from Real Mallorca last year, but are yet to introduce him in the first team. However, Romero’s reputation has grown a lot since that and PSG are keen to get the youngster this summer. LaLazioSiamoNoi.it reports that Messi is driving the move and has recommended his compatriot to the Ligue 1 giants. Lazio have not received any offers for the 17-year-old yet, but he will cost around €20 million. Romero’s current contract expires in 2023 and he cannot sign a five-year deal until he’s 19.
