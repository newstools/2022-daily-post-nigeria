Three persons have reportedly died in a fatal road crash involving a saloon car and an 18-seater bus along Jakusko-Gsahu’a highway in Yobe State in the early hours of Sunday. This is in addition to many sustaining varying degrees of life-threatening injuries. The vehicles coming from opposite directions were said to have involved in a head-on collision due to over-speeding and instantly went up in flames, according to an eyewitness. The deceased namely: Malam Usman Bahago Arfani, Adamu Umar Sanda and Abba Saleh Abba Kyari Gashua, were said to be occupants of the saloon car and are all Indigenes of Gashu’a town. It was also gathered that many passengers from the commercial bus have sustained injuries mainly from fire burns and were taken to Jakusko General Hospital for medical treatment. This came barely 24 hours after the Federal Road Safety Corps in a Ramadan Message called on Nigerians to fully obey all road traffic regulations established by the government for the maintenance of sanity on the roads.
