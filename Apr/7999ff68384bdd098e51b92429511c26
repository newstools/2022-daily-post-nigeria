A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Imo State, Uche Nwosu, has said that it was unfair for some southern politicians to accuse the north of trying to retain power while they have refused to support the southeast to produce the next president. According to Nwosu, such politicians are not sincere to themselves, insisting that it was actually the turn of the people of the southeast region to produce the next president of Nigeria. The former Imo State governorship aspirant said that those agitating for power shift to the south without supporting the southeast in 2023 are being unfair. Nwosu said it was double standard to deny the southeast, being the only zone which has never produced the country’s president, the opportunity to do so. The former governorship candidate spoke with select journalists in Abuja, Wednesday, where he insisted that the only way equity and justice can be truly served is for other zones in the South to support the Southeast. He said that anyone coming to equity must come with clean hands, adding that it was wrong “to be agitating for power shift to the south on the guise of equity and justice and when power moves to the south you no longer preach equity and justice, that is simply unfair.” He argued that “When our brothers from the South West or South-South come out to say they want to be President for equity and justice sake, they are simply not fair, there is no equity or justice in that. “The true equity and justice is to make sure that every zone in this country will have the opportunity to rule this country, that is the peace, that is the equity, that is the justice for me. “If you are accusing the North, that the North doesn’t want to release power to the South and you that have tasted power in the South, want to take power again, you’re not sincere.”
