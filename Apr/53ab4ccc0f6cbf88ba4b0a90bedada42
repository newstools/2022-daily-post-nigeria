The Chief Imam of Muslim Foundation Juma’at Mosque Gusau, Zamfara State capital, Sheikh Tukur Sani Jangebe, who is also the state Commissioner for Religious Affairs has called on wealthy individuals in the state to come to the aid of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and the less privileged. Jangebe made the call while delivering his Ramadan sermon in Gusau, advising wealthy people to cultivate the culture of helping the needy and less privileged ones. Speaking further, he urged Muslims to intensify prayers for peace and harmony in the state and the country at large, especially now that the terrorists have declared war against the state and the entire country. Sheikh Jangabe cautioned Muslims against rumour mongering and other dubious acts, pointing out that Allah forbids such acts in this holy month of Ramadan.
