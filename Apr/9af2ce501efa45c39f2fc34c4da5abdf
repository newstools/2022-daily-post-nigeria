Arsenal legend, Paul Merson, has warned Manchester United against appointing Erik ten Hag as their next permanent manager. Merson said Ten Hag doesn’t know the English Premier League (EPL), adding that Man United will be making a big risk if they appoint the Dutchman to take over from interim boss, Ralf Rangnick in the summer. Ten Hag, who is currently in charge of Ajax, has emerged as the favourite candidate among senior figures at Old Trafford to replace Rangnick at the end of the season. Manchester United have spoken to Ten Hag and Paris Saint-Germain’s Mauricio Pochettino, but it appears that the former will be in charge of the Red Devils next season. And Merson believes Ten Hag is not the right manager to coach Man United. “Manchester United are taking a big risk if they appoint Erik ten Hag as manager,” Merson told Starsport. “The players know now that their manager is not going to be in charge next season. But Ten Hag is not the answer for me. “He is coming from a club that is in a two-team league where you dominate every match. He doesn’t know this league. “I think it’s a gamble. You can’t win anything without a good manager and I’m not sure how good a manager Ten Hag is.”
