A suspected kidnapper identified as Paul has been apprehended by members of a local vigilante group in Rumuagholu community in Obio Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State. The suspect was arrested on allegations of kidnapping a 14-year-old teenage girl who he allegedly kept in his custody for over 3 weeks. The guardian of the teenage girl, Queeneth Ukwuegbu said they have been “searching for the girl for over three weeks” and that the suspect is a customer of hers. Ukwuegbu said she alerted the local vigilante as soon as the teenage girl was able to reach her on phone, which led to the arrest of the suspect. According to her, the victim confided in her that she “was raped by two men” while she was with the suspect. Speaking to journalists, the suspect said he took the “girl to his house for safety” after he picked her around Obirikwere Bridge in Port Harcourt. Meanwhile, the leader of the local vigilante group, Henry Nyebuchi said the man has been handed over to the police for further investigation. He said “If you had seen a girl along the road, according to what he claimed, the right place to take the girl is the police station. “This is a clear case of abduction, conspiracy and rape because the girl admitted that some people raped her”.
