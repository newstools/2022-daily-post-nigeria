The United Nations Electoral Assistance Division (UNEAD) in Nigeria visited the All Progressives Congress (APC) leadership on Wednesday. The delegation led by Serge Kubwimana called for a peaceful and inclusive process ahead of the 2023 elections. APC National Secretary, Iyiola Omisore received the team at the party headquarters in Abuja. Kubwimana addressed the media alongside APC National Publicity Secretary, Felix Morka; Director of Organisation, Ussiju Medaner; and other UNEAD members. The team leader said they had a UN mandate to assess the context in which the polls would take place and find out the areas the world body could contribute. “We have conferred with the APC National Secretary on behalf of the National Chairman”, he told reporters. “We have done the same with INEC, government, civil society organizations, major political parties, faith-based organizations, an inter-party advisory council to name a few. “We are here to express our intent to contribute to a peaceful and inclusive process next year and to see where we can be of value.” Kubwimana noted that Nigeria has strong institutions and the ability to run its elections. He said Nigeria is not the only place where there are issues around elections and assured of the UN’s continued support for member states.
