Another Improvised ‎Explosives Device, IED, has been discovered in Shanono area of Rigasa, Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna, less than 24 hours after residents found one. Residents scampered for safety after news spread that the device was found in a jerrycan covered with a black waterproof bag, Friday morning. A resident, Ali Umar, said children in the community called the attention of elders in the community after they found a jerrycan covered with a black bag. “It was kept at the same spot where the Thursday IED was discovered. We don’t know what is happening in this community. It was my elder brother’s wife that rushed to inform me that the children found another bomb inside Jerrycan,” he said. Spokesman of the State Police Command, ASP Mohammed Jalige, who confirmed the news, said an anti-bomb squad have been deployed to the area. “The area has been cordoned off to protect the people from getting hurt while our men are there to defuse the device,” he said. He urged people to be more vigilant wherever they are in the state.
