Ramadan fasting continues in Saudi Arabia as the 2023 Shawwal moon is yet to be sighted as earlier projected, Daily Trust reports. The development indicates that since fasting continues on Sunday, the Eid-ul-Fitr would probably take place on Monday. Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) had in a statement, urged Muslim faithful to be on the look out for moon on Saturday. The President General of NSCIA, and Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar III said the moon, if sighted on Saturday, would mean Sunday is a day of ‘Idul Fitr. “If the crescent is sighted by Muslims of impeccable character, then His Eminence (Sultan) would declare Sunday, May 1st 2022, as the 1st of Shawwal and the day of ‘Idul Fitr. However, if the crescent is not sighted that day, then Monday, May 2nd 2022, automatically becomes the day of ‘Idul Fitr”, the statement added.
