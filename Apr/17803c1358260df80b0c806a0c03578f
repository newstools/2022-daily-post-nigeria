Rivers United boosted their chances of winning the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) title, with a 2-0 win over Enyimba on Monday. Ishaq Rafiu and Chiamaka Madu both scored in the first half, as the Pride of Rivers silenced the People’s Elephant at the Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium. Enyimba came into the game buoyed by their triumph over Enugu Rangers, while Rivers United were on an 11-game unbeaten streak. This result leaves the Aba club in ninth position on the table, ahead of their next fixture against Kano Pillars on April 20. With the victory, Rivers United extended their lead to eight points after 23 matches. They play Sunshine Stars next at the Ondo State Sports Complex.
