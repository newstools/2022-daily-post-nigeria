One week after bandits attacked a train with 362 passengers on board, the whereabouts of over 160 passengers remain unknown. DAILY POST recalls that bandits had killed eight people and injured 26 others in the Monday night attack. Though the Kaduna State Government, through the Commisoner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, said it has received the luggage of the Ill-fated victims, it was silent on their whereabouts. Though the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir El-rufai had confirmed to the state House Correspondent in Abuja that bandits have contacted the families of abducted victims, they are yet to request for ransom. Many victims’ families who are anxious to know the whereabouts of their loved ones faulted the explanation. They wondered that if their loved ones are alive, what stops the bandits from not requesting for ransom seven days after they were kidnapped. One of the victims’ family, Mr. Joseph Madaki said he will never believe anyone, until he sees his brother. According to him, he received calls, but since he did not receive further calls since the abduction, he has started to have doubts. Also, John Bulus who said two of his friends were among alledged abducted victims, said he knew no sleep since the incident. “Each time the matter comes to my mind, I feel worried. Bandits will abduct several people, for days, without asking for ransom?” He asked tearfully. However, in an update on Saturday, Managing Director of the Nigeria Railway Corporation, Engr. Fidet Okhiria, confirmed that a total of 362 passengers boarded the ill-fated train. According to him, while 170 were safe, 21 were missing, but he was silent on the fate of the remaining 171.
