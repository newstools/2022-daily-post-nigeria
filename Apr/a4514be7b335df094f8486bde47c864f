Gunmen, on Tuesday night, stormed Dorayi village of Dutsen Abba ward community, Zaria Local Government Area of Kaduna State, killed one person and abducted his 15-year-old daughter. A resident in the area, Mallam Yunusa Idris told DAILY POST in Kaduna that the gunmen came around 2 a.m., Wednesday, and were shooting sporadically. He gave the name of the deceased as Alhaji Abdullahi Ardo, while his daughter, Mariya was abducted. According to him, “the bandits went straight to his room and killed him. From there, they went away without further attack on any house or person. “We feel they purposely came to pick Alhaji Ardo, and when they attempted, he might have showed some resistance, that’s why they shot him and then abducted his daughter.” DAILY POST recalls that the community has witnessed series of attacks in recent past, as many people have been abducted and others killed. The Police Spokesman in the State, ASP Mohammed Jalige did not pick his calls, just as he did not respond to a text message sent to him.
