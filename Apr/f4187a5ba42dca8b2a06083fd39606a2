Barcelona manager, Xavi Hernández has said that his team failed to beat Eintracht Frankfurt in the UEFA Europa League, UEL, quarter-final first-leg tie on Thursday because the German club made it difficult for the LaLiga giants. Xavi explained that his players struggled to perform on a difficult pitch at the Waldstadion on Thursday night. Goals from Ansgar Knauff and Ferran Torres ensured both Frankfurt and Barca played to a 1-1 draw. Speaking at his post-match press conference, Xavi said: “They are physically strong, dangerous on the counter-attack, and they created [chances] but were not able to take advantage of them. “It’s a difficult pitch, a complicated pitch [to play on]. The grass wasn’t in the best condition, and it made it difficult for us. “I think the pitch will be better for the second leg. Today the ball did not move well. That’s another reality and it costs us. You had to do one more touch and everything slowed down. “Well, at the Camp Nou, it will be different.”
