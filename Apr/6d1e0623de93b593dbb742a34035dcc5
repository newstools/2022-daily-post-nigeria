Arsenal loanee, Pablo Mari, has sent a clear message to the Gunners and its manager Mikel Arteta that he wants to stay in Italy. Mari, who is currently on loan at Italian club Udinese from Arsenal, said the Serie A is the best league for him. The defender joined Udinese in January on a loan deal for the remainder of the season after failing to secure a regular role under Arteta. Mari joined Arsenal on an initial loan deal from the Brazilian side Flamengo before the move was made permanent for a £7 million fee in 2020. The 28-year-old still has two years remaining on his contract with Arsenal. Mari is expected to head back to Arsenal at the end of the season following his loan deal, but he has now indicated that he would prefer to stay in Udinese. “When I arrived in January, I had a clear and precise idea,” Mari told Gazetta dello Sport. “I told the coach and [club owner] Gino Pozzo that I was coming to play. But I realized that I had to earn the job day after day, workout after workout. [Head coach] Cioffi was the first who welcomed me, well, here. “It’s the right league for me. Very tactical. I try to bring the attacker towards me. “I really like having the ball and here it can be done and then there is the battle and I like having a battle on the pitch. I would like to stay in Italy.” He added: “I’m very well at Udinese and I would be happy to take the club even higher in the standings. Of course, I still have a two-year contract with Arsenal. “I have resumed playing continuously after the operation on my left ankle where I was out for five months.”
