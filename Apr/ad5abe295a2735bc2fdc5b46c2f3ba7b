The Zamfara State Upper Shari’a court in Guasu has sentenced three women suspected to have desecrated the Holy Qur’an to 5 years and six months in prison after finding them guilty of the charges. They are Rani Bello, Hazira Bello and Hafsatu Isah who were imprisoned for three offences in accordance with sections 122,123, and 287 of Zamfara State Shari’a penal code which stipulated six months imprisonment, two years imprisonment and three years imprisonment respectively. The khadi, however, said they have the right to appeal to the Sharia Court of Appeal within 14 days. The Khadi, Garba Sahabi Gusau said the court ruled based on the evidence and witnesses presented before it as well as the inability of the accused persons and their council to produce witnesses of protection against the court charges. When interviewed shortly after the court judgement, the counsel to the accused persons, Jamilu Ashafa said they were not satisfied with the judgement, saying they would proceed to the Shari’a court of appeal as granted. Ashafa said the judgement delivered was contrary to the Islamic legal system as the five male witnesses presented before the Shari’a court were not sufficient to pronounce judgement looking at the provision of the Islamic shari’a.
