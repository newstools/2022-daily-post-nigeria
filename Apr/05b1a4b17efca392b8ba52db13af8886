Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand has identified Fernandinho as Manchester City’s ‘vulnerability’ in their thrilling 4-3 victory over Real Madrid. Manchester City were able to defeat Real Madrid with one goal advantage going into the second leg in Spain. Pep Guardiola’s side were in control for the majority of the game, with goals from Kevin De Bruyne, Gabriel Jesus, Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva giving them a slim advantage ahead of the reverse fixture. However, Karim Benzema’s goals and a superb individual effort from Vinicius Jr kept the Spanish side in the game. Vinicius had a subdued first half, but grew into the game after Pep Guardiola substituted John Stones for Fernandinho Ferdinand believes Fernandinho represented City’s biggest weakness in the first leg. “I think a big, big change in the way the game went was when Stones coming off,” he told BT Sport. “Unfortunately, Fernandinho at 36 years old having to play right-back against one of the most in-form wingers in the game at the moment, that was a vulnerability then in that Man City team,” he said. Meanwhile, Real Madrid boss, Carlo Ancelotti has warned Pep Guardiola and his City side, saying that the Galaticos play better and compete more inside the Santiago Bernabeu. The Italian said by scoring 3 goals at the Etihad, Real Madrid has opened up the game and now dream of playing in the final.
