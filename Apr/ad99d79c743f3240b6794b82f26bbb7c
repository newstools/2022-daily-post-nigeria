A road accident claimed five lives on Wednesday along the Lagos-Ibadan expressway. DAILY POST reported earlier that two persons were burnt beyond recognition when a commercial bus somersaulted and caught fire. About three hours later, another road crash was said to have occurred around Kara, killing five of the eight persons involved and injuring one. It was gathered that a Toyota Previa vehicle, with registration number, LRG165AA, had lost control due to too much speeding. The Ogun State spokesperson of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Florence Okpe, said six women and two men were involved in the accident. “The injured victim was taken to Redeem Hospital for medical treatment, while the dead bodies were deposited at Idera Hospital morgue, Sagamu. “The suspected cause of the crash was excessive speed, which led to loss of control,” Okpe said. Meanwhile, the Ogun FRSC Sector Commander, Ahmed Umar, has described the crash as avoidable, urging motorists to avoid excessive speed and dangerous driving, especially on Lagos-Ibadan way, which is still being constructed. Umar sympathised with the victims of the incident and their families, even as he enjoined them to contact the FRSC Command in Mowe for details of the crash and to reclaim properties of the victims recovered from the crash scene.
