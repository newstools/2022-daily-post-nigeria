Traders in Akwa Ibom State have urged Governor Udom Emmanuel to fulfil his promise to release another tranche of loans to cushion the effect of their losses during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially those of them dealing with perishable items. It could be recalled that the governor had in the wake of the pandemic released N2 billion in interest-free loans to the first batch of traders under the cooperative societies and promised to release another tranche of loan for another batch which has remained unfulfilled. The traders, arising from a National Summit and Trade Exposition held at Itam Market, Uyo, the state capital, on Saturday reminded the governor that his promise was yet to be fulfilled. The Special Assistant to the governor on trade and market matters, Akparawa Idorenyin Raphael, who spoke on behalf of the traders at the event urged his principal to consider the traders’ request. He appealed for the creation of a desk office in all council areas, appoint supervisors on trade matters in each council and creation of the office of Senior Special Assistant to Governor on Trade and Market Matters to give room for the creation of three offices of Special Assistants to play a supervisory role in the three senatorial districts of the state. Also speaking, the keynote speaker, Elder Asuquo Jonah, who is the President of Akwa Ibom State Cooperative Federation called for the unbundling of the Bureau of Cooperative Development from the Ministry of Rural Development with increased funding in order for the ministry to cope with pressure and achieve effective supervision in the state. He further called for the involvement and formation of youth cooperative societies in the state as they have been seen forming various political support groups. “If the youths are better organized into cooperative economic development groups and be supported to channel their vibrant energies into cooperative businesses as they do in forming political support groups, it will not only increase the Gross Domestic Products (GDP) of the state, but will reduce the problem of unemployment successive governments face in the state,” Jonah said.
