Arsenal forward, Bukayo Saka, has named Barcelona’s Sergio Busquets as the toughest opponent he has faced since he broke out into the limelight. The 20-year-old made his senior debut for the Gunners in 2018 and has already made 122 appearances in all competitions for the club. However, Saka has only come up against Busquets once in his career, when Arsenal played Barcelona in a pre-season friendly in August 2019. The England youngster has now admitted he struggled to get near Busquets, who has won eight LaLiga titles and three Champions League trophies. When asked by GQ to name the player he’s been most impressed by during his career so far, Saka replied: “Sergio Busquets. “The way he just so elegantly turned me! I came at him to press him, I tried to fake this side then go to the other, and the way he just embarrassed me: I was just like, yeah, this guy is elite. “The way he just took me out of the play, I said, ‘Respect.’ [Busquets] is three steps ahead of everyone and that’s what makes you a top footballer. That’s what I realised that day.”
