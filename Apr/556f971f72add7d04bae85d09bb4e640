Manchester United interim boss, Ralf Rangnick has said that the Red Devils will not repeat rival, Liverpool’s 30-year spell without a league title. Man United, who have not won the Premier League since 2013 under l manage Sir Alex Ferguson, will face Liverpool on Tuesday night at Anfield. While Liverpool are chasing an unprecedented quadruple, Man United is only challenging to finish in the Premier League top four this season in a bid to qualify for next season’s UEFA Champions League. Speaking during his pre-match press conference ahead of Man United’s clash with Liverpool, Rangnick said: “There needs to be a rebuild for the future. “I suppose this [30 years without a title] will not happen because it is pretty obvious what needs to change.” He added, “If you know what you are looking for, it will take two or three windows. “It’s not complicated. It’s not rocket science. “Liverpool finished eighth in the season when Jurgen [Klopp] arrived. Then it took two transfer windows. They brought in the right players and got rid of the right players. That is why they are where they are.”
