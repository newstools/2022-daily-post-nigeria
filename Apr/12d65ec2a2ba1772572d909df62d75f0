Former England midfielder, Owen Hargreaves, has said that Manchester United need ‘surgery’ on and off the field this summer. According to the former Manchester United star, the club has to wait for a longer period before competing for major silverware again. Hargreaves pointed to ‘lack of strategy and plan’ as the real cause of United’s problem, adding that it has cost them dearly. Manchester United suffered a setback in their battle for a top four finish, drawing 1-1 with Leicester City at Old Trafford. Paul Pogba, Edinson Cavani, Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard will all leave on free transfers in the summer. They’re just four of 11 players that could depart, while the club need to appoint a new long-term manager. “I’m not surprised, they’ve been drifting for years,” Hargreaves told Premier League Productions. “They’ve been drifting since Sir Alex left. There’s a lack of strategy and plan. They’ve spent £1.2bn on this group of players and they’re not in a position where you can say there’s a blueprint there.
