Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has said that he benched Romelu Lukaku against Crystal Palace in Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final tie because the Belgium international lacks match fitness. Tuchel opted to start Timo Werner ahead of Lukaku as Chelsea defeated Crystal Palace 2-0 at Wembley Stadium. Two second-half goals from Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Mason Mount gave Chelsea the victory against Palace. Explaining why he did not start Lukaku, Tuchel said during his press conference: “He is not fit enough for the intensity of our game in an FA Cup semi-final. “It is not easy to come into a game such as this with so much riding on it after a spell out with injury. “It is just a case of him not having as much minutes recently as the other players, his match fitness is not quite there otherwise, there is a big chance that he would have started today.”
