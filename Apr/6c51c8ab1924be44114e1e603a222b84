The 2023 presidential aspirants under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, have met with the Akwa Ibom State governor, Mr Udom Emmanuel on how to bring out a consensus candidate for the party in the forthcoming elections. The delegation, who were in Akwa Ibom and would continue their consultation to Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, included the Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Mohammed; Sokoto State governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, the former President of the Senate, Abubakar Bukola Saraki and Alhaji Muhammad Hayatuddeen. Speaking on behalf of the delegation, the former Senate President, Dr. Saraki said they were in Akwa Ibom to brief the governor who is also one of the presidential aspirants of their plan to have a consensus arrangement, adding that that was what will make the party to come out stronger for the 2023 elections. According to him, “We’ve all agreed that where we are now in Nigeria, it has become very critical that we prepare well for 2023 and we can only do that when we are selfless, united and have a consensus arrangement. That’s why we are here.” Saraki expressed optimism that only the PDP could reverse the hardship and insecurity in Nigeria. Also speaking, the host, Mr Emmanuel, who welcomed the delegation to the State affirmed his support for the “One Nigeria” agenda and harped on the need to build a team of patriots to tackle the nation’s challenges on time. The Akwa Ibom State governor noted that the task of rescuing Nigeria was way beyond individualism and partisanship, rather it required a team that could take the bull by the horn and put the country in a right perspective. “This is the time we have to look inwards and reappraise, then look at certain things we must do and do it right, and timely. “That’s why you see these calibre of people coming together trying to find a consensus and to find a common ground to say that we are all but one,” the Governor said.
