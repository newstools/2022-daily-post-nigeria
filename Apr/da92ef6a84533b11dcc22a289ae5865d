The leadership of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ Ekiti State Council has waded into the matter between the management of Newcruse FM, Ikere Ekiti and its former General Manager, Mr Jide Ogunluyi. The management of Newcruse had recently issued a “Disclaimer” notice against the former GM on the pages of two national dailies where it alleged that Mr. Ogunluyi absconded from his duty as head of the station. In a statement in Ado Ekiti, NUJ Chairman, Comrade Rotimi Ojomoyela, explained that the union had met privately with both parties and made a passionate appeal for a stay of further action so as to enable the union investigate the matter. Ojomoyela explained that the issue had been immediately referred to the Ethics and Disciplinary Committee of the union for thorough investigation while the outcome of the committee would be made public very soon. According to the statement, a former chairman of the correspondents’ chapel, Mr. Yaqoub Popoola has been appointed to head the committee and has just one week to revert to the union. Ojomoyela appealed to the management of Newcruse to repose confidence in the abilities of the union to handle the matter and by such, suspend further action on the matter.
