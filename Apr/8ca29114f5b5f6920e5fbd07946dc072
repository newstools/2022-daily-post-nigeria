Former Manchester United midfielder, Paul Scholes, has claimed incoming manager Erik ten Hag will block Jesse Lingard from leaving the club this summer. Scholes feels Lingard might suit Ten Hag’s style of football. Lingard has made more than 200 appearances for United but is out of contract at the end of the current campaign. West Ham and Newcastle United have both been heavily linked with the forward, who is said to be unhappy at how he has been treated by Manchester United. Scholes, speaking on talkSPORT, said: “We all saw what he did at West Ham. He’s a really good footballer and can bring goals to a team. “I think he might suit him [Ten Hag] and he might want to keep him. We will see what happens. “It’s obvious he never wants to leave Manchester United, and if this manager wants him then why wouldn’t he stay?”
