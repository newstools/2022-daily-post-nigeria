Former Premier League striker, Dean Ashton has slammed Bruno Fernandes for stepping forward to take the penalty kick while Cristiano Ronaldo was on the pitch in Manchester United’s match against Arsenal on Saturday. Midfielder Granit Xhaka was the hero and Bruno Fernandes the villain as Arsenal beat the Red Devils 3-1 at the Emirates on Saturday. With the win, the Gunners took a huge stride toward finishing in the top four as they leapfrog Tottenham into fourth and create a 5-point gap with United. Xhaka’s late screamer sealed a priceless victory and compounded the Red Devils’ recent misery. Cristiano Ronaldo pulled one back for the visitors following an early opener from Nuno Tavares and a VAR-awarded penalty from Bukayo Saka. And many felt the Portugal star should have had the opportunity to equalise from the spot instead of Fernandes. With United trailing by one goal in the second half, Fernandes stepped up to take a penalty and hit the post. “You have to say: why is he taking it?” the ex-Premier League striker said. “Ronaldo is off the back of a hat-trick, he scored in the first-half, he’s full of confidence.” Ashton added at full-time: “You’ve got a confident record-breaking goalscorer on the pitch who has just scored and is playing well in the game, and Bruno wasn’t.”
