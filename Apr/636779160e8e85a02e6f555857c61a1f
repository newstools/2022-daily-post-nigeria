A meeting of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, members in Nsukka Local Government Area of Enugu State ended in a free-for-all on Saturday. DAILY POST learnt that all was going well in the meeting, which commenced around noon, until the arrival of Hon. Pat Asadu representing Nsukka/Igbo-Eze South in the House of Representatives. Asadu, a fourth term lawmaker, is seeking a return to the Green Chamber, a development that is attracting anger from the people of Nsukka Local Government Area. The lawmaker is from Igbo-Eze South Local Government Area and has remained in the seat for the past 16 years. Hon. Charles Ugwu, who last served from Nsukka Local Government Area, spent only one tenure of four years before Asadu took over and has remained there ever since. A source hinted that several other aspirants were earlier at the PDP meeting where they made their intentions known. According to the party source, “what we witnessed today in Nsukka Local Government Area is unprecedented. It is sad that thuggery has returned to our political system. “Every right thinking person should condemn it; politics must not be a do or die affair. As I speak to you, many people sustained various injuries in the mayhem.” He was, however, silent on who actually brought the thugs into the venue. It was gathered that in the ensuing melee, members, including women were seen in a trending video, scaling fence in order to escape from danger. DAILY POST made several attempts to reach Hon. Asadu but calls placed to his mobile number were not answered. When contacted, the Chairman of the PDP in Nsukka Local Government Area, Hon. Fabian Onah, who acknowledged that there was an incident, said, “I am in a meeting now, call me back tomorrow.”
