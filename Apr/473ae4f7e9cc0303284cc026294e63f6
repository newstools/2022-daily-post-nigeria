Former Manchester United star, Owen Hargreaves has hailed Super Eagles’ star, Kelechi Iheanacho after both clubs played out a 1-1 draw in the Premier League on Saturday. Kelechi Iheanacho headed in a brilliant cross from James Maddison to give Leicester City the lead after 62 minutes of the encounter. Hargreaves praised Kelechi for his fantastic goal, adding that the Foxes deserved to take the lead. Hargreaves told Premier League Productions, “He plays a lovely little ball into Maddison, hits it into that little pocket of space and it’s a fantastic header from Iheanacho. “And Leicester deserved that, they were the better team, they played really good stuff and United obviously didn’t have that attacking threat. “There was no Ronaldo, he was out with an illness, Bruno played as a false nine.” With the help of the video assistant referee, what would have been the winner from Maddison was disallowed after Fred equalised for the home side in the 66th minute.
