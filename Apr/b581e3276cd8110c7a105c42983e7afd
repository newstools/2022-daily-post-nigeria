Kidnappers have reportedly killed a popular Kano-based businessman, Alhaji Umar Sani, on Saturday, after payment of ransom. DAILYPOST recalls that Alhaji Sani was kidnapped along Kaduna-Birnin Gwari road some days ago. His abductors had contacted his family and demanded ransom, which was paid a few days ago. A family source told DAILY POST in Kaduna on Saturday, that “the businessman, also called Magaji, was abducted two weeks ago alongside five others on the highway en route to Buruku, but was later confirmed killed by his co-abductees few days despite collecting ransom for their release.” According to him, the deceased hailed from Fagge Local Government Area in Kano metropolis. Also, an elder brother of the deceased, Hussaini Sani, who confirmed the death, said the kidnappers had called back on Thursday, demanding another N20million from them despite killing the businessman. According to him, nine of them were kidnapped along the Kaduna-Birnin Gwari road while on their way to Buruku. They later released three of them but withheld six. He said after some time, negotiation started with the families of the six people, “and we later agreed to pay them collectively, only for us to see five of them coming back.’’ “When we asked them about the whereabouts of our brother, they confirmed to us that he was killed by the abductors. We called them (abductors) using the number they used for the negotiation and they insisted that our brother was still alive, and even went ahead to demand another ransom before they would release him,” he said.
