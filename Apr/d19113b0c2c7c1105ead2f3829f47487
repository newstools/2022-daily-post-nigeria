Former England international, Joe Cole, has the positions Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur will finish this season on the Premier League table. Chelsea are currently in the third position in the Premier League ahead of fourth-place Tottenham, Arsenal (5th) and Man United (7th) on the log. But Cole believes Chelsea will secure the third position ahead of Arsenal, Tottenham and Man United. According to him, Arsenal will eventually finish in the fourth position on the Premier League table, while Tottenham and Manchester United will finish outside the top four. Speaking about the teams to finish top-four between Chelsea, Arsenal, Man United and Tottenham, Cole told JOE: “Chelsea will do it [finish third]. I can see Arsenal finishing fourth too. I think it will be Chelsea and Arsenal in those last two positions [third and fourth]. “Having the points on the board is massive. I covered Arsenal’s win at Aston Villa [before the international break] and it was one of those where Arsenal might have got beat in the last few years. “I know they slipped up against Crystal Palace but I just think Arsenal will have enough, what Mikel Arteta has done there has been brilliant. I think Chelsea will finish third and Arsenal should come fourth.”
