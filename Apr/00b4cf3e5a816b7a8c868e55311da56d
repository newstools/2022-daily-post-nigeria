The Zamfara State Government has officially dethroned the three suspended traditional leaders accused of involvement in banditry activities in the state. It said that the decision was taken after the committees submitted their reports to the government. This was disclosed by the state’s Commissioner of Information, Hon. Ibrahim Magaji Dosara and his counterpart, the state Commissioner of Security and Internal Affairs, Hon Mammam Tsafe, immediately after the State’s Executive Council meeting at the Government House in Gusau. According to commissioners, the government also approved the revocation of lands allocated to non-indigines of Zamfara State, saying that the lands were being occupied illegally by the occupants without going through due process. They further explained that the state government has also approved the immediate dethronement of the three traditional leaders accused of involvement in banditry activities. “We took the decision after careful examination of the reports submitted by the two committees to the State government,” they said. Recall that in June 2021, the three traditional leaders were accused of involvement in banditry activities by the state government, which led to their suspension and detention. DAILY POST reports that the three traditional leaders have been in the custody of the state government.
