Manchester United legend, Gary Neville has accused the club’s manager, Ralf Rangnick of killing Marcus Rashford’s career with his team selection against Leicester City on Saturday. Despite Cristiano Ronaldo missing Man United’s Premier League tie against Leicester through illness, Rashford was only named on the Red Devils’ bench as Bruno Fernandes played a false nine. And Neville was surprised by Rashford’s omission and said Rangnick’s decision would have ‘killed’ the England international. Asked about Rashford’s omission after Man United played 1-1 with Leicester at Old Trafford, Neville told Sky Sports: “I was struggling a little bit with it before the game without the centre forward. “That is killed Marcus Rashford today, not playing in that team. “I know he’s been poor, I know he’s lacked confidence, but for Cristiano Ronaldo to pull out this morning and for Paul Pogba to go in and change the system of play and the way in which the game has been approached and not just put Marcus Rashford in as a striker as a straight swap having trained with the players the last ten days. “Overall, there is too many things at this club that are uncertain.”
