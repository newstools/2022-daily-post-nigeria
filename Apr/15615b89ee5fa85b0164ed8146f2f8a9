Former Chelsea winger, Paul Canoville, has paid tribute to defender Andreas Christensen ahead of his potential move to Barcelona in the summer. Canoville wished Christensen well at Barcelona, adding that Levi Colwill will be his replacement at Chelsea. Christensen’s contract with Chelsea will expire at the end of the season and the West London club cannot renew the contracts of their current players due to the UK sanctions imposed on their owner Roman Abramovich following Russia’s Ukraine invasion. Reports had emerged that Christensen had decided to join Barcelona at the end of the season. Christensen joined Chelsea from Brøndby IF in 2012/2013. “Andreas has been superb for our club Chelsea since coming from the academy and learning [his] trade on loan. [A] European and world champion. Wish him well with Barcelona. Levi Colwill is going to be by far the better player!,” said Cannoville on Twitter. Colwill is currently on loan at Championship club Huddersfield Town. The 19-year-old has made 26 appearances for Huddersfield across competitions and has helped them climb to fourth place in the Championship table.
