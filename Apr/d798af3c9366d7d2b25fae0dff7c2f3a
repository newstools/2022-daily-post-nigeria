Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has said Kevin De Bruyne and Kyle Walker are doubts to face Liverpool in their FA Cup semi-final on Saturday. Both players were absent from training on Friday. Guardiola has now admitted both players will be assessed ahead of the trip to Wembley. De Bruyne and Walker picked up the knocks during their goalless draw at Atletico Madrid in the Champions League on Wednesday. Speaking in his pre-match press conference, Guardiola said: “We will see tomorrow about De Bruyne and Walker. “Ruben Dias trained today and we will see about him. “Kyle would have remained on the pitch. He had a big twist but it is getting better. In football, these kinds of things happen but we will adapt and adjust. “Kevin has stitches in his calf. It is not a muscular injury.”
