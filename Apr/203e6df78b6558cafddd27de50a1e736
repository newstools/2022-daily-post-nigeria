Former Kano Governor Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso has said he controls votes and has what it takes ahead of the 2023 election. Kwankwaso made this known while speaking with Chude Jideonwo. According to the ex-governor, he worked for President Muhammadu Buhari after he was convinced not because of his tribe or money. Kwankwaso urged presidential aspirants to come to him adding that the presidency is not an appointment but by who is capable. The former Governor said, “My former colleagues in government met in Lagos and said the presidency has to go to them, how? Come and talk to me, we control votes, it is not an appointment. “Convince me, other people convinced me from that side, at least from Abiola’s days till this moment, people will come. “Even Buhari convinced me at that particular time and I worked for him not because he had money or anything or because he is the only Hausa, Fulani, Yoruba or anything and that’s exactly what it is, and that’s exactly what we are doing. “Every day we are working round the clock to convince our friends across the country that this is where we are, this is what we have done, this is what we are to do this is the capacity we have and it’s based on that, not because I am a Muslim or I am a Christian or I am Hausa or I am Yoruba. “No! And you see, in 2023, eyes don open.” Kwankwaso defected from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP to the New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP. He has a strong fan base in the North as well as a number of Southern states. The former Minister of Defence and Kano Central Senator (2015 – 2019) is the leader of the Kwankwasiyya movement which has around 2 million members across Nigeria. He mentioned that he may be considering launching a second force ahead of the 2023 election in order to be where he’ll be taken seriously. &n   A post shared by Chude Jideonwo (@chudeity) bsp;
