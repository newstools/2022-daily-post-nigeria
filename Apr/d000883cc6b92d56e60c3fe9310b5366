The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Monday, reacted to claims that President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered the release of its leader, Nnamdi Kanu. There were reports that Buhari ordered the release of the IPOB leader from detention. Kanu has been incarcerated since 2021 June, when he was arrested in Kenya and repatriated to Nigeria. The IPOB leader was arraigned before Justice Binta Nyako-led Federal High Court sitting in Abuja upon return to Nigeria. The IPOB leader was arraigned on charges bordering on terrorism. But, reports surfaced online that the President ordered the release of the IPOB leader. However, IPOB’s spokesman, Emma Powerful, dismissed such reports. In a chat with DAILY POST, Powerful said: “That is April fool and IPOB will not be moved by mere talk without action, IPOB is bigger than that.”
