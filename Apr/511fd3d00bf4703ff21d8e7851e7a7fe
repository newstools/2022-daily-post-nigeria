A civic initiative in Osun State has called on the state government to introduce a system that will bring all stakeholders together to solve the Osun river crisis. Recall that Osun State Government on Wednesday declared a full-blown war on illegal mining activities in the state. The Osun State government called on the Mineral Resources and Environmental Management Committee (MIREMCO), created to resolve issues surrounding mining activities in the state and NESREA – for a joint task force to apprehend those found wanting in line with global best standards in mining. The civic initiative, Urban Alert, had raised an alarm earlier this year in its press release tagged #SaveOsunRiver that the river is heavily contaminated with mercury, lead, cyanide and other injurious elements that are poisonous to human health. The group blamed the harmful contamination of the river on the activities of gold mining which it said has put the lives of over 2 million residents of Osun State in danger. A statement signed by the Communications Officer of Urban Alert, Oluwatosin Olarewaju said ending the menace of illegal and unregulated gold mining activities and its impacts on the lives of the people, water bodies, and the Osun-Osogbo Sacred Grove (UNESCO World Heritage Site) demands a sincere approach by the government and all stakeholders. Harping on the government approach to end the menace, Urban Alert said the problem needs an independent assessment of the current situation, remediation and enforcement of policies that protect the environment, mining communities and the water bodies. “There is an urgent need for an independent assessment of the current situation, remediation and enforcement of policies that protect the environment, mining communities and the water bodies. “We urge the Osun State Government to initiate a holistic approach that will awaken the Federal Government to save the ecosystem and bring all stakeholders together to solve this problem,” the group said.
