Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, an All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain, has slammed Chris Ngige, Minister of Labour and Employment, and Rotimi Amaechi, Minister of Transportation, for remaining in office despite declaring their interest in the 2023 presidential election. He said Amaechi and Ngige should have resigned from office in accordance with Section 84 of the new Electoral Act, describing it as an “ethical failure”. The former presidential candidate of the Trust Party in 2019 said this in Abuja on Tuesday. Olawepo-Hashim, himself an APC presidential aspirant, added that Nigeria needs a government of national unity and stimulation of devolution of power. He maintained that at this point in the nation’s history, nobody can be a superstar, saying all interests have to be aggregated into one. “We need to include everyone, not to exclude anybody. The country is really divided along ethnic and religious lines, it is very difficult for any party to even produce a candidate right now that can win in more than four zones out of the six zones of the country because of the division in the country,” he said.
