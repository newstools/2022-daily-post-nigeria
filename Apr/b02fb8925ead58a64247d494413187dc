Russia has made an honest confession about its troops in Ukraine, amid the ongoing war between both neighbouring countries. Speaking on Thursday, Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, briefly admitted that Russia had suffered “significant” losses of its troops in Ukraine. Peskov described the losses as “a huge tragedy” for the Russian people. When asked whether the withdrawal of Russian troops from Kyiv and its region could be seen as “a humiliation” for the Kremlin, Peskov told Sky News: “Using those words would be a wrong understanding of the situation.” “We have significant losses of troops and it is a huge tragedy for us,” he admitted. Peskov also claimed that the reason for Russia’s withdrawal from the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions of Ukraine was “an act of goodwill during the negotiations between the Ukrainian and Russian delegations.” He added that Russia did so to “lift tension from those regions in order to show Russia is really ready to create comfortable conditions for the continuation of the negotiations.” The war between Russia and Ukraine began in February this year and many casualties have already been recorded.
