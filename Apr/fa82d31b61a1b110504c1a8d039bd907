Following incessant attacks on its personnel, which recently led to the death of two staff, while others sustained varying degrees of injuries, the Bauchi State Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has resolved to seek divine intervention. The State Corps Commander, Yusuf Abdullahi, made this known during a visit to orphanage homes in the State capital. He requested the children and their care-givers to pray for the operatives. According to Abdullahi, they were using the opportunity of the Holy month of Ramadan to seek prayers for the protection and safety of the operatives, to enable them carryout their mandate successfully. The sector commander, however, assured that despite the experiences of the personnel in the hands of hoodlums, which put their lives at high risks, the Corps would not relent in its efforts aimed at ensuring accident-free roads across Bauchi State. Abdullahi said the primary objective of the FRSC was to minimise road crashes by enforcing strict adherence to traffic rules and regulations by all roads users. He solicited support and cooperation of the people of the State in that regard.
