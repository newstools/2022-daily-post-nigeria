Muslims in Taraba State and the country at large have been urged to pray for peace to reign in the country which has been bedevilled by the insecurity of life and property. The speaker of the Taraba State House of Assembly, Joseph Albasu Kunini, made the admonition on Saturday in Jalingo, the state capital, while felicitating the Muslims on the commencement of this year’s Ramadan fast. According to him, since the holy month of Ramadan “is meant to strengthen the relationship between the Muslim Ummah and their Creator,” they should use the opportunity to pray for His intervention for peace to permeate every part of the country. “This has become imperative because we are approaching the electioneering period and people have started jostling for various elective offices, hence only fervent prayers will ensure the emergence of good leaders both at the state and federal levels,” he said. Praying that “this year’s Ramadan mark the turning point in the precarious situation in the country” he urged both Muslims and Christians not to relent on praying for peace to reign in the state and the nation at large.
