Niger State House of Assembly lawmakers have screened and confirmed three commissioner nominees that include two former Commissioners forwarded by the state Governor, Alh Abubakar Sani Bello. The two past state Commissioners are Hon. Yusuf Muhammad Gunu who had manned at least three state ministries under the administration of former Governor Mu’azu Babangida Aliyu and Honorable Abbas Kabiru Musa who headed various ministries in Governor Abubakar Sani Bello’s first tenure. The third nominee, Honorable Musa Emmanuel Umaru, a first-time nominee was screened and confirmed. During the house sitting on Thursday, each nominee was called upon, one after the other and asked to take a bow and leave. However, except Hon. Yusuf Muhammad Gunu was asked a few questions by Hon. Malik Madaki Bosso, representing Bosso Constituency. Bosso had insisted that the commissioner nominee must answer two questions from him. Shortly, after the screening, the nominees in their separate remarks told journalists that despite time constraints, security challenges and paucity of funds, they will do their best to contribute to the development of the state within the shortest time they have to stay in office.
