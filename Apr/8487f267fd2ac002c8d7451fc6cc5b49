Nigerian singer, Tolulope Ajayi, better known as T-Classic has disclosed how he got saved from depression. T-Classic had in a recent Instagram live mentioned that he was depressed a while ago before the release of ‘Makaveli’, after a fan called him an upcoming singer. Speaking on HipTv on Saturday, the singer said he fell into depression but was saved by Peter Okoye of Psquare, Nollywood actress Omotola Jalade-Ekeinde, Real Warri Pikin (Anita Asuoha’ (Comedian) who spoke to him and offered help. He said, “I was depressed before I released my single ‘Makaveli’ but thank God I was saved by Mr P (Peter Okoye), Omotola and Real Warri Pikin. “It was a tough time in my life.” He also lamented about cliques in the Nigerian music industry which makes it hard to collaborate with some artists. He also went ahead to reveal that he spent some nights at a top artist in Nigeria’s house just to collaborate but still couldn’t get it. “It’s been hard to collaborate, but I don’t blame the big artists because they are usually busy and have shows, other events to attend,” T-Classic said.
