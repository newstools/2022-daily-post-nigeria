The Commissioner for Security and Home Affairs, Zamfara State, Ibrahim Mamman Tsafe’s son has been shot dead by suspected bandits. The commissioner’s son and three others were killed when Tsafe town was invaded by gunmen on Sunday night. DAILY POST recalls that Tsafe town and other communities in Tsafe Local Government Area have witnessed attacks, killings and kidnapping for ransom. A resident and a customs officer were killed in separate attacks on the town two months ago. The armed men, in February, shot dead a muezzin while he was calling for subhi prayer in Magazu, a community about 5km South of Tsafe town. A source told DAILY POST that the bandits, who are believed to be fleeing military operations in some parts of the State, are gradually turning parts of Tsafe Local Government into their new area of operation. The source further explained that the terrorists in military uniform invaded Shiyar Namada area, close to the commissioner’s residence and opened fire on people. He said, “Some residents who had earlier spotted them mistook them as security operatives on routine patrol. Some of them didn’t bother to raise alarm.” He narrated that the commissioner’s son and some other people were seated at the frontage of DIG Ibrahim Mamman Tsafe’s residence during iftar when suddenly the armed men showed up and started firing at everyone on sight. He stated that during the attack, most people observing Tarawih prayer in several mosques around the area and other residents, had to flee to safety, stressing that the armed men later withdrew into the forest. He added that he is at the Waziri’s residence where preparation for the burial of the victims was underway. SP Muhammad Shehu, the Spokesman of the State Police Command could not be reached for comment as of the time of filing this report.
