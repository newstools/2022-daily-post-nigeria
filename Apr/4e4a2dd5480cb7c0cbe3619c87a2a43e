All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain, Dakuku Peterside has hailed Transportation Minister, Rotimi Amaechi for declaring his intention to contest the 2023 presidency. The former Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) Director General said Amaechi answered Nigerians’ calls to run. In a statement on Sunday, Peterside described the former Rivers Governor as “most fitting, competent, and pan-Nigerian”. “I commend Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi for taking this critical decision to serve Nigerians in the highest office in the land. “Heeding the call of Nigerians to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari is a call to continuation of the current Administration’s determination to develop the nation”, he said. Peterside noted that the APC looks unstoppable in its goal of winning the presidential, governorship and other elective positions in Rivers next year. On the Rivers governorship race, he said the party was on the right path of recovery and victory. The former DG said the people were tired of the “sad breast-pocket governance style of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state”. He added that the successes recorded during the ward, local and state congresses had reinvigorated membership in readiness to kick-out the PDP. “Our people have suffered enough in the hands of Wike and PDP but APC is set to end all of that and reset the state to achieving her full potential. “That PDP must go in 2023 is our resolve, and working in harmony, we shall achieve that.” Peterside said the Port-Harcourt gathering on Saturday was an attestation of APC’s resolve to terminate “the directionless regime of Wike and his PDP”.
