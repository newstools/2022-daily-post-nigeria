Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has called on Nigerians to pray for the nation and the Gateway State. Abiodun, in his Easter message, said the sacrifice made by Christ through his death and resurrection is an “assurance that there is hope that the country will surmount its present challenges.” While felicitating Christian faithful, Abiodun, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, called on the people to have sober reflections, particularly, at this moment the nation is facing insecurity and economic downturn. The governor, who enjoined them to celebrate moderately, also urged them to be their brothers’ keepers; noting the essence of the celebration is to show love and good neighbourliness. Abiodun assured that his administration will continue to work to ensure the state is safe and attractive to investors. Likewise, the Akinruyiwa of Owu Kingdom in Abeokuta, Chief Olumide Aderinokun, urged Nigerians, Ogun residents and the people of Ogun Central Senatorial District not to lose hope. Aderinokun, in his Easter message made available to DAILY POST, emphasised his belief in a better Nigeria, saying Nigeria will not fall. The Ogun Central Senatorial District aspirant pleaded with the people to embrace unity, regardless of their ethnic or religious beliefs. “This is another time of reflection for Christians but I bring this message of hope, recovery and of rebirth to everyone. “I believe in a better Nigeria and one of the lessons the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ signifies is that we can rise from any challenges we are currently facing as a country. “We only need to be united and strong as we walk this road together, as we struggle to turn around the fortunes of our great country, Nigeria for the better,” he said. The Owu chief prayed for God’s blessings while wishing the people happy celebrations.
