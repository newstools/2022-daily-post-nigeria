Former England striker Darren Bent has slammed Manchester United and Tottenham for being inconsistent, a situation that has allowed Arsenal to still be in contention for top-four finish this season. Bent noted that the only reason Arsenal are still hopeful of qualifying for Champions League next season was because Manchester United had Tottenham have shown inconsistency week in week out. Arsenal and Tottenham both lost their matches on Saturday to Brighton and Southampton respectively. Few weeks ago, Arsenal were tipped to grab the Champions League final spot following an impressive run of results, having started the season poorly. But they have lost three straight matches and are now sixth in the table with just three points separating the Gunners, Manchester United and Tottenham. “You can’t rule Arsenal out because as we’ve seen, the teams around them are inconsistent. Spurs are inconsistent, so are United,” Bent told Premier League Productions. “Arsenal have still got the opportunity but they need to find some consistent form from somewhere. You can’t be losing three games in a row. “After that run they shouldn’t really be anywhere near it but the fact is they are because the race for the top-four has been so poor. “We’ve seen that Tottenham are capable of going on a run and I expect them to do that. It’s still in Spurs’ hands because Arsenal and United are so inconsistent.”
