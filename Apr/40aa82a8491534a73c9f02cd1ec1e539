Dele Momodu, a Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential aspirant, on Thursday dismissed claims that he is “fronting for a politician.” Momodu said it’s insulting for Nigerians to insinuate that he is fronting for a politician. In a post on his verified Facebook, the media mogul stressed that most of the current political gladiators are not his senior. According to Momodu: “None of the current political gladiators can claim to be my senior or superior in global networks. “I always feel insulted when some people say “you’re fronting for a politician”. NOT ME, I have paid and earned my dues. I have been a humble political player in the last four decades and none of the current political gladiators can claim to be my senior or superior in global networks.” The Publisher of Ovation Magazine recently declared his intentions to run for the presidency. Momodu had recently said his fellow presidential aspirant, Atiku Abubakar, will support his ambition. The media mogul explained that he looks forward to Atiku’s massive support for his presidential ambition in 2023.
