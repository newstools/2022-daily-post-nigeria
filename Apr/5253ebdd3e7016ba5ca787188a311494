Former Manchester United, Real Madrid and Liverpool striker, Michael Owen has issued a strong top-four warning to Chelsea. Owen warned that looking at the Premier League table, Arsenal may catch up with Thomas Tuchel’s side with Tottenham also on their trail. The former England striker warned the Blues’ top-four finish is not guaranteed Antonio Rudiger put the European Champions ahead with a superb effort from long-range in the first half. But Brentford equalised through Vitaly Janelt and Christian Eriksen added the second before Janelt added a third for Brentford. Despite the loss, Chelsea remain third in the Premier League table but have failed to extend their five-point lead over Arsenal, who have a game in hand. Tottenham and Manchester United, who are in fifth place, still have the chance to overtake Chelsea with nine games remaining. Owen told Premier League productions: “Who would have believed that?”
