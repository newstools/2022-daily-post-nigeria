Former interim head coach of the Super Eagles, Augustine Eguavoen has said that he wants to manage the national team again despite his failure to qualify Nigeria for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Recall that Eguavoen resigned after failing to qualify Nigeria for the 2022 World Cup. Nigeria failed to qualify for this year’s World Cup after losing to the Black Stars of Ghana by an away goal last month. Nigeria and Ghana teams played 1-1 in the second leg playoff at the MKO Abiola Stadium in Abuja. Both West African giants had played a 0-0 draw in the first leg in Kumasi. Speaking during SuperSports’ program, Monday Night Football, Eguavoen said he would take the opportunity to coach the Super Eagles again if he is called upon in the near future. “If there is still an opportunity for me, I will want to coach the Eagles again, but not at this moment, maybe later,” Eguavoen said. “If I am called upon to lead the team again, I will definitely take up the job. I am still one of the good coaches in the country. I can still prove a point, it is just a matter of time. “No regrets taking up the job. When you are called to serve the nation, I could not refuse them,” he added.
