Former presidential aide, Reno Omokri has revealed that the 2022 Grammy Award winner, Angelique Kidjo is Nigerian, saying she speaks the Yoruba language fluently. Recall that Nigerian singer, Wizkid’s Made in Lagos, which was nominated for Best Global Music Album, lost to Angelique Kidjo’s Mother Nature. Omokri said Section 25 of Nigeria’s Constitution qualifies the Beninese singer-songwriter to be a citizen of the country. He lambasted Nigerians who were bashing Angelique Kidjo on social media for defeating Nigerian artists in the just concluded 64th Annual Grammy Awards. Reno tackled Nigerians for giving attention to the outcome of the Grammy Awards at the expense of the security crisis bedevilling the nation. He said, “When I saw how Nigerians were more concerned with the Grammy Awards, and especially with bashing Angelique Kidjo (who is actually qualified to be a Nigerian citizen) than the widespread killings by terrorists in our country, I realised that Buhari is not the only problem Nigeria has! “Let me shock some of you-Angelique Kidjo speaks fluent Yoruba. By virtue of Section 25 of Nigeria’s Constitution, Angelique Kidjo is a Nigerian. It shows the depth of ignorance of Nigerians to attack her for defeating Nigeria at the Grammy. Can Nigeria defeat Nigeria”?
