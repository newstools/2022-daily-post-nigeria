The planned arraignment of the emir of Dansadau and Zurmi, Alh. Hussaini Umar and Alh Abubakar Atiku, respectively, who were dethroned by Zamfara State Governor, Hon. Bello Mohammed Matawalle over alleged banditry activities has been stalled. DAILY POST reports that there was a mild drama during the arraignment as the presiding Magistrate was not in the court, which made the counsels to the plaintiff and that of the defendants to agree on adjournment. Addressing newsmen at the premises of the court, counsel to the defendants, Barrister Ahmad Kwatarkwashi said the government was not able to arraign the two emirs for obvious security reasons. “The two emirs were suspended and have been in the State Government custody for several months without trial,” he said. It was, however, gathered that some human rights activists mounted pressure on the Zamfara State government to stop the prolonged detention of the monarchs and arraign them before a court of competent jurisdiction. DAILY POST, however, reports that there has been no official statement either from the government or the security agencies as regards the arraignment. Recalled that Zamfara State Government had accused some traditional leaders of collaboration with bandits ravaging the State. The embattled emirs are currently in government custody, pending their arraignment to face the charges against them.
