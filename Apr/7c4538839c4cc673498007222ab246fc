Tyson Fury on Saturday night, knocked out Dillian Whyte in the sixth round to retain his WBC heavyweight title. The fight was staged in front of 94,000 fans at the Wembley Stadium. Fury sent Whyte to the canvas with a stunning uppercut, barely a second to go in the sixth round. Although Whyte staggered to his feet, he had been seriously dazed and the referee rightly ended proceedings. The undefeated Fury has been linked with an undisputed world title fight against the winner of Anthony Joshua’s rematch with Oleksandr Usyk. But the 33-year-old has suggested this could be his last bout. Fury told BT Sport: “I think this is it. “It might be the final curtain for The Gypsy King and what a way to go out.”
