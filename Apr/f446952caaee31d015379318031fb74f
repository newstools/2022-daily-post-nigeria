May the Almighty guide us and our security operatives with the wisdom to overcome our societal challenges. “This is also a Ramadan of hope in the sense that the world is resurrecting after the pandemic shutdown. “Operations under Hajj and Umrah industry are normalizing starting with restoration of Umrah at full capacity in the Makkah Grand Mosque and Madinah’s Prophet’s Mosque. This gives us in the Hajj Commission of Nigeria immense pleasure. “Therefore, the Commission has made adequate arrangements to monitor the Umrah in order to protect the interest of the muntamireen from Nigeria (Umrah pilgrims). “We hence call on all Umrah pilgrims and respectable Licensed Tour Operators to document their agreements and contracts for necessary arbitration in case of contract violation. On behalf of the Commission, I wish all our muntamireen a successful Ramadan Umrah pilgrimage. “As we look forward to a successful Hajj season in 2022, it is my prayer that Allah, (to Whom belongs the most beautiful names) make Hajj 2022 a reality for all Nigerian Muslims who yearn to participate in this year’s exercise. “This will come true, by Allah’s grace if Nigeria is allocated an expanded quota for her pilgrims. May He, who destines events, fulfil the desires of intending pilgrims, from all over the world, to be part of those who will worship Him in a peaceful and gratifying manner on mount Arafat this year.
