It was a black Easter Sunday in Orlu Local Government Area of Imo State as unknown gunmen reportedly went on a rampage in some locations, killing one person and injuring several people. DAILY POST gathered that the shooting started from Banana junction and then extended to the popular Nkwu-Ito Junction and its environs. Vehicular movements were restricted while vehicles and other property were reportedly affected as the unknown gunmen shot sporadically before the security operatives challenged them. A community source told our correspondent that the bandits alleged to be Eastern Security Network (ESN) members came out to challenge the Ebubeagu Security Outfit as the latter was said to have arrived in Orlu last Saturday. He said their presence infuriated the gunmen who allegedly came out to challenge them today. The source further said that a life was lost in the attack, adding that the incident which occurred at about 12:30 pm, forced residents to take cover in their various houses as motorists completely avoided the Orlu main town. According to him, the gunmen allegedly shot at the tires of a vehicle belonging to the Nigerian Army near the Judiciary High Court Orlu. Ukwu Aki is a popular brothel in Amaifeke Orlu. The popular Inland Guest House Orlu was set ablaze by security operatives while trying to restore normalcy in the area. One Emeka Uba explained that trouble started when the unknown gunmen in their numbers were moving to some places within the area. Uba also told DAILY POST that, “one person in front of a Lexus saloon car was shot dead and his car destroyed.” DAILY POST gathered that passengers heading to Orlu from Owerri Akwakuma Fly Over to be precise were all stranded as they waited for hours.
