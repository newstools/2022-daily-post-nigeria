Manchester City, legend Sergio Aguero, has hit out at manager Pep Guardiola for scolding winger Riyad Mahrez during their UEFA Champions League semi-final 4-3 victory against Real Madrid on Tuesday night. Guardiola’s men defeated Real Madrid at the Etihad, thanks to goals from Kevin de Bruyne, Gabriel Jesus, Foden and Bernardo Silva, as Karim Benzema and Vinicius’ goals were not enough for the visitors. However, during the encounter, Mahrez went close to doing further damage and having Manchester City in the promising position of being 3-0 up. The Algerian international paced forward following questionable defending from Real Madrid, cut inside but could only lash his strike against the side netting. Phil Foden was waiting in the box as well and Mahrez could have passed it to him. Hence, Guardiola reacted angrily, scolding the former Leicester City star for his miss. But Aguero came out in defense of Mahrez at the same time as lamenting Guardiola for his angry reaction. Aguero was streaming the game on Twitch with former Man City teammate Mario Balotelli when he said: “I don’t like Pep getting angry like that. “He scolded Riyad. I hope he scores a goal.” He then went on to share his own experience dealing with Guardiola’s rage, saying: “Once against Tottenham, I got angry with Pep and we yelled in each other’s faces.”
