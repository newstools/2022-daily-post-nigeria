A 23-year-old man, Ikenna James, has been arrested by the police for allegedly raping and killing his 29-year-old neighbour, Oluwatosin Adefisayo, who the police said was a graduate of Obafemi Awolowo University. DAILY POST gathered that the incident occurred at Ogijo, Sagamu Local Government Area of the state. The State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said on Thursday that the suspect lived within the same compound as the woman. He was said to have connived with his friend, who is now at large, to break into the apartment of the victim at night, through the ceiling. As the woman was fast asleep, the duo reportedly “raped her before they strangled her.” According to Oyeyemi, other neighbours including the parents of the suspect woke up in the morning only to discover that the apartment of the deceased had been broken into. The neighbours had invited the local vigilante to the scene, where they saw Ikenna coming down from the ceiling, where he had been hiding after the act. The state police spokesman said the suspect was held down while a distress call was made to the police at Ogijo divisional headquarters; adding that the DPO, CSP Onatufeh Umoh, led his men to the scene and got the suspect arrested. During interrogation, Oyeyemi said the suspect confesses to the police that they had decided to kill the victim after raping her because she was able to recognise them. He explained that Ikenna’s parents described his arrest as good radiance to bad rubbish, saying they have already given up on him as the black sheep of the family. He added that the parents also appealed to authorities concerned to ensure that appropriate punishment is awarded to him. Meanwhile, the state Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, has ordered the immediate transfer of the suspect to the Homicide Section of the State CIID for further investigation, while also directing that his accomplice be hunted for and brought to book.
