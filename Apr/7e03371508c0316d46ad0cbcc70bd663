The Association of Licensed Telecommunication Operators of Nigeria (ALTON) has complied with the Federal Government’s order to block certain lines. ALTON says subscribers affected are those yet to link their National Identification Number (NIN) with their SIM. The Chairman, Gbenga Adebayo, and Head of Operations, Gbolahan Awonuga, made an announcement on Tuesday via a statement. They confirmed that operators received a formal directive from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). The body said lines that are not in compliance with the NIN-SIM Linkage Policy requirement would remain shut out. The policy requires that all Subscriber Identification Modules (SIMs) must be linked with a NIN. “Our members are committed to complying with the instructions and call on telecommunication subscribers who have not obtained or linked their NIN to their SIMs, to do so at any of the designated centres”, the statement reads. ALTON added that operators remained committed to supporting the Federal Government and upholding the rights of citizens to communicate.
