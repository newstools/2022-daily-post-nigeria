The Police in Rivers State have apprehended Promise Dogoh, a 23-year-old native of Kamnor community in Khana Local Government Area. Public Relations Officer, DSP Grace Iringe-Koko announced his arrest in a statement on Tuesday. Promise “specialized” in swapping cards at several ATM points in the state and steal money from bank accounts. The suspect’s luck expired when he swapped the card of another victim and withdrew N640,000, the entire money in the account. The citizen reported the matter to the police who promptly swung into action and arrested the culprit. “Promise is currently helping in the investigation and shall soon appear in court”, the statement noted. Commissioner of Police, Eboka Friday advised people to be wary of strangers at ATM galleries and desist from seeking assistance from them. “They should rather approach staffers of the banks who can easily be identified should anything go wrong”, CP Friday said.
