No fewer than 22 suspected cultists have been arrested by the Special Operation Squad set up by the Ogun State police command following the recent cult clashes that claimed about 16 lives in Abeokuta, Sagamu and Ilaro areas of the State. After an order from President Muhammadu Buhari that cultists should be suppressed in Ogun, the police had created a special squad to checkmate their activities across the state. On Monday, the Ogun State police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, disclosed that “the Squad has swung into action and arrested no fewer than 22 cultists in different parts of the State.” According to Oyeyemi, “the arrested cultists have affirmed their membership of Aye and Eiye confraternities.” He said they were apprehended when the Squad stormed their hideouts at Mayas in Lafenwa in Abeokuta North and Oju Ogbara in Sapon Area of Abeokuta South Local Government. The police image maker added that some of the suspects were also nabbed in Sagamu. He explained that “all the arrested suspects are being investigated to ascertain their roles in the cult war which claimed the lives of some cult members” recently in the state. Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, has urged the squad to take the battle to the doorsteps of all known cultists in the state, appealing to residents to give the police necessary information that would enhance their operations.
