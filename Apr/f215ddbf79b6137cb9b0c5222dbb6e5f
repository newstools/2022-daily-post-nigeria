Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp has suggested that Sadio Mane may have to win the Champions League if he stands any chance of winning the 2022 Ballon d’ Or because he is not Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo. Klopp said this after Mane helped Liverpool to beat Villarreal 2-0 in the Champions League semi-final first-leg tie on Wednesday night at Anfield. Mane has been on fire for Liverpool in recent weeks as Liverpool are still in the race to win an unprecedented quadruple and his form in recent weeks has made a difference. Asked about Mane’s chances of winning the Ballon d’Or this year, Klopp claimed that it was too early to say. The German, however, praised the Senegalese for his brilliance this season, but added that he does not completely understand Ballon d’Or nominations. “Mane has had an outstanding season and is an outstanding player. I have nothing to do with the Ballon d’Or nominations. I don’t understand it 100%,” Klopp said, as quoted by The Liverpool Echo. “He is world-class. He again played a really good game for us, but I don’t know how I can answer with the season not even over.” He added, “Historically, we have to win something to win the Ballon d’Or. Most of the time, it was like this. If you are not Messi or Ronaldo, you have to probably win the Champions League, which we have not done yet. “Give us a few more weeks and we will see where we end up. Sadio wants to contribute, he wants to help the team and that is what I love most about it,” he added.
