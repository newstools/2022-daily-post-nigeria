The President of United Church of Christ in Nigeria (HEKAN), Rev. (Dr.) Amos G. Kiri, on Sunday, in Kaduna warned that the prolonged strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), may lead to increase in criminal activities in the country. He stated this at the 56th Hekan Annual National Convention, held in Kaduna, on Sunday. He said if students who were used to reading and other extra-curriculum activities were left roaming, the devil may have them back, as an idle mind is the devil’s workshop. Reverend Kiri observed that their overstay at home might not be too good in some communities. He, therefore, called on the ASUU and the Federal Government to fast-track dialogue to end the lingering strike. He said as long as they stayed at home, without anything to do, they could be initiated into cultism and drug abuse. “The future, strength and pride of any nation, community or Church are the youth. “Sadly, many of our potential, innovative and future leaders and genus have been bewitched and trapped into devilish and destructive activities that are detrimental to their health and destructive to their lives,” he said.
