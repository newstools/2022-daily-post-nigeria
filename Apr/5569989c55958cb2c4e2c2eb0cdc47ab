Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has named the players who will miss his side’s FA Cup semi-final tie with Crystal Palace on Sunday evening. Tuchel said the likes of Ben Chilwell and Callum Hudson-Odoi would not feature against Crystal Palace at Wembley Stadium. The German said this during his pre-match press conference on Friday. Chelsea head to the game after losing 5-4 on aggregate to Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-final stage in midweek. “Romelu was back in training yesterday. Let’s see if he has any reaction or not,” Tuchel said. “Except for Ben Chilwell and Callum Hudson-Odoi, everybody seems to be okay. We still have two more training sessions to go so fingers crossed it stays like this.” The kick-off time for Chelsea vs Crystal Palace is 4.30 pm.
