Real Madrid goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois, has exposed his team’s major weakness Chelsea could exploit when both sides clash in the Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday. Courtois, a former Chelsea star, said Real Madrid’s lack of intensity is one of their weaknesses. The Belgium international spoke to the press (via Managing Madrid) after Real Madrid’s LaLiga 2-1 victory over Celta Vigo on Saturday. “Chelsea lost at home [against Brentford], but they will be very strong for Wednesday,” Courtois said. “We lack intensity sometimes and Chelsea are good at that.” Real Madrid had eliminated Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League round of 16, while Chelsea knocked Lille out of the tournament.
