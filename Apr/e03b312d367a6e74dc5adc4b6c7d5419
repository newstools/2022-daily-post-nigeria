The National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu has warned the Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir el-Rufai and the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, against criticising their political party. Adamu, a former Governor of Nasarawa State, spoke on BBC Hausa, telling the former Rivers State Governor and the sitting Governor of Kaduna not to use knife and rip open their own stomach. The former federal lawmaker said this in reaction to respective comments made by Amaechi and El-Rufai after the recent attack on a Kaduna-bound train by terrorists. Amaechi had said the tragedy would have been averted if the government had released the N3 billion his ministry had proposed to use for some security installations. On his part, Governor El-Rufai had threatened that Governors in the North-West could opt for the services of foreign mercenaries if attacks continued in the region. Governor El-Rufai’s statement was an indictment on the President Muhammadu Buhari government. Adamu said he would not take issues with the party chieftains but cautioned that “one should not use a knife to rip open his stomach”. “I am a human being, I don’t know what was in their minds when they made their assertions, but I advise you to go and meet them,” he said.
