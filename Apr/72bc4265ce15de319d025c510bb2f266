The All Progressives Congress, APC, has been criticized over the cost of its nomination forms. Deji Adeyanju, an Abuja-based activist lawyer, said the APC would encourage looting and corruption with the Presidential ticket costing N100 million. The party had pegged its nomination forms at N100m for the president, Senate at N20 million and governorship forms at N50 million. Adeyanju said APC flag bearers in the 2023 general elections would loot and not serve. Chatting with DAILY POST, the activist wondered what happened to the change APC promised Nigerians in 2015. According to Adeyanju: “APC fees for Nomination Forms are outrageous and will encourage corruption. It is unreasonable to charge, “Senate – N20M; Governorship – N50M; Presidential – N100M. “This means everyone is going to loot and not to serve. Where’s the 2015 CHANGE that was promised.”
