The Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado-Bayero, has urged the Muslim faithful to use the Ramadan fasting to pray for the country. Ado-Bayero made the call on Friday in his address to the people of the state after the Sultan of Sokoto, Sa’ad Abubakar, announced the sighting of the crescent in some parts of the country. He urged Muslims to devote themselves to praying to the Almighty Allah to address the problems facing the country. The Emir also urged Muslims to assist the needy, particularly the orphans, widows and the less privileged in society. He stressed the importance of peaceful coexistence without which no development can be achieved. Ado-Bayero congratulated Muslims for witnessing the Ramadan fasting of the year, 1443 AH. DAILY POST reports that Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar when Muslims fast. Fasting, one of the five pillars of Islam, is abstinence from eating, drinking and sexual intercourse from dawn to sunset throughout the month.
