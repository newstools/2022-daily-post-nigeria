President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday in Abuja said he would not allow any individual or group destabilise the country. Buhari also urged Nigerians to resist agents bent on causing breakdown of law and order. ‘‘We have the land, we have the resources, and we have the people. But I do not know why people will allow themselves to be successfully subverted to destabilise their own country,’’ the President said at an Iftar dinner with Governors, Ministers and Heads of Government Agencies. He thanked the Governors and Ministers for honouring his invitation to break the Ramadan fast and expressed confidence that in spite of the current security challenges, the country will succeed. Speaking on the forthcoming general elections, Buhari said that being beneficiary of free, fair and credible elections, the introduction of technology and the Permanent Voters Card (PVCs) will make it impossible for anyone to claim millions of votes again in the country.
