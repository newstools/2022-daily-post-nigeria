Former beauty Queen and Nollywood actress, Caroline Danjuma has given reason she married the younger brother of Nigeria’s former defence minister, Gen. TY Danjuma. Speaking in the latest episode of reality show ‘Real housewives of Lagos’, Danjuma said contrary to rumours, she married her ex-husband for love not money. According to her, till date, she still loves her ex-husband and never wanted a divorce. She went further to blame Linda Ikeji for her broken marriage. Caroline said: “Part of the reasons why my marriage broke was because of Linda Ikeji. I reached out to her when she wrote some things but she didn’t care “I married my ex-husband for love not money and I still love him till date. “I’m a perfectionist; I wanted and I’ve always wanted a home. Nobody ever wants a divorce, not even me.” Recall that Caroline’s marriage to Danjuma crashed in 2016 amid allegations of infidelity.
