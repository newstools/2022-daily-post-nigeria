Seven persons have died in an accident that occurred at the Ogunmakin axis of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway in Ogun State. The accident, which happened just opposite the office of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) at about 5:40pm on Friday, involved a Mazda bus, with registration number, LSR696XS and a truck, marked T-4889LA. The FRSC confirmed to DAILY POST that a total of 16 persons were involved in the accident, comprising 15 male adults and one adult. The FRSC spokesperson in Ogun, Florence Okpe, said five men were injured in the crash. Okpe added that six men and a woman lost their lives in the fatal incident. “The injured victims were taken to Victory Hospital, Ogere for medical treatment, while the dead bodies were deposited at FOS morgue, Ipara. “The suspected causes of the crash were excessive speed, which led to the loss of control on the part of the Mazda bus as it ran into the moving truck,” Okpe disclosed. Meanwhile, the Ogun FRSC Sector Commander, Ahmed Umar called for caution, the use of a common sense speed limit, saying the accident was avoidable.
