The National Human Rights Commission on Wednesday said it received over 1.7 million sexual and gender-based violence complaints in 2021. NHRC Director Women and Children Department, Harry Obe, made this known on NTA’s Good Morning Nigeria’s breakfast show while condemning the death of the late popular gospel artiste, Osinachi Nwachukwu. Obe urged persons in abusive relationships to speak up. The NHRC director said, “In 2021, that is last year, the commission received over 1.7 million complaints in total. Out of that about over 900,000 affected women and children and then out of the over 900,000, about 150,000 were on sexual and gender-based violence across the Federation.” According to Obe, the alarming figures means the problem is endemic. “It just takes the bold to speak about it. I’m happy people are beginning to speak about it and that is why we are getting the numbers,” Obe added. Meanwhile, Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen, revealed on the same show that the husband of the late singer is married to another woman.
