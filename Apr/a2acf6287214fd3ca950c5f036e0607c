Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, has insisted they cannot rule out finishing in the Premier League top four, as long as it is “possible mathematically”. Rangnick was speaking to Sky Sports after the Red Devils were held to a 1-1 draw by Leicester City on Saturday. Kelechi Iheanacho opened the scoring for the visitors before Fred equalized just three minutes later. The result leaves United in sixth place with 51 points, three behind Arsenal who currently occupy fourth place and have played two fewer matches. But Rangnick remains bullish about their chances. “As long as it is mathematically possible, we can still do it. “It is our duty, our job, to do our very best and finish the season as strong as possible. “But we look forward to our next game against Everton,” Rangnick said.
