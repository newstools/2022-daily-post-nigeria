One person was confirmed dead while several others were injured as security agents and members of the proscribed Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN), popularly known as Shi’ites, clashed in Kaduna on Saturday. Trouble started when the Shi’ites were on a procession to mark the annual Quds Day, while security agents, who were stationed along major roads in Kaduna and Zaria, tried to disperse members of the group. However, the situation turned violent shortly after the alleged refusal of members of the group to abort the procession. According to an eyewitness, who claimed anonymity, security agents had used teargas and live ammunition at the protesters while some Shi’ites set ablaze several vehicles in Zaria. The IMN Amir in Kaduna, Aliyu Umar, who confirmed the incident, told DAILY POST that the annual Quds Day is a global event and commemorated even in western countries, but wondered why they are frequently haunted by security agents when marking the day. He further added that the procession was peaceful and had tried to avoid the police who were already stationed in strategic positions to block them. “Yet they trailed from behind and used teargas and live bullets on our members, leading to the death of one person. “We have just held the Janazah prayers and nine sustained bullet wounds,” he said. The Amir also alleged that the police arrested about eight members of the group. He denied allegations that a police station was burnt and that the Shi’ites had set ablaze vehicles. The Kaduna State Police Command Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige did not pick up his calls for comments.
