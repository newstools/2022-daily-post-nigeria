Manchester United have confirmed the departure of Jim Lawlor and Marcel Bout. Lawlor has been chief scout of Man United for 16 years after he was brought in under Sir Alex Ferguson in 2005. Bout, on the other hand, joined Man United as part of Louis van Gaal’s backroom team in 2014 and was appointed the club’s head of global scouting two years later. This is coming less than 24 hours after their 4-0 defeat to Liverpool in a Premier League tie on Tuesday. A club statement read: “Jim Lawlor has decided to step down from his role as chief scout in the summer after 16 years with the club. “Jim leaves the club with our warmest thanks for his significant contribution and our very best wishes for the future.” The club statement added: “Marcel Bout has departed from his role as head of global scouting after eight years with the club. “Marcel leaves the club with our warmest thanks for his significant contribution and our very best wishes for the future.”
