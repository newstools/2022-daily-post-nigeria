A Presidential aspirant on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Adamu Garba has condemned the party’s price for its presidential nomination forms. APC had earlier announced that aspirants seeking to contest for the 2023 presidency would pay N100m to buy forms. The APC explained that the nomination form would go for N70 million while the expression of interest form costs N30 million. Reacting, Garba, who had earlier announced his intention to join the presidential race said the price tag is as good as buying political offices. Garba asked Nigerians to condemn the development to save Nigeria from being strangled by ‘moneybags’. His tweet read, “If we don’t come together and use our collective power to save this country from the strangulation of the moneybags, we are doing a great disservice to our generation and that of the future. “We cannot continue to buy political offices in Nigeria, we need competent leaders come 2023.”
