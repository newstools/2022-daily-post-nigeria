The National Women Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Beta Edu has said the ruling party would not consider giving its presidential ticket to aspirants that won’t favour women. She noted that APC women would negotiate with all the presidential aspirants to obtain their commitment and what the women stand to gain if given the opportunity to lead Nigeria. Edu disclosed this on Tuesday at the national secretariat of the party in Abuja during a solidarity visit by the Women wing of Yahaya Bello Presidential Campaign Team. She said: “But one thing is certain APC will not give its tickets to a presidential candidate who will not favour women. We know our President and all the glass ceilings he has broken. You know our party chairman and all the glass ceilings he has broken for women; giving us free forms.” The women leader also noted that all the presidential aspirants coming out from the ruling APC are all good and above average. She added: “The aspirants that are coming out for the presidential tickets in APC are not in any way even close to average. They are high above and far above board. I have not seen one that is not good. “Now as a party, our party will come together under the leadership of President Muhamadu Buhari and of course the national chairman and other leadership structures of our party to decide on who will be the candidate of our dear party.
