A member of the Ondo State House of Assembly, Oluwole Ogunmolasuyi, was during the week chased out of his constituency by youths over alleged non-performance. Ogunmolasuyi, popularly known as ‘West’ who is also the Majority Leader of the assembly escaped by the whiskers after the youths, who kicked against imposition, made moves to attack him and his entourage. The incident was said to have happened at the Iloro community when Ogunmolasuyi, representing Owo Constituency 1 went to the area to seek their support ahead of the 2023 election. According to sources, some All Progressives Congress (APC) leaders in the area were present when the youths stormed the meeting. In a viral video, the youths were seen raining curses on the lawmaker and his entourage while they were chasing them out of the area. An armed policeman supposedly, Ogunmolasuyi’s orderly and others were seen running in the video. When contacted, Ogunmolasuyi said he was attacked by thugs mobilized by his opponents in the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, adding that he has done a commendable job in distributing scholarships, palliatives, and other developmental projects. The lawmaker claimed that he was in Iloro for a meeting when a PDP aspirant sent thugs to the location. “Nobody can chase me away. It can never happen. We held a meeting at Iloro Ward and after I left I was told there was an attack by the PDP people. “I was not there for general campaign, I was there to meet with my party people. It was after I left. Those people in the video are thugs. I had left and was told there was a video circulating. “Those guys are thugs. Those guys are not the people that will reject anybody. They were all PDP people.” Meanwhile, the Publicity Secretary of PDP in the state, Kennedy Peretei, dismissed the allegation, he stated that it was APC members that drove Ogunmolasuyi out of a ward meeting.
