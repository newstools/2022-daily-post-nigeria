Super Eagles goalkeeper, Francis Uzoho, has taken all the blame for Nigeria’s failure to qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The goalkeeper promised to make sure he returns the smiles on the faces of Nigerian supporters. It was Uzoho’s error that gave Ghana their only goal at the Moshood Abiola Stadium last week which denied Nigeria a place in Qatar in November. The goalkeeper has remained silent since then despite backlashes he receives from supporters of the national team. However, he has now broken his silence on Nigeria’s failure to qualify for the World Cup after a 1-1 draw with Ghana. A shot from Arsenal’s Ghana captain Thomas Partey squirmed under his body and went into the net and Uzoho was disappointed with himself. He blamed himself for the Super Eagles not qualifying for the mundial and has vowed to atone for his error in subsequent matches. Writing on Instagram, the 2013 U17 World Cup winner said: “This past couple of days has been the worst in my lifetime. “I wanted to take my nation to Qatar but rather did the opposite. I know what football means to you all and to myself, I can’t promise not to make mistakes again but I can promise not to give up until I bring back that smile on your faces. “Thank you for the support and God bless”.
