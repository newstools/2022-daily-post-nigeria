Former lawmaker, Senator Shehu Sani has alleged that the bloodthirsty armed men, who abducted passengers of the Abuja-Kaduna train, were ‘jihadist’ terrorists. Recall that the assailants, who attacked the train on its way to Kaduna State on March 27, killed some passengers, injured scores while over hundred were kidnaped. The bandits have in a recent video, asked the Federal Government to act fast, else the abductees would be killed, saying they are not after ransom. However, the Kaduna State governorship aspirant in the forthcoming 2023 general elections said the video shows the criminal elements are not just bandits. In a tweet on his verified Twitter handle, the former lawmaker, who represented Kaduna Central, at the 8th assembly, called on relevant authorities to ensure that those abducted are freed. The tweet reads, “The video footage of the Train terrorists & their hostages making demands to the Government confirmed the fact that the cruel abductors were not just bandits but ‘Jihadist’ terrorists. “Authorities must walk the tight rope of freeing the hostages without bowing to terrorists”.
