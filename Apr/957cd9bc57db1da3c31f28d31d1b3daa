Gospel musician, Frank Edwards, has reacted to the death of popular Nigerian gospel musician, Osinachi Nwachukwu. DAILY POST had reported that the talented musician, who was popular for her hit song, ‘Ekwueme’ died on Friday. It was gathered that she died after battling an undisclosed illness. However, reports on social media had claimed that she suffered domestic violence. It was alleged on Saturday that her husband abused her and was hospitalized before giving up the ghost. Reacting on his Instagram page, Frank Edwards said an unreasonable human put off her shining light. He wrote, “So that Unreasonable human being finally put off a shining light. “I won’t say much now, I’ll let the former NDDC director (AUNTY Joy) who did everything possible to stop this from happening talk 1st, but it still happened. We tried to stop this.”
