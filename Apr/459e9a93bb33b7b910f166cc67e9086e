Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has admitted that his side’s chances of turning their Champions League quarter-final second leg tie against Real Madrid on Tuesday night at the Santiago Bernabeu is slim. Chelsea lost 3-1 against Real Madrid in the first leg last week at Stamford Bridge. And Tuchel believes the second leg tie in Spain will not be easy given the competition, opponent and the stadium. Chelsea head to the game after beating Southampton 6-0 in a Premier League tie over the weekend, while Real Madrid defeated Getafe 2-0 in the LaLiga. In terms of Chelsea’s chances of turning the tie around, Tuchel told reporters on Monday during his pre-match press conference: “Not the biggest chance given the first game’s results and given the competition and the opponent and the Stadium. “We never manage our input by the chances we have for our result. “It is unlikely, but it is worth trying and trying means that we will play to our fullest and to our full limit. This is what it is, it is a big night.”
