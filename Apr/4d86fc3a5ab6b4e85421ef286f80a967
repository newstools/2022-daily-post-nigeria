Arsenal striker, Alexandre Lacazette has revealed he did not like former teammate, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang when the Gabonese first arrived the club. He said he had some misconceptions about the former Borussia Dortmund attacker before he moved to Arsenal in 2018. The 32-year-old Aubameyang left the Emirates in the winter transfer to join Barcelona after falling out-of-favour with boss, Mikel Arteta. Aubameyang and Lacazette, as Arsenal’s leading strikers, enjoyed a close friendship together and performed well when selected as strike partners before the Gabon International left for Camp Nou. However, Lacazette said he disliked Aubameyang’s social media activity prior to the striker’s arrival. “I had some misconceptions about him. Before he arrived, I didn’t like him. To be honest, I’m not mate with the Aubemayang you see on Instagram. “I’m mates with Pierre-Emerick. People don’t know Pierre-Emerick. They know Aubameyang,” the France international told Canal+.
