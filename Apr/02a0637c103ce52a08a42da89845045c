Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has said the best way to tame the unknown gunmen wreaking havoc in the South East is to invest in security intelligence. The governor who is also seeking the presidential ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP ahead of the 2023 election, stated this in an interview with BBC Pidgin. According to Wike, fighting insecurity is beyond procuring weapons, urging the government to be proactive in tackling the challenges in the Southeast by prioritizing intelligence gathering. When asked to identify the unknown gunmen, the governor declined, saying “since they said the gunmen are unknown, so they remain unknown”. According to him, “It is not just about procuring weapons for the security operatives, government needs to spend money on intelligence. When Russia was about to invade Ukraine, Ukrainian forces were not aware but America, because of their intelligence, alerted Ukraine. “You don’t need to wait till an incident occurs before you act. Governance is all about protecting lives and property, if you are not good at that, you have no business with the government. “If everybody is dead, who would use the infrastructure you are putting up”?
