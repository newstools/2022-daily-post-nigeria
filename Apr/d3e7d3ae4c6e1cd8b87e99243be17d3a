All the 32 countries that qualified for the 2022 World Cup, will receive $1.5m each to prepare for the tournament. The eventual winner of the trophy will take home $42m, while the runners-up and third-place teams pocket $30m and $27m respectively. The fourth-place nations will go home with $25m, fifth to eighth places will receive $17m, while $13m will go to ninth to the 16th placed teams. Interestingly, the 17th to 32nd placed countries will not go empty-handed as they will get $9m. FIFA President, Gianni Infantino, recently revealed that the world football ruling body is eyeing a record $7bn revenue from the World cup in Qatar. It is expected to overtake the previous revenue by $600m. Nigeria, who have missed out on a seventh World cup appearance, will not be part of this largesse. The Super Eagles failed to pick a ticket, after drawing 1-1 with Ghana in Abuja, losing out on an away goal.
