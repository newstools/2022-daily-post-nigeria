Peter Obi, a Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Presidential aspirant and former Governor of Anambra State, has stated that a consensus candidate is not the answer to the country’s many challenges. According to him, the consensus structure demanded by some aspirants is not what Nigeria requires right now. Obi spoke at a meeting with PDP chieftains in Akure, Ondo State’s capital, on Sunday, ahead of the party’s upcoming primary. While bemoaning the poor state and neglect of the Akure-Ado Ekiti road, the former Anambra State Governor declared that it could be fixed for just N5 billion. Obi also urged Nigerians to vote out the All Progressives Congress, APC, in 2023, claiming that the party had pushed the country backwards. “Nigeria is its darkest days. The country is collapsing and the only thing we are hearing is kidnapping, banditry poverty. “Schools are shut down, killings are everywhere and this is the cumulative effect of the bad leadership. ”What the country needs at this particular period is somebody who can turn around the economy of the country and not a consensus candidate “With just N5 billion, the Akure/Ado-Ekiti road will be fixed, but all this money they are borrowing is for consumption. The only thing you hear is sharing formula not production formula,” he said.
