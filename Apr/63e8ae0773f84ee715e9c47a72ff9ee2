The Islamic State’s West Africa Province (ISWAP) has eliminated a top Boko Haram commander, Mohammed Reejal. Reejal was taken out on Sunday at Tokombare, a location within Sambisa Forest. ISWAP attacked dozens of their rivals who were heading to a nearby destination. Apart from Reejal, some Boko Haram members were also killed in seeming retaliation. In late March, Boko Haram ambushed and killed ISWAP members near Lake Chad in a renewed war of supremacy. Boko Haram fighters loyal to Buduma paraded the captives, slaughtered and dumped them in makeshift graves. The captors further set fire to some gun trucks after ordering ISWAP insurgents to remain inside.
