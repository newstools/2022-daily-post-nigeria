For failing to pay ransom to their kidnappers, three out of those kidnapped from Ungwan Bulus in the Chikun local government area of Kaduna State, have been killed by their abductors. The remaining abductees who failed to pay their ransom are also to be executed by the terrorists according to reports. The Chief of Ungwan Bulus community, Gideon Haruna Goni confirmed the story to newsmen, saying the terrorists called the community to inform them to go and pick the corpses of those killed around Dutse Community, along the Kaduna-Abuja highway. He said, “The terrorists called that if they don’t pay the N20m before 12pm on Tuesday (April 19, 2022), others would be assassinated.” The kidnappers according to the chief, have threatened to kill more, especially women if their demands are not met. DAILY POST recalls that two were killed, 26 were abducted and one was released on health grounds. He appealed to the criminals not to kill anyone and called on the Kaduna and federal governments as well as religious clerics to come to their rescue to prevent the killings of more victims.
