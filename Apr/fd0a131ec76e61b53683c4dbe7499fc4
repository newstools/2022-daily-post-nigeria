Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has sworn in two new Advisers. They are Terver Akase, the immediate past Chief Press Secretary who had resigned in 2021 to contest in the 2023 governorship election and Andrew Kputu. The governor at the ceremony in the Benue Peoples House, Makurdi, said the appointment of the new advisers became necessary to increase the number of those giving quality services to the state. The governor also said apart from the policy of his administration to encourage and empower the youths, the duo merited the appointments having prepared themselves and shown the capacity to deliver. He particularly expressed optimism that as a geologist, Kputu would deploy his wealth of experience to ensure that the state maximize the benefit of having mineral resources, especially gold that has just been discovered in Kwande Local Government. Governor Ortom enjoined the new Special Advisers to acquaint themselves and be guided by the policy document of his administration as well as the PDP constitution to be able to discharge their duties effectively. Responding on behalf of his colleagues, Hon. Akase expressed gratitude to Governor Ortom for giving them the opportunity to serve the state and promised to do their best to add value to the administration. While Akase was assigned Media and Publicity portfolio, Kputu is to take charge of Solid Minerals and Mining.
