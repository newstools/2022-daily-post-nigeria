The political atmosphere in Zamfara State has become tense since the announcement by the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) that former Governor Abdulaziz Yari and Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa and their supporters joined the party. A chieftain of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), Abubakar Yarima Bomo, however, in a statement said the battle is yet to be won by the PDP as claimed, He insisted it is not yet over until Yari and Marafa make public declarations of the party of their choice. “We have also engaged the duo and serious consultation is going on to woo the two political heavyweights in the State. “Everybody in Zamfara State knows that former Governor Abdulaziz Yari and Senator Kabiru Garba Mafara are great materials and no party would afford to miss them politically due to their political prowess” Bomo said the PDP should not be jubilating now as they are believing that they have won over the hearts of former Governor Abdulaziz Yari and Senator Kabiru Garba Mafara, warning that the battle over who wins the souls of the two political heavyweights in the State is still ongoing. “I was amazed as the former Governor and senator Marafa came out publicly to declare that they have not consented to any political party” The NNPP chieftain claimed the State chairman of the PDP, Bala Mande was forced from the PDP national Secretariat to quickly announce the defection of former Governor Abdulaziz Yari and Senator Kabiru Garba Mafara out of overzealousness. “The PDP thought that they were playing a fast game but they failed to understand that the likes of former Governor Abdulaziz Yari and senator Kabiru Garba Mafara are not newcomers in Zamfara State politics and can never change their minds” “The two political heavyweights in Zamfara State have publicly said they have decided to dump APC and did not mention their next line of action since negotiations with other political parties is still ongoing ” “We, therefore, urge former Governor Abdulaziz Yari and Senator Kabiru Garba Mafara to as a matter of urgency embrace the political party that would adjust to their interest” When contacted, the Publicity Chairman of the Abdulaziz Yari camp, Ibrahim Birinin Magaji said the two political heavyweights in the state would announce to their teeming supporters when they are done.
