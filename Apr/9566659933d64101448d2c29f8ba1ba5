Former Secretary to Ekiti Government, Modupe Alade, on Friday dismissed insinuations in certain quarters that she had parted ways with former Gov. Ayo Fayose. Mrs. Alade spoke to Journalists in Ifaki-Ekiti, at the close of burial of her mother-on-law, Mrs Dorcas Abike Alade. According to her, Fayose was her mentor, and would, therefore, remain loyal to him, having appointed her SSG during his second term tenure as governor, after she retired as Permanent Secretary in the State Public Service. She said the fact that her posters are not found dotting the streets and walls, seeking one political office or the other under the current political dispensation, did not mean she had called it quit with politics because of anybody. “I am still very much in politics, and a proud member of PDP for that matter. I have neither called it quits with PDP or Fayose or anybody for that matter. I still remain in PDP till this time of speaking with you, so where is the crisis? “The only thing I think has happened which I can not control, is that I am never interested in seeking elective offices, and this is probably due to the civil service blood that is still flowing in me, even as a retired Permanent Secretary. “Though ideologies may differ some of the time, there is no crisis between me and Ex-governor Fayose. I will tell you he remains my mentor, and I am still loyal to him. Do not forget that he was the one that appointed me Secretary to the State Government at a time”, she said.
