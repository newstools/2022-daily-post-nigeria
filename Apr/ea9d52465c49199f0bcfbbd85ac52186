Kidnappers of the abducted traditional ruler of Bukpe community in Kwali Area Council of the FCT, Hassan Shamidozhi have given the family 24 hours to raise N6 million or risk his death. The traditional ruler was abducted two weeks ago and a ransom of N20m placed on his head. The ransom was, however, slashed to N6 million following negotiations. A source from the traditional ruler’s family told DAILY POST that the abductors called on phone and threatened to kill the traditional ruler if the family failed to raise the N6 million in the next 24 hours. He said, “It was just today (Wednesday) around 10am that they called and threatened to kill the chief if the family fails to bring N6m after 24 hours. The threat has thrown the entire family into confusion as we don’t know how to raise the N6m.”# The source solicited the help of security agents in rescuing the paramount ruler. The spokesperson of the FCT Police Command, DSP Adeh Josephine, did not respond to a phone call put to her to confirm the information.
