Arsenal and Chelsea former stars, Paul Merson and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink have given their separate predictions on who will grab the top four spot in the Premier League at the end of the season. Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United are battling for the last spot that will guarantee their appearance in the Champions League next season. Manchester City, Liverpool, and Chelsea have already qualified for the Champions League. Arsenal bounced back from three straight defeats to beat Chelsea 4-2 at Stamford on Wednesday and United suffered a 4-0 defeat to Liverpool on Tuesday. Just three points separate the three teams now But with Manchester United struggling more than the other teams in the race and having played a game more than the others, many pundits have written them off and believe the top four race is now firmly between Tottenham and Arsenal. Merson and Hasselbaink said there is no way in for Manchester United, but the two disagree on which club will triumph in the end. “I think Arsenal have an advantage, I really do,” Merson told Sky Sports, citing the Gunners’ easier run-in of games. “I don’t think Tottenham beat Brentford away, Brentford are flying, absolutely flying at the moment. I think Arsenal’s a hard game. “I know Man United have been terrible, but who doesn’t want to turn up at the Emirates and play football on that pitch. “It’s about timing now. West Ham away is a hard game, but it’s in between Frankfurt [in the Europa League semi-final] so will they rest all their players?” He queried. “I think it’s going to be very close. Before the match tonight, I was more with Spurs because of their fire power and Arsenal had difficulties scoring. “I am still with Spurs. Yes, the north London derby is going to be a big, big match, but I just think Spurs have Kane and Conte. They know how to win games,” said Hasselbaink on Sky Sports. Arsenal welcome Manchester United at the Emirates on Saturday, the same day Tottenham travel to Brentford.
