Russian air defence units say they have shot down a Ukrainian military plane carrying a shipment of weapons sent by Western countries. The attack took place outside the city of Odessa in south-west Ukraine, Russian State news agency, TASS reported, quoting Defence Ministry spokesman, Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov as saying on Saturday. “Near Odessa Russian anti-aircraft defense forces have shot down a Ukrainian military transport plane, which was delivering a large shipment of arms supplied to Ukraine by Western counties,” Konashenkov said. Konashenkov also claimed that in the last 24 hours, Russian air units had hit dozens of locations with a concentration of Ukrainian military troops or hardware. Recall that the war between Russia and Ukraine started in February this year. The war enters day 53 as of today and several casualties have already been recorded as a result of the conflict. Russian President, Vladimir Putin, had ordered the invasion of Ukraine due to political differences between both nations.
