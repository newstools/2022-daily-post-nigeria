A member of the House of Representatives, Yusuf Gagdi, has disclosed that the Department of Security Services (DSS) got intelligence on the location of the terrorists that killed about 100 persons in Plateau State. Gagdi disclosed this on Wednesday while moving a motion on the recent killings in the state. He noted that 92 persons were killed in the attack and 20 persons were injured. In addition, over 3000 people have been internally displaced by the violence. The lawmaker expressed dismay with the security agencies for not acting on intelligence at their disposal. He noted that even the base of the terrorists is known to the security agencies. “Disturbed that despite intelligent reports by the Department of State Service, on the influx of terrorists fleeing to Plateau and other neighbouring communities of Wase and Kanam Local Government Areas, no proactive measures were initiated by security agencies to avert these ugly terror attacks. “The security agencies have reliable information at their disposal of the various camps of these terrorists in Kambari forest in Taraba State as well as Bangala in Wase Local Government Area of Plateau State where these terrorists used to organize and coordinate attacks on innocent citizens of Plateau State and other parts of Nigeria,” he said. The House thereby directed the military and police to deploy a joint task force to the region.
