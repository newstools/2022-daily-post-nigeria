Five persons, including two nuns, were incinerated at dawn on Wednesday when two vehicles collided at Nawfia on Enugu-Awka Expressway in Anambra. Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Sector Commander in Anambra, Mr Adeoye Irelewuyi, said the collision was attributable to excessive speeding. “The fatal crash involved a Toyota Highlander with registration number; BMR 570 BE and an unregistered Toyota Hiace bus. “According to an eyewitness, the bus driver, conveying the nuns was speeding excessively; lost control of the vehicle, rammed into the Highlander from behind and both vehicles caught fire. “Five persons, two male adults and three female adults were involved in the crash when the vehicles burst into flames and they were completely burnt. “The Anambra Fire Service has been able to put out the fire. “The FRSC rescue team from Awka is on ground managing traffic and ensuring that the obstruction caused by the crash is removed,’’ Irelewuyi said. While condoling with the families of the victims, Irelewuyi warned motorists to avoid excessive speeding and keep to recommend speed limits. NAN reports that the occupants of the Toyota Hiace bus were the two nuns and their driver while a couple were the occupants of the Toyota Highlander.
