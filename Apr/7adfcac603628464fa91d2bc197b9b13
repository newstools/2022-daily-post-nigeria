Paris Saint-Germain forward, Neymar has hit back at former Liverpool defender, Fabio Aurelio over his criticism of the Brazil star for failing to win the Ballon d’Or during his time at Parisians. Aurelio had claimed Neymar should be upset for not winning the Ballon d’ Or in his career so far, adding that Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo played at the top level for 15 years. But Neymar has now launched an X-rated response on his Instagram account on Monday. The Brazilian international wrote: “I’m tired of these ex-players who are there and only open their mouths to talk sh*t. “A five minute interview and all he did was talk about other people’s lives. “If you want to criticize, criticize. But talking sh*t like that is not possible.” Neymar also shared a list of his individual awards, as well as the silverware he has won with PSG, Barcelona and Brazil. He wrote a caption saying: “I’m really disappointed wow. And I haven’t even put it all yet.”
