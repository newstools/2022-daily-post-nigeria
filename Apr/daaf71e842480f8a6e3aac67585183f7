American rapper and actor, Kaalan Walker, has been found guilty of multiple rapes committed between 2013 and 2018. According to Rolling Stone, the actor who starred in the 2018 Superfly reboot, was convicted of raping seven victims, three of whom were 16-year-old aspiring models. The actor broke down in tears when he was read the split verdict from the Los Angeles jury. Recall that Walker was accused of sexual assault in 2021 by over 30 teens and young women who alleged that he used his fame and promised to introduce them to Drake and other celebrities. He was arrested on charges of forcible rape, unlawful intercourse with a minor, and other felonies related to 11 of the victims in Los Angeles County. “I did not rape anybody, your honour!” Walker shouted as he was led away in handcuffs. The actor faces up to 100 years to life for his crimes. Walker’s lawyer Andrew Flier, reacting to the verdict said he’s disappointed and plans to appeal the verdict. “I don’t think he got a fair trial, and the fact that he had three acquittals on three of the victims speaks volumes,” Flier added. He complained that the judge refused them to call witnesses about that same issue, but on the reverse.
