The Adamawa State chapter of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) has constituted new state executives. The party has also picked executives for the 21 local government areas and the 226 wards through affirmation at the party congresses held in the state capital, Yola. After the Congress, the Chairman of the Electoral Panel, Abubakar Dogara, announced Alhaji Abubakar Yusuf as the newly elected state Chairman while Mr Danjuma Chikalu emerged as the vice Chairman and Mr Nafama Thimnu the secretary, among other officials. The SDP was a strong party just before and after the 2019 election in Adamawa but its life wire and governorship candidate, Chief Emmanuel Bello, defected from it towards the end of last year into the All Progressives Congress (APC), leaving the SDP hollow. However, a former governorship aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state, Barr Umar Ardo, recently defected to the SDP, giving it a new lease of life. Speaking at the venue of the congress in Yola, Dr Umar Ardo who is a governorship aspirant of the SDP, described the congress as very peaceful. Ardo, a vocal and controversial politician who was always in one legal battle or the other against the PDP and eventually formed a splinter faction he named rPDP before finally quitting the PDP, said that SDP was out to rescue Nigeria and Adamawa state from the challenges of insecurity brought to them by the All progressives Congress (APC) and PDP. He said the APC and PDP destroyed the country and citizens should chase them out of governance. “APC and PDP destroyed this country. That is why we have issues of kidnapping, banditry, insurgency, unwarranted killings and a paralyzed economy. ”I took PDP to court 11 times to disagree with some actions that were questionable, so l am never part of destruction,” Umar Ardo said.
