Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, Minister of Interior on Friday, denied reports of swap of inmates in the custody of the Nigerian Correctional Service with free citizens. Aregbesola gave the denial while speaking at the third and fourth quarter 2021 performance review meeting of the ministry on Friday. He described the allegations as worrisome and said it was false. “There is a minimum setback between our facilities and human development areas, but if it’s not being enforced at some correctional services, we will ensure the enforcement,’’ he said. He, therefore, assured Nigerians that no swapping would be tolerated under his watch. He stressed that the government would further secure already properly-secured facilities of the Nigeria Correctional Services.
