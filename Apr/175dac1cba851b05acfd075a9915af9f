Former Chelsea midfielder, Joe Cole, has told Romelu Lukaku that he has six weeks to save his career at the club. Cole stated this while speaking on ITV after the Blues’ 2-0 win over Crystal Palace in the FA Cup semi-final on Sunday. Lukaku started the game from the bench, coming on late to replace Kai Havertz. The Belgian has not started a Premier League fixture in over two months and is yet to score in the league this year. Cole said: “He’s got six weeks to save his Chelsea career if he wants it. “You look at Timo Werner who doesn’t give up and when he doesn’t score a goal he’s offering something else. “With Lukaku he wants to be that focal point but he missed a chance and we were in the studio [saying] if it’s not going for you, it’s not going for you. He gets it all wrong, opens his body up and hits the post. And he will be gutted for himself because he’s better than that.”
