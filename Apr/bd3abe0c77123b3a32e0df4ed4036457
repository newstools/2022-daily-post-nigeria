The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) has made clarifications concerning Nigerians and some electricity issues. In a statement on Sunday, the agency led by Babatunde Irukera, declared that it is not the responsibility of customers or communities to fix equipment. These include the purchase, replacement or repair of transformers, poles or other requirements in the distribution of electricity. FCCPC said Distribution Companies (DisCos) are required to replace damaged transformers within 48 hours of official notification. If they are unable to do so, residents may enter into a written agreement on terms of replacement with the DisCo for appropriate refund/compensation. Also, such a deal must be in accordance with the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) Investment in Electricity Networks Regulation. The commission added that customers can purchase meters using the Meter Asset Provider (MAP) Framework. “However, DisCos are responsible for refunding or compensating customers who paid in advance for the meters. “The cost of the meter is to be reimbursed in 36 equal monthly payments using consumer-purchased energy credits (tokens)”, the statement noted.
