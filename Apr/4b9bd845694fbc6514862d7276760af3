The National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) has had its activities banned by the Ondo State Government, alleging a “prolonged crisis” within the union. Following the suspension, a park management committee was constituted to oversee all of the state’s motor parks. Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu issued the directive over the weekend through his deputy, Lucky Ayedatiwa. Jacob Adebo also known as ‘Idajo’ (Chairman), Festus Obasooto (Vice Chairman), and Bayode Gbenga (Vice Chairman) were appointed to the park management committee (Secretary). Gbonya Oyedepo Adeniyi, Olalekan Awojobi, Ojo Olanipekun, Bamidele Olopade, Sunday Olawuyi, Ogedegbe Ogunmuyiwa, Ademola Odudu, Jones Akinrinlola, Akinyosade Akinolu, Ezekiel Ademola were among the other members of the committee. The committee also includes Johnson Akinribisi, Emidun Simeon, Lawrence Ikuomehinola, Olowere Amos, Tojue Atijosan, Ogunwo Olusegun, Oyedele Monebi, and High Chief Ariyo. Some NURTW members in the state had previously protested against what they described as the state government’s meddling in the activities of the union’s state council. The protesting drivers in Owo, Owo Local Government Area of the state, said that there was a plot by people in the state’s corridors of power to utilize the state machinery to proscribe the union if members refused to accept the immediate past chairman’s (Jacob Adebo) imposition. The union, on the other hand, recommended the state government to let the union’s Constitution, which mandated elections, run its course.
