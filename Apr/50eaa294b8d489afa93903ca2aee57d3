Billionaire singer and entrepreneur Rihanna, has shared reasons why she refused to hide her baby bump in public. The singer had in January confirmed she was expecting her first child with boyfriend, ASAP Rocky, which went viral on the internet. Following her announcement, Rihanna has bared her baby bump as she attended several public functions including award shows. Speaking with the Vogue, Rihanna who was featured on the May cover story disclosed that being pregnant is a thing of celebration which should not be hidden. The Business mogul mentioned that immediately she found out she was pregnant she decided not to shop for maternity clothes. “When I found out I was pregnant, I thought to myself, there is no way I’m going to go shopping in no maternity aisle. “ My body is doing incredible things right now, and I’m not going to be ashamed of that, This time should feel celebratory because why should you be hiding your pregnancy? “I’m sorry, it’s too much fun to get dressed up and I am not going to let that part disappear because my body is changing,” she said. Rihanna urged the society to redefine “what is considered decent” for pregnant women. When asked what frightens her the most about pregnancy, Rihana said, “Postpartum depression” “I ask myself will I feel out of control emotionally? Those are the stories I hear from other women that scare me.”
