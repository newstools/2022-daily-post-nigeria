The main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has called on the security agencies, especially the anti-corruption agencies, to immediately commence an investigation of all the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential aspirants who pay N100 million or N50 million to buy nomination and interest forms. This was contained in a statement by PDP national chairman Iyorchia Ayu, signed by his communications secretary, Simon Imobo-Tswam. “This is a confusing and unsympathetic act by the ruling party. Those who buy the N100 million and N50 million nomination forms should be investigated for fraud,” he said. His comments came after the APC’s announcement on the price of the nomination and interest forms. PDP said by selling the forms at a cost of N100 million for presidential aspirants showed that APC is a crook and hypocrites party. The PDP has set its presidential form price at N40 million, and so far, 17 candidates have declared their intention to run.
