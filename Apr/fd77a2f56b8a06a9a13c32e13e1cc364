The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) on Wednesday said it would conduct a thorough investigation into the cause of its Super Mushshak trainer aircraft crash that happened on Tuesday at NAF Base, Kaduna. The Director of Public Relations and Information, NAF Headquarters, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, said this in a statement on Wednesday in Abuja. He disclosed that the Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, paid a visit to the two pilots’ families, friends, and colleagues who lost their lives in the tragic incident. The state constituted an Accident Investigation Board upon receiving the sad news of the crash to determine the immediate and remote causes. The CAS assured the officers, airmen, and airwomen of 401 Flying Training School (FTS ), Kaduna, that all measures would be implemented to avert similar occurrence in the future. “The unfortunate incident of trainer aircraft crash is yet again a tragic reminder of the perilous nature of the military flying profession and the risks NAF pilots continually take daily to secure Nigeria’s territorial integrity,” the statement read.
