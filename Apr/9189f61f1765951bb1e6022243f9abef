Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti, has said his players will not underestimate Chelsea in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final. Ancelotti also dismissed Thomas Tuchel’s suggestion the tie is over. Madrid go into the second leg at the Bernabeu with a 3-1 advantage, but Ancelotti insists they will be taking nothing for granted on Tuesday against his former club. “Chelsea are here to bring the fight to us. “It will be tough for them of course but they will try. Good teams never give up,” Ancelotti said during his press conference. Chelsea bounced back from the defeat with a 6-0 hammering of Southampton in the Premier League and Ancelotti admits the Blues may take encouragement from Barcelona thrashing Madrid 4-0 only three weeks ago. “I know my players very well. They are well aware of what happened a few weeks ago (against Barca) and what is required tomorrow. We won’t be underestimating anyone. “This is a great opportunity to reach the semis but Chelsea are a very good team. We have to respect them,” Ancelotti added.
