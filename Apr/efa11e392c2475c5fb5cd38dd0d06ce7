The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, Ekiti State Command has called on monarchs, community leaders and land owners to be wary of people they offer land to for farming. State commander of the Agency, Mr. Anthony Ariyo-Olowoniyi made the call while speaking with newsmen in Ado-Ekiti on the new initiative set up by the command, known as War Against Drug Abuse, WADA. According to Mr. Ariyo-Owoniyi, some of the people offered lands in communities have been using such lands for cultivation of India hemp and other illegal activities. He noted that whenever such farmers were arrested, those who offered them land would also be arrested and prosecuted alongside the culprit without any preference. The NDLEA commander appealed to youths to desist from drug abuse due to its health implications, which include, insanity, psychological problem, damage of the heart and even death.
