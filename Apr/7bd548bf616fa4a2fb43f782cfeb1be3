A popular Nigerian cleric, Pastor Adewale Giwa has raised the alarm over the move by some persons to use his name to perpetrate fraudulent activities on social media. According to the cleric, who described those behind the act as unscrupulous elements, the fraudsters had opened a bogus Facebook account in his name in order to swindle the unsuspecting public. Giwa had earlier this week disclosed his decision to exit the popular social media platform after his monthly prayer and bible verse post were deleted by Facebook. The accounts which were unknown to the pastor were opened shortly after he announced that he will not be making use of Facebook over the deletion of his post. While urging the public to be conscious of the move by the fraudsters, Giwa noted that he has not given anyone approval to operate social media in his name. He also disclosed that steps had been taken to report the development in order to prevent the fraudsters from perpetrating criminal and devilish acts with it.
