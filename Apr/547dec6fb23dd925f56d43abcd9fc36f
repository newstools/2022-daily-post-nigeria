A family member of the deceased, Malam Salisu Gambo told DAILY POST that the incident happened last Friday night He said initially Murtala Gambo was said to have been shot by suspected armed robbers but letter it was discovered he was killed by men of the NDLEA. DAILY POST gathered that there was unease in the village when NDLEA officials stormed the market in an attempt to arrest some suspected dealers of illicit drugs. “Unfortunately they came back to the town on Friday midnight and shot my innocent son who has no any record of even smoking cigarette” An eyewitness, Musa Danburga also told DAILY POST that the incident happened around 3am when the deceased was praying behind their livestock park where they shot him. He said the unknown people quickly zoomed off and from there and he discovered it was the men of NDLEA on their official vehicle. Musa said the deceased was rushed to the hospital where he was admitted and died two days later as a result of bullet injuries. The family called on the government to intervene and bring the perpetrators to book. Efforts to speak to the NDLEA official on the issue proved abortive at the time of filing this report.
