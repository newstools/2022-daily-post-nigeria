The Osun State Ministry of Women, Children and Social Affairs says a baby boy has been abandoned in a maternity home by his parents in Ilesa, hours after his premature birth. In a statement by Jide Falade, the Coordinating Director in the ministry and obtained by DAILY POST, the mother of the child was reportedly rushed to Aseyori Ni Temi Clinic and Maternity Home by her husband and mother-in-law on Monday, February 14, 2022, with a complaint of stomach ache. Falade explained that after several medical examinations were carried out on her, she gave birth to a premature baby boy. He hinted that some hours thereafter, his parents and grandmother absconded, leaving him behind. According to the Coordinating Director, all efforts made by the Police and the Ministry to locate the runaway parents had been fruitless so far. He, therefore, appealed to the members of the public to assist in locating the relatives or parents of the baby.
