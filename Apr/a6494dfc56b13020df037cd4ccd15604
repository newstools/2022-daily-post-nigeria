Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand, has sympathised with captain Harry Maguire after news emerged on Thursday that Cheshire Police went to his house after a fake bomb threat was made. Recall that Maguire was subject to a bomb threat which led to police and sniffer dogs extensively searching his home in midweek. This came after Liverpool thrashed Man United 4-0 in a Premier League tie at Anfield earlier this week. Speaking on the development, Ferdinand said it is a disgrace that any player has to go through such, criticizing those who issued the threats. He also called for punishments to be dished out to those who issued the threats. “It’s a disgrace that any player has to go through that. Yes you can say that he hasn’t been consistent as he was in his first year. But nothing warrants that,” Ferdinand was quoted by Daily Mail as saying. “The people that have done it need to be found and there need to be consequences. “Ralf Rangnick has sat there and thought the captain has not been in the best of form in terms of consistency, so I want to take him out of the firing line a little bit, give someone else an opportunity.” He added, “The fact that they have conceded four goals means they are not defending well enough. And the fact that they surrendered as much as anything was alarming.”
