Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has called for prayers from his followers ahead of his next court appearance. Justice Binta Nyako of an Abuja Federal High Court is expected to rule on Kanu’s application challenging the competence of the treason charges filed against him on April 8, 2022. Kanu is facing charges bordering on treason brought against him by the Federal Government. However, the IPOB leader expressed optimism that he would emerge victorious. The IPOB leader disclosed this during his routine meeting with his legal team at the headquarters of the Department of State Services, DSS, in Abuja. Kanu reaffirmed that he would soon be free. In a statement, Kanu’s Counsel, Ifeanyi Ejiofor said the legal team’s discussion with the IPOB leader centered on the fine-tuning strategy towards handling the outcome of the “anticipated ruling, come Friday, on our application challenging the competence of the charge.” He said: “Onyendu is eminently ready for Friday’s ruling. He is firm in his disposition and strong in his conviction. “Be assured that there will be light at the end of the tunnel. Onyendu’s freedom will happen soon. It is forward ever and backward never! “Onyendu requested millions of his followers, supporters and Ezigbo Umuchineke to remain strong in prayers, particularly as this special day approaches.” Kanu has been in the DSS custody on the orders of Justice Nyako since he was repatriated from Kenya. The IPOB leader was arrested in Kenya and repatriated in June, 2022. Meanwhile, IPOB had rubbished claims that President Muhammadu Buhari ordered Kanu’s release.
