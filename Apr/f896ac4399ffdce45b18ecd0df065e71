Former England star, Ian Wright has slammed Manchester United manager, Ralf Rangnick over his decision to sub off Marcus Rashford during their 1-0 defeat to Everton on Saturday. The Red Devils dismal season continued with another blow as they were beaten 1-0 by relegation-battlers Everton. The Toffees were sitting just one point above the relegation zone going into Saturday’s game but managed to inflict a painful defeat on Ralf Rangnick’s side thanks to Anthony Gordon’s deflected goal. The result was a heavy blow to United’s chances of making the top four and securing Champions League qualification. Wright said he could not believe it when Rangnick decided to replace Rashford with Anthony Elanga in the second half. Arsenal legend Wright told BBC’s Match of the Day, “I couldn’t believe it. “It’s one of those where we always knew he would be up against it with everything he’s done off the field. It gives people fuel to say ‘you should be concentrating on football.” “He’s going through a bad patch of form but it happens. The manager hasn’t worked at Manchester United so it will be interesting to see what they do in the summer.”
