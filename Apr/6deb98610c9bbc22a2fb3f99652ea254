The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has confirmed that all candidates who registered for the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) can begin printing their notification slips from Saturday, April 30. This was announced by Fabian Okoro, the Director of Information Technology Services, via a statement released to JAMB Bulletin. The notification slip is ready for printing, with the 2022 UTME scheduled to hold from Friday, 6th May 2022 to 14th May 2022. The slip will enable candidates to know the venue, date, session and time of their examination. Okoro said, “All candidates are advised to print slips on time so as to know the location of their examination centres, date of their scheduled sessions and time of the examination beforehand especially with the adjustment in examination schedules this year. This would guide them in making necessary arrangements ahead of the exercise as the Board frowns at lateness to its examination, as no excuses would be entertained from any candidates as a stitch in time, saves nine.” He stated further that “Candidates need not visit any CBT centres for the printing of the notification slip as it can be done at any available internet point, be it private or public. To print the slip, candidates are to visit https://www.jamb.gov.ng then click on 2022 UTME slip printing then insert registration number to print.” The slip contains the candidates’ important details like registration number, the centre they are to sit for the examination within their chosen examination town and the expected time to be at the centre.
