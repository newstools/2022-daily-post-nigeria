Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has said that he doesn’t feel sorry for Manchester United manager, Ralf Rangnick at Old Trafford because his job and the Red Devils are huge. Rangnick was appointed Man United’s interim manager for six months following the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer last November. The German will step down for Erik ten Hag at the end of the season. Asked if he felt sorry for Rangnick, Tuchel told Sky Sports before Chelsea’s Premier League tie with Man United on Thursday night: “Not too much! He is coach at Manchester United. “Maybe it does not work out at this moment, in terms of the points and how he wished for it and, maybe, how he deserves it, but I don’t feel sorry because it is a huge job and they are a huge club. “He is in this position and I think it was a lifelong dream for him to work in the Premier League and work for one of the biggest clubs in the world. It is more of an upside than a downside.”
