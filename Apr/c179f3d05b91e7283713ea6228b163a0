Former Chelsea ace, Jason Cundy has blamed goalkeeper, Edouard Mendy for the Real Madrid goal that confirmed the Blues’ exit from the Champions League on Tuesday night. Chelsea could not get the result they hoped for in the quarter-final second leg, with Real Madrid going through to the semi-finals. Trailing 3-1 from the first leg at Stamford Bridge, Thomas Tuchel’s side needed a mountainous effort to come back and reach the semi-finals. The west London side came so close to achieving their dream before Madrid found a way to scrape their way through. Mason Mount, Antonio Rudiger and Timo Werner put the Blues within touching distance of a famous victory. A brilliant goal from Rodrygo pulled the Spanish giants back level on aggregate, before Karim Benzema made it 5-4 in extra-time. Cundy told talkSPORT, “Real Madrid find a way to go through. The tie was lost at Stamford Bridge, that’s where we lost it. “The third goal, the gift that Mendy gave them, ultimately is the goal that cost us. “Benzema scored four goals in the tie, and one of them was an absolute gift [from Mendy].”
