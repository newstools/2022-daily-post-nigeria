Mrs Oriaku Nmadu, the mother of the late gospel singer, Osinachi Nwachukwu, has opened up about the death of her daughter. Nmadu lamented that her daughter went through hell while married to Pastor Peter Nwachukwu. She said Mr Nwachukwu who presented himself as a pastor, maltreated Osinachi when she was alive. The deceased’s mother spoke while addressing members of the Nigeria Association of Women Journalists in Abia State. She recounted how Nwachukwu shut her and other family members out of Osinachi’s life. Nmadu said the singer’s spouse never allowed his late wife to enjoy all that she laboured for. According to Nmadu: “When Nwachukwu came for my daughter’s hand in marriage, he presented himself as a pastor from Anambra State. But shortly after the marriage, Nwachukwu shut the doors to our entire family and completely possessed my daughter. “My daughter went through hell in the hands of Nwachukwu. My daughter had four children and I could not go for omugwo (baby sitting) for any of the children because her husband would not want to see any member of Osinachi’s family.” Osinachi’s death has been linked to Nwachukwu. However, Nwachukwu had said he had no hands in his wife’s death.
