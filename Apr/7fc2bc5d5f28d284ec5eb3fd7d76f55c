Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, has said they can only qualify for the Champions League if they win their last six Premier League fixtures. The Red Devils are battling it out with Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur for the fourth spot. Spurs currently occupy the position, while United and the Gunners are three points behind. Ahead of Tuesday’s trip to Liverpool, Rangnick has called on his players to go all out for three points at Anfield. He said: “It’s up to us. We definitely will travel there tomorrow and try and get three points, this is what it’s all about. It’s about our situation. “After the results, we are still in the race for fourth, but to stay in it we have to win almost every game. “We might be the underdogs for most people but if we raise our level we have a chance. “You can see other teams are dropping points at the weekend. It’s again about being consistent and at the end the team will probably finish fourth that is most committed to that.”
