The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Ebonyi is hoping for a victory at the Appeal Court in Abuja over the defection of Governor David Umahi and his Deputy, Kelechi Igwe. PDP Publicity Secretary, Chika Nwoba spoke in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday. The spokesman reacted to the judgement of an Appeal Court in Enugu, which quashed a suit challenging the defection of the governor and his deputy from PDP to APC. The suit was filed by Sen. Suny Ogbuoji and his running mate, Mbam Ogodo, governorship and deputy governorship candidates of APC in the 2019 election. Nwoba said the PDP has full confidence that it will win at the Appeal Court, Abuja. “The matter at the Appeal Court, Enugu is different from the one at the Appeal Court, Abuja. “Today’s judgment in Enugu is between the APC governorship flag bearer in 2019 and Umahi. “In our own matter, we have confidence and hope to win at the Appeal Court, Abuja”, Nwoba noted.
