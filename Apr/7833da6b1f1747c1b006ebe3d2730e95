Former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi has advised Nigerians ahead of the 2023 presidential elections to ask aspirants their major past achievements before vying for the top political office. Obi, who is also a presidential aspirant, made the call on Monday while meeting with some stakeholders of the main opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. Citing the current security problems and other challenges facing the nation, Obi charged Nigerians to do a thorough background check of the candidates so as not to put the country on another journey of pains and agony. He said, “Anybody who comes here and says to you that he wants to be President, ask, where he was 25 years ago and what he has done, where is he coming from? “Ask questions about his achievements in the past. Where have you worked? Which school did he go to? Let us know how he managed public money that was given to him in the past”. DAILY POST reports that the National leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu, Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike are among those who have declared to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.
