Gospel Singer, Dunsin Oyekan has advised Christians to speak up when going through abuse. Dunsin made this known in a post on his Instagram page while reacting to the death of popular gospel singer, Osinachi Nwachukwu, who died after allegedly suffering domestic violence from her husband. According to Osinachi’s sister, the talented singer died as a result of a cluster of blood in the chest from the kicking she got from her husband, Mr Peter Nwachukwu. Reacting, Dunsin wrote, “Thank God for the life of sister Osinachi and the impact of her ministry which is a tremendous blessing. “We must all learn not to keep things that we are passing through away from people who can help. “Friends, please speak up! It is well.”
