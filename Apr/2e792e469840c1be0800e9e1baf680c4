Following the move by the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, to create the office of Directorate of Politics and Governance ahead of the 2023 elections, the Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, has warn the church over the move. Giwa emphasized that the RCCG’s alleged role in politics in 2015 was still fresh in the minds of Nigerians, from which they had not yet recovered. The Pastor said in a message in Akure, the capital of Ondo State, on Sunday that the RCCG had an ulterior agenda in announcing such a plan just months before the general elections. “On RCCG having a new office called Directorate of Politics and Governance, let me appeal and warn the leadership of the church not to put the country into a coma again. “Nigerians are yet to recover from the bad governance RCCG installed. Its leadership was the brain behind the unfortunate situation Nigerians are currently passing through. So they should not put the country into coma again. “There is no problem with anybody supporting anyone they want to support but the question is, why don’t they have the office years back? “Why did the leadership of the church wait till the 2023 election is around the corner to have such an office? “They have ulterior motives. They know the candidate they want to support but until the candidate declares, we will know what to say anyway. They know exactly what they are doing.”
