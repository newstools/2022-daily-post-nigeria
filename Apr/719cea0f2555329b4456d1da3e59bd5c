Former Manchester United midfielder, Robbie Savage, has advised the club against selling Cristiano Ronaldo this summer. Savage believes Man United must keep hold of Ronaldo this summer, adding that the Portugal international is stuck to his end of the bargain at Old Trafford. Ronaldo, who has scored 22 goals so far this season, rejoined Man United from Juventus last summer. There were expectations among the Old Trafford faithful that he could be the catalyst for the club to return to the top of English football. However, the opposite has occurred as Man United have been woeful all season and will finish the campaign trophyless. “You have got to keep him [Ronaldo], 22 goals this season. Listen, he was brought in to make Manchester United try and win things,” Savage told BTSport. “He’s stuck to his end of the bargain, he’s got 22 goals in a team that is sixth in the Premier League.” He added, “His goals have got them 13 points, his goals got them into the knockout stages of the Champions League. People say he’s part of the problem? These people talk nonsense!”
