A governorship hopeful in Cross River State, Mr. Coco Bassey, has said that if elected as governor of the state, he would majorly focus on security, agriculture and health. In an interview with DAILY POST, Bassey said he also wants to revive the tourism infrastructure where the state has an edge and ensure that their social tension is drastically reduced. “I want to be that young man that will bring back hope to the youths, elders and civil servants because everyone matters to me as long as you are resident in Cross River. “What our state needs now are leaders who keep their promises and are accessible and it will grow. “Cross River is blessed with huge untapped potentials but only needs the right leadership to turn things around and get the right investors both locally and internationally.” He spoke about the debt rate of the state, saying it is quite high but that , if elected, his government will renegotiate it and revive the state’s economy by investing in security. He emphasised that security will boost investors confidence. Bassey, 43, said he cannot be intimidated by the profiles of other PDP aspirants. He frowned at the decision to declare the contest open whereas it was zoned to Cross River South, saying the state was not mature enough to jettison zoning of the governorship position.
