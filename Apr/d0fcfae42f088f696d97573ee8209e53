Paris Saint-Germain has been confirmed Ligue 1 champions despite a 1-1 draw with Lens on Saturday. Mauricio Pochettino’s men only needed to avoid defeat in the game to win the title. Lionel Messi smashed in a stunning long-range effort in the second half. However, PSG was pegged back by the visitors, who levelled through Corentin Jean. The result, however, means they have secured the trophy with four fixtures left. PSG wrestles back the title from Lille who stunned the French top flight in the 2020/2021 campaign. The win was, however, greeted with boos and jeers from the Parc des Princes crowd after a less than convincing performance. PSG has raked up 24 victories in 34 games while also recording just six draws and four defeats.
