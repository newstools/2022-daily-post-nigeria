The Federal Government has confirmed the latest grid collapse which affected some states across Nigeria. A statement on Saturday said it occurred at 1830hrs on April 8th and resulted in power outages in many parts of the nation. Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu, said an investigation into the immediate and remote causes of the recurring grid failure is ongoing. The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), the operator of the national grid, is carrying out the probe. “The process of restoring supply is ongoing with some sections of the national grid already energised and supply restored to consumers”, Aliyu said. The government promised to deliver on reforms and investments, including SCADA, that are critical to improving the capacity and reliability of the grid. The statement notes it is in line with President Muhammadu Buhari’s directives on closing infrastructure deficits in critical sectors of the economy. Also on Saturday, Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) announced the collapse in an update. “Our partners are assessing the extent of the damage to the National Grid and how soon it will be restored, more information will be provided soon”, a tweet reads. Similarly, Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) said the occurrence affected “our franchise areas” (five states). “We apologise for the inconvenience caused and appeal that you bear with us while we await restoration from the TCN (Transmission Company of Nigeria).” Citizens are complaining about the situation, the third in one month, and are demanding that the government fix the incessant shutdown. Many have long relied on power generating sets as an alternative to the epileptic electricity supply in the country.
