The crisis-stricken community of Ibeno and its Yoruba residents have resolved to sheath their swords following the intervention of the Akwa Ibom State Government. The communal crisis which erupted on Tuesday, April 19, 2022, had both parties wounded and a few others reported dead. The state government met with the leaders of the concerned groups, including the Chairman of the Ibeno Local Government Area, High Chief William Mkpah; the representative of the Paramount Ruler of Ibeno, Okutinyang H. Inyang; the Village Heads of the three villages and leaders of Ibeno and (Ilaje) Yoruba fishermen who agreed to write a Memorandum of Understanding on Friday to continue living in peace. The Deputy Governor, Mr Moses Ekpo, disclosed this in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Ekikere Umoh, and made available to journalists in Uyo, the state capital. According to the statement, the Ilaje fishermen and those displaced have agreed to return to their homes as the government has commenced the distribution of relief materials to those affected in the crisis. The statement in parts, “Ibeno and Ilaje (Yoruba) fishermen at the Ibeno Fishing Settlement where hostilities erupted last week, leading to the death of only one person and destruction of property have agreed to return to their homes. “Their leaders have also agreed to end the crises and for their people to continue to live in peace at the Fishing Settlement. The two sides will on Friday this week sign a Memorandum of Understanding.” The Deputy Governor also directed the leadership of the Ibeno Local Government Council to ensure the safe return of those who fled the fishing settlement in the wake of the crises, in order to forestall severe humanitarian crises.
