General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, Pastor Enoch Adeboye has said he does not know if there will be election in 2023 yet. Speaking at the Church’s thanksgiving Service held at RCCG Ebute Meta, Lagos, on Sunday, Adeboye said God has not spoken to him about 2023 election. He said God spoke to him about the 2019 elections more than a year to the election, but He has not spoken to him about 2023 election. The 80-year-old cleric added that God might still speak to him about the 2023 general elections. “As of now, I still don’t know whether or not there will be an election next year, yet. I don’t know because my father has not spoken about it yet. The reason could be in Mathew 6-34. “For your information, if anyone comes to me from any political party, I will pray for them, the general prayer point I pray for them is that Father, let your perfect will for this person be done. “If witches are concerned about the affairs of the country, then Christians too must be concerned and involved,” he said.
