The high cost placed on expression of interest and nomination forms by political parties is unconstitutional. This is according to former Rivers State Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Igo Aguma. Aguma was speaking in Port Harcourt on Friday, while reacting to the cost of expression of interest and nomination forms in the APC. The former House of Representatives member said he would have challenged the action by political parties in court if he was running for any political office. According to him “our laws need to evolve”. “I believe this amount of money being placed on tickets is unconstitutional. “They go against the electoral act; they go against the EFCC act that has even limited the amount of money you can contribute to a person’s campaign, but I’m not running an election, if I was running, I would go to court. I can sacrifice my ambition and go to court.” The former lawmaker, who is now a member of the Peoples Democratic Party, however, berated the APC for fixing the ticket cost at an exorbitant rate. “APC is a party that has lost touch with reality. They are disconnected from their grassroots membership. If not, a party that has brought untold hardship to Nigerians, will be selling forms for state House of Assembly, for N2 million, how many APC members can afford N2 million naira in Rivers State?”
