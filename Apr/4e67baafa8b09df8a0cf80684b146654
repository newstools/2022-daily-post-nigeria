The Federal Government on Thursday, assured families whose relations are being held hostage by terrorists who attacked a Kaduna-bound train last week that it will do everything within its powers to rescue the victims. The abductors of Kaduna-Abuja train passengers had threatened to kill all the victims if the federal government did not negotiate with them. In a video released on Wednesday, the armed men said the Federal Government knows what they were asking for, as they are not interested in receiving any ransom from the families or relatives of their victims. However, the Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi, during a ministerial press briefing on Thursday in Abuja, said the government will do everything possible to release the abducted victims. He, however, noted that details of the engagement with the security agencies cannot be disclosed at this time so as not to jeopardize the operations.
