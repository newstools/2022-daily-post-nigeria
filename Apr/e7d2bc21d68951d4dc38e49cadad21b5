Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has hailed N’Golo Kante as a unique player and a pure joy to watch. Tuchel said this during his pre-match press conference ahead of Chelsea’s UEFA Champions League quarter-final tie with Real Madrid on Wednesday. Kante reached 250 Chelsea appearances at the weekend as the Blues lost 4-1 against Brentford in a Premier League tie at Stamford Bridge. The France World Cup winner has found some of his best form of the season over the last few months, producing commanding displays at home against Lille in the Champions League and Burnley. “It has been 250 times a pure joy to watch him [N’Golo Kante]. Of course, it is pure joy and luck to be his coach because he is a fantastic guy and player,” Tuchel was quoted by Chelsea’s official website as saying. “He is so unique, and I don’t know anybody that doesn’t love him, even friends and family, friends who support other teams, they all love N’Golo Kante. There is a reason for this.”
