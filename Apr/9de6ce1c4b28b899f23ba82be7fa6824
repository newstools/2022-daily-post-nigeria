Col. Abubakar Dangiwa Umar (rtd), former Kaduna State military administrator, has asked the Federal Government to do more to secure immediate release of the victims following the release of photographs of Abuja-Kaduna train passengers kidnapped by terrorists on the 28th March, 2022. Col. Abubakar Dangiwa Umar also appealed to the international community to assist the federal government of Nigeria in the negotiations which will be needed with the terrorists to effect the release of the victims. DAILY POST recall that the terrorists had on Monday night released four photographs showing 62 victims in their captivity, including 18 women, five children and 39 men, including a foreigner. Col. Umar in a statement he issued on Wednesday described the sight of the victims in the photographs in a state of exhaustion and fear, as disturbing. According to him, “Pictures of the hostages abducted in the 28 March Abuja- Kaduna train attack are trending in the social media.” He added that the pictures, to say the least, are most disturbing, particularly as they show exhausted and frightened women and children under the most harrowing conditions. He appealed to the Federal government to do more to secure the immediate release of these innocent victims so that they would return back to their homes. To the international community, particularly the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Col. Dangiwa appealed to them to assist in the negotiations which will be needed to effect that release, praying that may God touch the hearts of the kidnappers to show mercy on these innocent and vulnerable victims.
