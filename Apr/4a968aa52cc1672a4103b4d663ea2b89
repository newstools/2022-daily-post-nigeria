The Federal Capital Territory Police Command has commenced a raid of mountains in the territory in order to free it from the activities of bandits, kidnappers and other criminal elements terrorising the area. The kidnappers, bandits and other criminal elements in the FCT have their enclaves built around the mountains in Abuja, especially in border communities. According to Ben Igwe, the Deputy Commissioner of Police in Charge of Operations, the raid would continue until all criminal elements are chased out of the FCT. The Command, acting on intelligence, raided mountains and destroyed the hideouts of kidnappers in the Kwali Area Council of the FCT, among others to ensure sanity for people to go about in search of their legitimate means of livelihood. The mountains in Yangoje and Old Chukuku in the Kwali Area Council have so far been cleared of criminal hideouts by the police as part of its activities to free the area of criminal elements.
