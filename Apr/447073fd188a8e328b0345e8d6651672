The Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, on Saturday, mourned the death of the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi. Ooni of Ife said Adeyemi’s death was a loss to the entire Oduduwa race worldwide. The monarch said the deceased would be missed for his imprints as a descendant of Oduduwa. Ooni’s remark was contained in a statement by his Director of Media and Public Affairs, Otunba Moses Olafare. He said the late Alaafin dedicated his life to the promotion of Yoruba culture and the advancement of humanity. The statement read, “We have lost a great icon, a great monarch who saw Oyo through civilization and modern development without jettisoning the cultural sacredness of the throne first occupied by Alaafin Oranmiyan The Great. “The late Alaafin is one of the privileged elders who contributed to the growth of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and also saw the country through military and democratic eras with unquantifiable positive inputs. “While Oba Adeyemi would be greatly missed for his indelible imprint as a great descendant of Oduduwa, the Ooni hereby urges the entire House of Oduduwa worldwide to continue to pray for the deceased’s family and Oyo indigenes at this trying time.” Adeyemi joined his ancestors on Friday, at the Afe Babalola University Teaching Hospital, Ado Ekiti. The remains of the Alaafin of Oyo have since been taken to his palace for burial later today.
