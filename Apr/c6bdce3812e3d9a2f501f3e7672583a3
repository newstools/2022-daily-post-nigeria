The All Progressives Congress (APC) will today commence the sale of Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms for various elective positions ahead of the party’s primaries. The sale of forms ought to have commenced last Saturday, but was postponed till today following the inability of the contractor to deliver the forms. Based on this, the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party has directed organising secretaries from the 36 States to collect forms for aspirants vying for the State House of Assembly positions. This was part of the effort by the ruling party to meet up with the schedule of activities and the timetable of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The sale of forms for the aspirants contesting for National Assembly, governorship and presidential tickets would be sold by the National Secretariat at three designated places. The NWC also directed that nomination forms for the State legislature should be sold at the state headquarters. The National Publicity Secretary of the party, Mr. Felix Morka confirmed to newsmen yesterday that the sale of forms will start today. According to him, “We are set to commence sale tomorrow (Tuesday). The guideline for the exercise will soon be released on our platform. While the forms for the State House of Assembly will be sold at the State level nationwide, others will be sold here at the national secretariat.”
