Bandits on Monday killed 11 soldiers and burnt armoured vehicles in an ambush on Birnin Gwari highway, Kaduna State. A source, who spoke to DAILY POST in Kaduna, said terrorists, in their hundreds, ambushed and massacred the soldiers, setting two military Armoured Personnel Carriers (APC) ablaze. The source further disclosed that hundreds of bandits were moving alongside rustled cows when the soldiers suspected that the cows may have been rustled, and engaged them in a fierce battle. “The soldiers thought it was a few bandits and tried to engage them. Though the solder killed some of the bandits, the terrorists overpowered them. The terrorists do not leave their dead behind. They also burnt down two APCs,” he said. A resident of Birnin Gwari, Isa Ahmed said that a military redeployment was sent to the area on Monday morning to evacuate the dead soldiers. He said he counted about 11 corpses of soldiers loaded into a van for evacuation. DAILY POST recalls that the 123km stretch Kaduna-Birnin Gwari highway has been designated as one of the most deadly routes in Northern Nigeria. Onyema Nwachukwu, Brigadier General and Director of Army Public Relations did not pick up his calls and did not respond to a text message sent to him.
