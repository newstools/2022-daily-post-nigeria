Police in Kano State have arrested a 33-year-old man Gaddafi Jibrin, over alleged ATM card fraud. The spokesman of the Command, SP Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawa confirmed the arrest to DAILY POST. He said the suspect was arrested in possession of 22 ATM cards from different banks. Kiyawa explained that the arrest was made after police received reports from a victim that the suspect and his two gang members approached him while seeking assistance to operate an ATM, deceitfully collected and changed his ATM Cards. He said on interrogation, the suspect confessed to the crime and said his gang normally uses a 206 Peugeot vehicle to visit ATM points within the Kano Metropolis. He said the suspect and his syndicate specialize in swapping ATM cards by intimidating customers at ATM points, disguising under the pretext of assisting them to operate the machine. The police spokesman warned citizens to be extra careful and avoid disclosing their ATM PIN to any person. He said the police were on the tail of the other syndicate members to arrest them.
