Sunderland legend, Kevin Phillips has identified Aaron Wan-Bissaka as the first victim of Erik ten Hag’s takeover as the Manchester United manager. Phillips noted that Wan-Bissaka is not good enough to play for the Red Devils United and suggested the right-back would leave the club this summer. The 24-year-old Wan-Bissaka has lost his first team position at Old Trafford this term after a drop-off in performance. The former Crystal Palace defender was an used substitute on Saturday as Manchester United fell 3-1 to Arsenal at the Emirates. He has lost starting place to Diogo Dalot in recent matches, with reports suggesting interim manager Ralf Rangick does not rate the defender. And now Phillips feels Wan-Bissaka does not possess the quality to play for United. Speaking to Football Insider, Phillips said, “Is he [Wan-Bissaka] really up there at that Man United level? “With the new manager coming in, a new chapter for them – I don’t think he’s a player who can really move with them as they go to the next level. “I haven’t seen enough from him to suggest that he’s ready to become one of the great Man United right-backs. “I wouldn’t be surprised if he was a player who gets moved on this summer in order to free up a wage to do business in the transfer window.”
