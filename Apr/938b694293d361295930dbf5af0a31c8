Amaju Pinnick, President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), has given a reason why he prefers foreign coaches to manage the Super Eagles over local ones. Pinnick said foreign coaches come with a different mindset compared to local ones, adding that they cannot be swayed by sentiments. The NFF is presently searching for a new coach to manage the Super Eagles of Nigeria after Augustine Eguavoen stepped down. Recall that Eguavoen resigned as interim coach of the Super Eagles after failing to qualify Nigeria for this year’s FIFA World Cup in Qatar having lost to the Black Stars of Ghana in a playoff last month. “I do not disrespect our indigenous coaches. Most especially those that played in the national teams have paid their dues,” Pinnick told Arise TV. “There are some things that I see that you ordinarily will not see. There are things that I know in my position that you may not know. The reason I advocate for a foreign coach is because they come in with a different mindset. “They can’t be swayed by sentiments. All that they are after is success. This’s why they come with their tactics and methods. It’s not that I do not believe in our coaches, but they need to develop that mindset. We have coaches that are quite competent, but the question is: are they good enough for us for now? I’m a Nigerian and a firm believer in Nigeria but our circumstances are different.”
