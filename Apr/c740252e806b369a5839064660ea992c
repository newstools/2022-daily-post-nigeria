In a bid to ensure a hitch-free Easter celebration, the Kogi State Command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, (NSCDC) has deployed 2000 personnel across the 21 Local Governments of the State. Addressing the officers at the Command headquarters in Lokoja on Friday, the State NSCDC Commandant Sulaiman Mafara admonished them to be more vigilant and ensure that they perform their responsibility of protecting lives and properties with a high sense of professionalism. Mafara directed that the armed personnel should be deployed massively to all the flashpoints within the state and the highways for maximum protection of commuters before, during and after the Easter Celebration. He assured the general public of the Command’s readiness to deal decisively with anyone caught perpetrating crime and criminality n Kogi State. The NSCDC commandant, however, solicited the cooperation of the general public in reporting timely to the Command and other relevant security agencies any situation that may want to undermine the peace of the State and the Easter celebration.
