Manchester City playmaker, Kevin De Bruyne, has admitted that teammate Riyad Mahrez’s late chance to earn an injury-time victory for the Citizen against Liverpool was a “great chance” blown in the Premier League. De Bruyne also said that the Algerian international would be hailed if his gambit had paid off. Mahrez attempted to chip Liverpool goalkeeper, Alisson Becker, with effectively the final attack of the game from Pep Guardiola’s side at the Etihad Stadium, only to miscue his shot and put it well over the target, ensuring both teams played a 2-2 draw. Man City and Liverpool drew, thanks to goals from Kevin De Bruyne, Diogo Jota, Gabriel Jesus and Sadio Mane. “It’s a great chance,” De Bruyne told Sky Sports in his post-match comments. “Riyad chose to chip and if it goes in, it’s a wonderful goal. “[But] today we played very well, I think we had the upper hand. This is the way we need to play the rest of the season.” He added: “It’s similar. I know people said whoever wins gets the title. But it’s too hard. The schedule is too tough for both teams to win every game, but we will try.”
