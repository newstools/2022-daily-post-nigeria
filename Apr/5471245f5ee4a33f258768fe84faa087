The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) is close to appointing former Cameroon head coach, Antonio Conceicao, to take charge of the national team. According to Sporting Life, the NFF has been in negotiations with Conceicao and the talks have been positive. The Portuguese is now set to replace Augustine Eguavoen, who left the role after failing to qualify for the Super Eagles for the 2022 World Cup. Eguavoen was, however, given the role on an interim basis, after Gernot Rohr was sacked last November. NFF top officials reportedly held a meeting on Friday morning and have decided on Conceicao but would need to convince the Sports Minister Sunday Dare. Conceicao guided Cameroon to a third-place finish at the last African Cup of Nations and final place in the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification round. He was fired in February and replaced with Rigobert Song.
