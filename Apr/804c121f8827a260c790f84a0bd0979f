Arsenal legend Ian Wright has snubbed the Gunners and named Tottenham Hotspur as the team that will finish in the Premier League top four this season. Wright made his predictions with regard to the top four battle between his former club and Tottenham in the Premier League. Arsenal have been on the rise so far. However, Mikel Arteta’s side surrendered their fourth position by losing two games this past week. Tottenham, meanwhile, have been in scintillating form, scoring nine goals in their last two games with wins over Newcastle United (5-1) and Aston Villa (4-0), respectively. And Wright believes Antonio Conte’s men will go on to clinch Champions League qualification for next season ahead of Arsenal. Wright spoke on Match of the Day, where he was asked which team he thinks will finish in the Premier League top four this term. He said, “Tottenham – I think especially when you look at how they can score, Arsenal are not scoring.”
