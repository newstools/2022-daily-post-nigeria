Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick has explained why he left captain Harry Maguire on the bench for Saturday’s Premier League clash at Arsenal. Rangnick opted for the central defensive partnership of Raphael Varane and Victor Lindelof for the game. Maguire has been a mainstay in the team this season, missing just five of United’s 33 top-flight games. Rangnick’ss decision comes after Maguire was subjected to a bomb threat, which led to police and sniffer dogs extensively searching his home in midweek. The England international has also faced criticism for his performance in Tuesday’s calamitous 4-0 defeat at Liverpool. “I had to make a decision between the three of them [Lindelof, Varane, Maguire]. Two could only play,” Rangnick told MUTV. “Harry has had a tough week. I decided to give him a rest and play with Rapha Varane and Victor Lindelof,” he said.
