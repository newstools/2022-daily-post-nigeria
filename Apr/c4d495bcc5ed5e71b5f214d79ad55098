The Mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has said that the Ukrainian capital came under bombing on Saturday morning. “The explosions were in Darnytsky district on the outskirts of the city,” he said in a statement, according to CNN. “Rescuers and medics are currently working on the scene. Information about casualties is being clarified.” Some residents have started making their ways back to the capital city after Russia withdrew its troops from the region. Klitschko, a former world boxing champion, called on residents of the capital city to stop returning to Kyiv for now. “I ask you to refrain from this and stay in safer places,” he added. The return of the residents to their homes is seen as too sudden following reports that the withdrawn Russian forces are regrouping in Belarus and could attempt another invasion on the city any time.
