A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun, Jackson Olalekan-Ojo, has noted that the National Secretary of the party, Senator Iyiola Omisore was anointed to hold the position in order to serve a purpose. According to him, Omisore is not generally acceptable but is a force to be reckoned with, describing him as a “no-nonsense man”. Jackson, who is also a security expert, said some people, both in the APC and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), have been running around since Omisore was anointed. In an interview with DAILY POST, he said, “immediately Omisore was anointed, there are some people both in APC and PDP, particularly in Osun – some of them their BP is high because they know he’s a no-nonsense man. “Today as far as APC is concerned, Omisore is the most powerful person in APC today as far as the party administration is concerned and you know he’s not somebody that you can push around He had the money you can’t cajole him with money, he doesn’t talk much what he will do is within him. “Senator Iyiola Omisore was anointed to serve a purpose. It is not that Senator Iyiola Omisore is adequately acceptable to the power block generally in APC but he is the person that they know that he is a force to be reckoned with politically.” Speaking further, Jackson said the emergence of Omisore has recorded a 50 percent victory for Governor Gboyega Oyetola in the coming gubernatorial election in Osun State. “I am too sure Omisore will win the entire Ife Ijesa Senatorial District (that is 10 local government areas) for Oyetola. If I am the gubernatorial candidate for PDP, I will just go and resign and leave Oyetola in the post,” he said.
