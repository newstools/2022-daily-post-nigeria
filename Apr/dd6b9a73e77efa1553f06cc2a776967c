Liverpool legend, Jamie Carragher has told the incoming permanent manager of Manchester United, Erik ten Hag to make sacking of Cristiano Ronaldo and Paul Pogba his very first action at the club immediately his appointment is announced. He said the Ajax boss must take ‘a brave decision’ to get rid of Ronaldo and Paul Pogba once he joins Old Trafford. Reports in England suggest that all is now set for Manchester United to announce Ten Hag as the club’s next permanent boss. Carragher is not against United’s decision to appoint the Dutchman, but advised him that Pogba and Ronaldo should have no place in his team. “I don’t think [Ten Hag’s] getting picked for the fact of just what he’s done for Ajax in terms of being successful, because you expect that at Ajax, but what they’ve done in the Champions League, in terms of getting to the semi-final, how they play their football, their performance in the group stage this season. “I think it’s a brave choice because I do think Manchester United now need to start making brave decisions, and some of them about the players as well, in terms of Pogba and Cristiano Ronaldo need to go,” he said.
