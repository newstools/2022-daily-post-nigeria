Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara has urged Muslims to pray for the state, Nigeria and the human race at large as this year’s Ramadan begins today, Saturday across Nigeria and the globe. In a statement late Friday in Ilorin by his spokesman, Rafiu Ajakaye, the governor, congratulated Muslims worldwide on the dawn of another Ramadan fast, describing it as “a new opportunity to get closer to the creator through fasting, alms-giving, and seeking forgiveness. Governor AbdulRazaq, noted that the fasting month is always a lifetime chance for the Muslims to take advantage of God’s abundant mercies to forgive sins and answer prayers in the month in which the Holy Qur’an was revealed and during which the Night of Majesty is witnessed once again. “I join the rest of the Muslim community to thank God Almighty for this one-of-its-kind window of mercies during which prayers are answered like never before and rewards for good deeds are given in manifolds,” the statement further stated. He congratulated the leader of the faith in Kwara State, the Emir of Ilorin Dr. Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari and the entire Muslim community in the state and beyond. “While reflecting on the inimitable words of Allah and rededicating ourselves to Him in this holy month, I appeal to everyone to seize this opportunity to pray for our state, Nigeria, and the human race at large. “Let us also use this opportunity to extend more support to the poor and the silent majority among us in exchange for Allah’s rewards,” the statement added.
