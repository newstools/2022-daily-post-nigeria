Manchester United playmaker, Bruno Fernandes, has admitted he wants the number eight shirt at the club. However, Fernandes has insisted he will not take it from teammate Juan Mata. Mata is the current holder of the shirt, while Fernandes has been forced to don the number 18 since he arrived in January 2020. The Portugal international was asked by a fan on Twitter during a question and answer session as to whether he would change his squad number to eight next season. The 27-year-old replied: “I hope to get it one day…but for now I hope to have my brother @juanmata8 close to me.” There is every chance Fernandes will get the number eight shirt next season, as Mata’s current contract at Old Trafford ends this summer and there has been very little talk of a renewal. In stark contrast, Fernandes has just penned an extension that will see him tied to Old Trafford for at least the next four years.
