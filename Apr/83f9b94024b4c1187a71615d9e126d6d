The All Progressives Congress (APC) has said that the stolen $50,000 at the national Secretariat of the party in Abuja was not proceeds from the sale of forms. The ruling said that as widely advertised and reported in major news outlets, all purchases of forms are payable to designated bank accounts of the party. National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Felix Morka stated this in a statement issued Thursday. He said in any event, the fee for the said forms was set and denominated in Naira not US Dollars. He stressed that the party’s decision to relocate the venue for collection of forms to the International Conference Centre (ICC) was to ease heavy human and vehicular traffic around the Secretariat with teeming aspirants and their supporters thronging the secretariat to collect forms. The party, therefore, urged party members and the general public to disregard any reports or suggestions to the contrary as false and grossly misleading. His words: “Our attention has been drawn to reports in sections of the media regarding lost US Dollars at the National Secretariat of the All Progressives Congress. “On Wednesday, April 27, 2022, a sum of $50,000 was reported lost by an individual around the entrance gate of the National Secretariat of the Party. “To be clear, the lost money does not belong to the Party. The loss is neither connected with proceeds of sale of forms nor with relocation of the venue for the collection of Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms from the secretariat grounds to the International Conference Centre (ICC), as erroneously reported by the media.”
