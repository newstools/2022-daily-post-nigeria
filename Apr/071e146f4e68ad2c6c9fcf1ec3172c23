British superstar racing driver, Lewis Hamilton, has explained why he joined the bid to buy Chelsea Football Club from Roman Abramovich despite being a fan of Arsenal.. The seven-time world champion, alongside Superstar tennis player Serena Williams, will invest up to a combined £20million in Sir Martin Broughton’s bid to buy Chelsea. The UK government’s sanction against Abramovich, following the war between Russia and Ukraine, led to the decision to sell Chelsea to the highest and best bidder. Speaking on Friday, ahead of practice for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, Hamilton confirmed the news, saying: “When I heard about this I thought, ‘Wow’. This is one of the greatest opportunities to be a part of. “This is a team that is all about the community. That’s what really makes a football team, it’s the people in and around it. They’ve been leading in their work in D&I [diversity and inclusion] and becoming more diverse and progressive. “So, it’s not that we associate ourselves with previous owners. Our goal is to continue some of the work that they’ve already done and have even more of an impact and engage more with the community.”
