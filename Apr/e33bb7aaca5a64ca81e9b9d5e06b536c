The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) says the 2022 United Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) will not be rescheduled. Head of Public Affairs and Protocol, Fabian Benjamin gave the hint in a statement on Saturday. The slip for the examination scheduled for Friday May 6 to Saturday May 14 is now available for printing. The spokesman stressed that the 2022 UTME would not be rescheduled “for whatever reason”. Candidates were also reminded that the ban on prohibited items was still in force. These include flash drives, smart watches, calculators, recorders, mobile phones, spy reading glasses, jewellery, etc. Candidates would be checked in with the Biometric Verification Machine (BVM) in line with the “No biometric verification, no examination” policy. Benjamin further advised them to prepare ahead and stay close to their examination venues. “If possible, they should pay a prior visit to their centres before the date of the examination”, he said.
