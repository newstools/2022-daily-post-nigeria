Former Chelsea striker, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has blamed three Chelsea players for their defeat to Arsenal on Wednesday night. He accused Romelu Lukaku, Andreas Christensen and Malang Sarr of letting the team down against Arsenal. The Blues suffered a 4-2 defeat at home to Arsenal, as injuries forced Thomas to play Christensen and Sarr at the back, while Lukaku started ahead of Kai Havertz. Christensen was clearly at fault for Arsenal’s first goal after a poor back pass that allowed Eddie Nketiah to fire pass Edouard Mendy. “It was a really bad performance, really, really bad,” former Chelsea striker Hasselbaink on Premier League Productions “Certain players are getting an opportunity, Lukaku, Sarr, Christensen… “Going back to Lukaku, he doesn’t do enough. “You need to want to suffer, he doesn’t run around, he doesn’t go into gaps, he doesn’t demand the ball off his players, he doesn’t go into space. “There was no passion from Lukaku, and Sarr and Christensen, they cannot make those kinds of mistakes in these kinds of matches.”
