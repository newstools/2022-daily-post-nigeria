Fulham have been promoted to the Premier League ahead of the 2022/2023 season. Aleksander Mitrovic scored twice as they beat Preston North End 3-0 on Tuesday night. The win earned the Cottagers promotion to the top flight for the third time in five seasons. Marco Silva’s side missed the chance to secure their top-flight return on Good Friday as they lost 2-1 at Derby, but the hosts never looked back Fulham can all but guarantee the Championship title, their first since 2000-01, with victory at second-placed Bournemouth on Saturday.
