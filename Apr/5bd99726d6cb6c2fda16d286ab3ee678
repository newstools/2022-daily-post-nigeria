Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, has claimed they have no chance of finishing in the top four. Rangnick stated this after the Red Devils lost 3-1 at the Emirates in Saturday’s early kick-off. The Red Devils came into the game at the Emirates, looking to bounce back from a 4-0 hammering against Liverpool. However, they were two goals down in the first half, thanks to goals from Nuno Tavares and Bukayo Saka, before Cristiano Ronaldo pulled one back. Granit Xhaka’s long range effort settled the thrilling affair between the top-four hopefuls. “After today the top four is gone, yes,” Rangnick said. “There is a lot of work for sure. There is nothing about the attitude of players we can criticise today.”
