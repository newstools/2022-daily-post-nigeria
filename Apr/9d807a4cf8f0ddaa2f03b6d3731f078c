Former Manchester United midfielder Owen Hargreaves has described the club’s performance against Norwich City on Saturday as very poor and crazy. Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick to help the Red Devils overcome Norwich City on Saturday at Old Trafford. The former Real Madrid man netted twice inside 32 minutes but allowed Kieran Dowell and Teemu Pukki to equalise for the visitors He then saved the Red Devils with a brilliant free-kick with 15 minutes remaining. “It was too easy for Norwich at times, it was crazy. “The difference between teams like Man City and Liverpool and teams like United is everyone works, even the attacking players. You see the effort they put in for City and Liverpool. “United had six players out there at the front who took no part in the game defensively. “They cannot play like that at Anfield,” Hargreaves, who also played for Bayern Munich, told Premier League Productions.
