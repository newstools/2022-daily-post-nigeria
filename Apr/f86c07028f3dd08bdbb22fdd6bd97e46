The president of the Nigeria Football Federation, NFF, Amaju Pinnick, has revealed that the federation will appoint a foreign coach in the next ten days to replace Augustine Eguavoen as Super Eagles manager. Recall that the NFF had announced a few days ago that Eguavoen stepped down from his role as interim manager of the Super Eagles following Nigeria’s failure to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar later this year. Nigeria failed to qualify for this year’s World Cup after losing to the Black Stars of Ghana by away goal in the second leg playoff at the MKO Abiola Stadium last month. Speaking on Arise News, Pinnick said: “One thing I can guarantee you is we are getting a foreign coach, within the next seven to ten days, we will announce a foreign coach.” Meanwhile, the Super Eagles of Nigeria are ahead of the Black Stars of Ghana in the latest FIFA world rankings published by the world football governing body last week. The Super Eagles are now the 30th best team in the world. Ghana, meanwhile, is the 60th best team in the world, while the Teranga Lions of Senegal are number one in Africa and now the 20th best team in the world. Behind Senegal are Morocco, the second-best team in Africa, while Nigeria are the third-best team in Africa.
