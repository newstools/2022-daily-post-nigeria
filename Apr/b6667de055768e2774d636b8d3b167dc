Manchester City striker, Gabriel Jesus, has insisted he will not be distracted by speculation regarding his future, amid a link to Arsenal. Reports had earlier emerged that Arsenal reportedly made an approach to sign Jesus from Man City. The Gunners are searching for a new leading striker after selling Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to Barcelona in the January transfer window and have already held talks with move for Jesus’ representatives over a potential summer move to Emirates. Jesus has struggled for playing time this season, starting just 17 times in the Premier League and just once in the Champions League so far Pep Guardiola’s side. However, after scoring four goals in Man City’s Premier League 5-1 win against Watford over the weekend, Jesus is adamant that his only focus is to finish the campaign on a high, starting with their Champions League tie with Real Madrid on Tuesday. Speaking on reports linking him with a summer move to Arsenal, Jesus was quoted by Metro UK as saying: Not time to think about this. “You expect me to say this and it’s true. Now is not the time to think about this, now is the best moment of the season. “I want to enjoy it, keep focused on my teammates to fight for the Premier League. I have won with my teammates three times already so I know how it feels and I want to again. “We have a tough game on Tuesday against Real Madrid, a tough opponent. That is my focus.”
