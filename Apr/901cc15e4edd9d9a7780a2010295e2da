The Osun State Police Command has arrested three suspected ritualists with a human heart in Osogbo/OAU Ife Campus Road, Osun State. The suspects, Olayade Kehinde, 25, Olufemi Oriyomi, 21 and Raimi Sheriff, 21 were arrested last Thursday, April 7 by police detectives on ‘stop and search’ duty. The Command’s spokesperson, SP Yemisi Opalola, in a statement on Friday, said the trio on a motorcycle, were flagged down by Police on ‘Stop and Search’, “but rather than stop, sped off, and were pursued.” The trio, according to the statement, were arrested in Safejo area of Ile-Ife. The human heart, which they claimed was one of their friends, and various criminal charms, were found on them, Opalola stated. Opalola further stated that one of the suspects, Oriyomi fell sick and was taken to hospital for treatment, but unfortunately, died while on admission. His corpse, according to her, has been deposited at the State hospital for autopsy. “The remaining two suspects will be charged to court upon conclusion of investigation,” she said. The Commissioner of Police, CP Olawale Olokode, however, advised parents to monitor their children, and warn them against bad company they might be moving with. He also admonished the youths “to always engage in lawful business, and shun anything that will jeopardize their brighter future, which includes all forms of ‘get rich quick’ syndrome.”
