Two longtime business associates of embattled Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, Eugene Tenenbaum and David Davidovich, have been sanctioned by the UK Government. This has seen up to £10 billion worth of their assets frozen. The government has described the move towards Tenenbaum and Davidovich as the largest asset freeze in UK history. It’s a continuation of Britain targeting people with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is overseeing an invasion of Ukraine. “We are tightening the ratchet on Putin’s war machine and targeting the circle of people closest to the Kremlin. ‘We will keep going with sanctions until Putin fails in Ukraine. “Nothing and no one is off the table,” UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in a statement. Abramovich himself has already been sanctioned by the UK government, leading him to put Chelsea up for sale in a process that is still ongoing.
