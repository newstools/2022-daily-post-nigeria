The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa State has condemned the murder of a chieftain, Sunday Frank-Oputu. The party member was assassinated on Sunday at his residence in Yenagoa, the state capital. In a statement on Thursday, State Publicity Secretary, Doifie Buokoribo said disagreement cannot justify the killing of anyone. “Only God gives life, and since human beings are not God, no one, no matter the level of anger, should take the life of another human person”, he said. The party tasked the police and other security agencies to ensure that the perpetrators are apprehended and brought to book without delay. It condoled the family, prayed to God to comfort them and grant the soul of the late Frank-Oputu rest. “At this stage, no one can say for sure whether the murder was political or not until the police concludes its investigation”, the APC noted. The spokesman added that at the time of his death, Frank-Oputu had no case in court against the party. Buokoribo recalled that after the election of the State Exco, the deceased approached the Bayelsa State High but voluntarily withdrew the case in 2021.
