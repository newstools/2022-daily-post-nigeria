A middle-aged man, Sakiru Famuyiwa, has been accused of stealing two children during the Good Friday service at the Celestial Church of Christ Ijeja area of Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. DAILY POST reports that the suspect was nabbed on Friday following a distress call received by policemen at the Ibara police division. Ogun police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, explained that while the Good Friday service was going on, the suspect and one other now at large, reportedly “sneaked into the children’s department and “stole” two children” aged two and three. According to Oyeyemi, the men were sighted by a vigilant member of the church on their way out with the children. The member, who saw them was said to have raised the alarm, and as a result, the congregants pursued them and apprehended one of them. Upon the distress call, DAILY POST learnt that the DPO of Ibara division, CSP Nasirudeen Oyedele, quickly mobilised his men and moved to the scene where the suspect was rescued from the angry mob, who Oyeyemi said were about to lynch him. He added that the Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, has ordered the transfer of the suspect to the anti-kidnapping unit of the State CIID for discreet investigation. The Commissioner has also ordered that the accomplice must be hunted for and brought to book.
