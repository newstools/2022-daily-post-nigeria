Nigerian duo, Cyriel Dessers and Ademola Lookman are in the race for the UEFA Europa Conference League player of the week award. Feyenoord forward, Dessers has been nominated for the second consecutive matchday after he narrowly missed out to Olympic Marseille’s Dmitri Payet the last time. Lookman, who is on loan at Leicester City from Bundesliga club, RB Leipzig, has been nominated for the first time. They will battle AS Roma’s Lorenzo Pellegrini and Feyenoord winger, Luis Sinisterra for the individual prize. Dessers has been in superlative form for Eredivisie club, Feyenoord in the Europa Conference League this season. The 27-year-old bagged a brace as De club aan de Maas defeated Marseille 3-2 in the first leg of their semi-final first leg clash at the Stadion Feijenoord ‘De Kuip’ – Rotterdam on Thursday night. The striker opened scoring for Arne Slot’s side on 18 minutes and capitalised on Ćaleta-Car’s terrible back pass to score the winning goal after the break. Dessers, who is on loan at Feyenoord from Belgian Pro League outfit Club, Brugge, is now the top scorer in the Europa Conference League with 10 goals. Lookman put up a fine performance in Leicester City’s 1-1 home draw against Serie A side, AS Roma.
