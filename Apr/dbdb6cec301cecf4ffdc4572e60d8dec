Mikel Arteta has picked out three of his players that destroyed Chelsea in the Premier League victory against the Blues on Wednesday. Arsenal went into last night’s game on the back of three defeats, but bounced back to beat Thomas Tuchel’s side 4-2 at Stamford Bridge. Eddie Nketiah scored a brace, while Emile Smith Rowe and Bukoya Saka netted one each to keep their Champions League hopes for next season alive. It was a rare start for Nketiah, with captain Alexandre Lacazette only fit enough for the bench, while Mohamed Elneny and Rob Holding were also handed opportunities to impress. Arteta said he rewarded these players for their efforts in training following a third successive defeat to Southampton last time out, but they turned out to be the reason for their victory last night. Speaking at his post match press conference, the Spaniard said, “when you look at him [Nketiah] in training and how humble and hungry he is, good things happen to good people. If I’m happy for anyone, it is especially him because I know what he has been through. “The same with Elneny and Rob Holding. That is why we won the game today. “I love the spirit of these players. When you lose matches, you get criticised but for these players it is worth it. They are really growing.”
