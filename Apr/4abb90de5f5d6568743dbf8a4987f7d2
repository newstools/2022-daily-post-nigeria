Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa has urged Nigerians to pray earnestly not to have a leader like President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. Giwa, in his Easter message titled, “Christ’s Resurrection, A Source of Hope for Believers”, specifically advised Nigerians not to fall into the hands of selfish politicians again. According to the cleric, 2023 elections should not be what to discuss. Rather, Giwa said the current situation in Nigeria requires all political leaders to come together and organize a referendum with a view to pacifying Nigerians. “Let me use this season to urge Nigerians to pray very hard not to have a leader like President Muhammadu Buhari who will lead the country backwards. “With the current situation in Nigeria, this is not the time to discuss the 2023 elections. It is time for all political leaders to demand a referendum to determine how to solve a series of challenges facing Nigeria. “If Nigerians miss it this time around, they will never get it again if care is not taken. Deceit and dishonesty have taken over the nation’s political space. “When you have a great leader, you can go to any length to support him or her. Nigerian politicians can no longer be trusted. “If not for the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, our faith would have been worthless. Jesus laid down his life for us to live. Without the signs and wonders that Jesus performed on a daily basis, we wouldn’t have believed him. “Nothing to convince Nigerians that the country is moving in the right direction. Hope is a feeling of expectation and desire for a certain thing to happen. There is no sign that can give us hope that something will change for better in Nigeria,” Giwa stated.
