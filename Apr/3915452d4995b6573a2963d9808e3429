The Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, is currently having a meeting with members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, in Abuja. The meeting, which started around 5pm on Monday, may have raised hopes of university students going back to school. It is also part of a last-minute move by the federal government to end the recurring industrial action by ASUU. The union began its latest strike on 14 February before extending it for another two months. Despite criticisms on its part, ASUU had been adamant that the strike will linger until the government accede to demands bothering on revitalization funds and discrepancies associated with the Integrated Personnel Payment and Payroll System IPPIS.
