An Osun Magistrate Court sitting in Iree has ordered the remand of two persons at the Ilesa Correctional Center for destroying the posters of Dotun Babayemi, a factional gubernatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Waheed Okunola, aka Omo Ola, and Jimoh Azeez aka Sake, were reported to have been caught while destroying and vandalising posters of Babayemi which was estimated at over N100,000. Okunola and Azeez were said to have been apprehended and handed over to the Divisional Police Office, Iree Division, where they were said to have admitted to committing the offence which prompted the police to arraign them before the magistrate court. Accordingly, Magistrate Olugbenga Oladoke, who frowned at the act, held that it was capable of breaching the public peace. Magistrate Oladoke therefore adjourned hearing on the matter till Tuesday, April 19, 2022, and ordered that the duo be remanded at the Ilesa Correctional Centre till Tuesday, 19th April, 2022.
