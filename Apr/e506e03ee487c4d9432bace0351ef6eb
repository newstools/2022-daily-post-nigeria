Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, is demanding an additional £500 million for the club, according to Sky News. It is believed the three bidders left in the race to buy the club, were informed in the last 48 hours about Abramovich’s request. They have been told the Russian billionaire wants this amount guaranteed to increase the pot that will be handed to charitable causes. This total figure will see the value of Chelsea reaching at least £2.5 billion, with £1bn of that, donated to charities. Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government last month, following his homeland Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February. The 55-year-old had already lined up to sell the club following the invasion, and he still will be able to do so as long as he doesn’t financially benefit from the sale. Chelsea must now operate under a stringent government licence, to ensure Abramovich does not profit from it.
