The Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, has told the Transportation Minister, Chibuike Amaechi, to keep praying because power belongs to God. The Ooni spoke to Amaechi when the Minister paid him a consultation visit at his palace in Ile Ife, Monday. The monarch also wants the APC presidential aspirant to be selfless, and give his best even if it’s going to cost him everything he is. “Power belongs to God, it’s not by your might, it’s not by your power, nor by your doing. In terms of leadership, it is God that gives power,” the monarch told the former Rivers State Governor. “I know you are a fervent and hard believer of God Almighty, anything you do, you pray to God. Don’t relent, do not relent, keep praying to God. “Leadership is stewardship. You’ve been to different leadership positions from different strata. In terms of governance, you’ve seen it all. But the one that you’re trying to aspire to now, by the very special grace of God, it’s God that will take you there. “We are paying for you from the throne of Oduduwa. On this throne of our ancestors God will continue to guide you, God will continue to see you through, God will continue to favour you, honour you and put you through in everything you do…”
