Ahead of the 2022 Easter celebration, the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has warned Nigerians not to travel at night. This was contained in a statement made available to DAILY POST by the spokesperson of the FRSC in Ogun State, Florence Okpe, on Tuesday. While announcing that the FRSC has set up the Easter special patrol operation in Ogun, Okpe urged motorists to imbibe the theme of this year’s Special Patrol Operations that says, “Avoid Night Travel, Maintain Safe Speed and Enjoy Quality Road Experience.” According to her, the special patrol operation would pay attention to excessive speed, wrongful overtaking, dangerous driving, lane indiscipline; seat belt violation, use of phone while driving, overloading violation, tyre violation and other road violations. She revealed that 1,500 regular and Special Marshals have been deployed to oversee traffic activities on highways across Ogun. Okpe added that the Ogun FRSC Command has also embarked on aggressive motor park public enlightenment campaigns across the state. Motorists are advised to be extra careful and plan their journeys properly, with their vehicles routinely serviced. While urging them to drive at 50km per hour in construction areas, where overtaking is prohibited, she appealed to them to drive responsibly and obey traffic rules to arrive home safely to celebrate with their loved ones. Meanwhile, the Ogun FRSC has warned that any motorist who is apprehended for flouting any traffic rules “may be treated as driving dangerously and could be prosecuted.” Recall that the Federal Government has announced Friday, April 15 and Monday, April 18 as public holidays for the Easter celebration.
