Former Aide to Ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri, on Thursday shared a video of the Nigerian military intercepting a vehicle loading supplies allegedly meant for bandits. The vehicle, in the video, loads food supplies, cartons and bags allegedly containing money being taken to bandits. The location where the video was shot is yet unknown.
