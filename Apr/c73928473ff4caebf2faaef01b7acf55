A former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri has called for action to be taken against controversial Sheikh Abubakar Gumi following the suspension of the Chief Imam of Apo Jumat Mosque, Abuja, Sheikh Nuru Khalid. Sheikh Gumi is an influential Islamic cleric who had consistently defended the bandits in Northern Nigeria. DAILY POST reports that Khalid was suspended by the Mosque Steering Committee for criticizing the government of President Muhammadu Buhari over the recent attacks and killing of innocent Nigerians by terrorists in Kaduna State, especially the bombing of the Abuja-Kaduna train. Speaking to his congregation, the Imam had said, “They [terrorists] can dispatch information…they can dispatch intelligence information as if they are the government of their own, while our government cannot hear intelligence information and stop the rubbish on our ways.” Omokri condemned the development, insisting that something should be done to Sheikh Gumi, who he claimed was the Public Relations Officer of the terrorists. Omokri tweeted on Sunday, “The chief Imam of Apo Jumat Mosque, Abuja, Sheikh Nuru Khalid, has been suspended for criticizing Buhari over the Abuja-Kaduna train bombing. “Yet, nothing has been done to the terrorists or Sheikh Gumi, their Public Relations Officer! They punish critics and victims.”
