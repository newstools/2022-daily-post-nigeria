Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has said he is not 100% sure Ajax boss, Erik Ten Hag will succeed at Manchester United. According to Guardiola, no manager is guaranteed to bring success. However, the Spaniard has hailed the record of Ten Hag, who he worked with for two years at Bayern Munich. The Dutchman coached the second team and Guardiola says his quality has always been clear. “If I was 100% sure I would call Manchester United and tell those guys you have to take him. But I don’t know and nobody knows,” Guardiola said when asked if Ten Hag would be a success in the Premier League. “He is a good manager, there’s no doubt about it. But so were all the previous managers since Sir Alex Ferguson left. “You cannot say David Moyes is not a good football manager and the others like Jose Mourinho or right now. All the managers that have been at United are excellent.”
