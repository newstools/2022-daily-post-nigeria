Mother of gospel singer Osinachi Nwachukwu has made some revelations about the singer’s marriage. Osinachi’s mother, speaking with BBC Igbo, said that Peter Nwachukwu, the deceased’s husband, allegedly threatened that his late wife would only leave the marriage in death. She revealed that Osinachi left her marriage for over a year, and only returned after her husband came with pastors to beg. She also mentioned that she could not see her grandchildren for eight years and was never allowed to come for Omugwo (traditional Igbo custom for postpartum care by the woman’s mother) when they were born. According to her, Osinachi’s husband never allowed her family into their house until some pastors intervened. The deceased mother added that she told Osinachi severally to leave the marriage but she insisted on staying, insisting that the Bible frowns at divorce. She denied claims by Peter about the singer’s health, adding that before her daughter died, she and her husband went for medical checkup and were told by experts that nothing was wrong with her. Meanwhile, Osinachi’s husband has since been arrested by the FCT Police Command.
