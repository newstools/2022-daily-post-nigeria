A 19-year-old apprentice, Babatunde Bobola, has been remanded in the Akure Correctional Centre by an Akure Magistrate Court for allegedly raping an eight-year-old girl. The defendant was charged with rape by men from the Ondo State Security Network Agency, called Amotekun Corps. The defendant committed the offence on March 24, 2021, at Odige Street, according to the State Prosecutor, O.F Akeredolu. Akeredolu claimed that the defendant had carnal knowledge of an eight-year-old girl. The charge read “That you, Babatunde Bobola, did have carnal knowledge of an eight-year-old girl on or about March 24, 2022, at approximately 16:00 hours, at Odige Street, Akure, a place within the criminal jurisdiction of this Honourable Court.” Sections 357 and 358 of the Criminal Code Law, Cap. 37, Vol. 1, Laws of Ondo State of Nigeria, 2006, according to the prosecutor, were violated. Given the severity of the defendant’s crime, Akeredolu requested that the suspect be remanded in custody at the Correctional Centre, which was backed by an affidavit. The defendant’s plea was not accepted due to a lack of jurisdiction. The defendant was remanded in the Olokuta Correctional Centre by Magistrate N.K. Aladejana pending legal advice from the Department of Public Prosecution, DPP. The matter was adjourned until June 13, 2022, for further mention.
