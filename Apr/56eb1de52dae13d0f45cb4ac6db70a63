The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has said the only authority vested with the power to authenticate Party membership cards for eligibility to participate in Congresses, including the 3-man Ad-Hoc Delegate Congresses, are the National Chairman and the National Secretary through their signatures on the cards. Debo Ologunagba, National Publicity Secretary of the party in a statement on Saturday, said the clarification become necessary, following reports of misinterpretation in some chapters, particularly in Lagos State, where some party stakeholders are reportedly demanding that membership cards be authenticated by Ward Chairmen before the holders are eligible to participate in the 3-man Ad-Hoc Congresses. Ologunagba said the PDP Constitution of 2017 (as amended) in Chapter 2, Part 1, Article 8(7) is clear in providing that “the membership card shall be produced by the National Headquarters and authenticated by the National Chairman and the National Secretary. “For emphasis, members holding Membership Cards duly authenticated by the National Chairman and National Secretary do not require any further authentication by Ward Chairmen or any other officer of the Party at any level whatsoever before they can participate in the 3-man Ad-hoc Delegate Congresses and Party Primaries.” The statement said He said a member with a duly authenticated card by the National Chairman and National Secretary and who is up to date in his financial obligation to the party shall be eligible to participate and vote in the 3-man Ad-Hoc Delegate Congress. He urged all party leaders, critical stakeholders and members to take note accordingly
