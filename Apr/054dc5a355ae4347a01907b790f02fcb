Kidnappers of Kaduna-Abuja bombed train passengers, on Monday, released another video, threatening to kill all the victims. They are accusing the government of refusing to negotiate with them. DAILY POST recalls that the bandits had last week released a video, showing three bandits, with the Managing Director of Bank of Agriculture, whom they said would be released for the sake of the Ramadan fasting. In the latest 5 minutes video, eight armed bandits were seen standing behind over 100 abducted train passengers, all seated. One of the bandits was heard asking the victims, their names, their occupation and what they do for a living. It’s not certain what would happen to the victims after the interview, as a lady who introduced herself as a student of the Kaduna State University was seeing shivering.
