Former Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki and the Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Emmanuel have said the processes leading to the 2023 elections will determine Nigeria’s progress. The presidential aspirants made the assertions on the same day at different times when they called on PDP stakeholders and delegates ahead of party primaries. Earlier, Governor Emmanuel said depending on the choice of candidates by delegates, those elected can make or mar the existence of the country, insisting electioneering processes will determine Nigeria’s next direction. “Next year’s general election is very critical to the well being of Nigeria. The elections will redefine whether the country will move forward or not. “This will depend much on the types of politicians elected into power.” He expressed worry that the country was going down swiftly in the areas of security, economy and infrastructure. “Somebody must rise to redeem and restore the country. I, therefore, offer myself to partner with God to rescue Nigeria”. Addressing the PDP officials and supporters, the former Senate President said Nigeria now needs a president that is bold to take on challenges. He also said next year will be a defining moment for Nigeria because the country has been disunited and insecure. “Nigeria is now a failed state. There is massive insecurity and killings, oil thefts in the South-South, cost of living is too high due to the high exchange rate. “We don’t have the luxury of voting because of religious sentiments, or the luxury of voting on geographical relationships but on the capacity of an individual.” He said to be president, the man should have ideas and creativity and courage, saying Nigeria needs to be revolutionised to take Nigeria to the space she ought to belong.
