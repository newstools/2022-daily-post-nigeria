Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp has played down reports that Mohamed Salah is set to commit his long-term future to the club. Ahead of Tuesday’s Champions League quarterfinal first-leg tie at Benfica, Klopp insisted that negotiations were ongoing. Salah is believed to be close to agreeing a contract which would see him finish his career at Anfield. The Egyptian’s existing contract runs out in June 2023 and the 29-year-old previously said he wants to extend his stay at Liverpool but claimed his future “is not in my hands.” When asked about the situation at a news conference on Monday, Klopp replied: “I’m happy with it because there’s nothing new to say. “It is just good. The decisive parties are talking to each other and that’s all I need.”
