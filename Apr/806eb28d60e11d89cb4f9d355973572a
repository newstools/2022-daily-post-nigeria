An armed robbery suspect, Waheed Ijiyemi, has been arrested in Ogun State with a small bag containing a cut-to-size local pistol and 10 live cartridges. Ijiyemi was arrested on Tuesday “while on his way to carry out robbery operation,” the police has said. Ogun police spokesperson, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said the suspect was nabbed while the DPO of Onipanu division, CSP Bamidele Job, was on routine patrol with his men. The DPO was said to have sighted the suspect on an unregistered Bajaj motorcycle, which he reportedly abandoned and fled the moment he sighted the police team. “Immediately the suspect sighted the policemen, he abandoned the motorcycle and took to his heels. He was hotly chased and arrested,” Oyeyemi stated. According to him, the suspect confessed on interrogation that he was “an armed robber, and that he was on his way to carry out an operation before he was apprehended.” DAILY POST learnt that the Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, has ordered that the suspect be transferred to the state CID for discreet investigation.
