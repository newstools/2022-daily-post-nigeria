Peter Obi, a presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has warned Nigerians of greater consequences ahead of the 2023 election. Obi warned Nigerians to avoid repeating the same mistake they made during the 2015 and 2019 general elections by voting for an incompetent leader in 2023. The former Governor of Anambra State said this while speaking in Lagos during a consultation visit to PDP stakeholders. He warned that Nigeria is going through a very difficult time that must not continue otherwise everyone will pay for it. Obi said: “We all have a responsibility to ensure that we do not make a mistake in 2023 by voting for incompetence. “Nigeria is going through a very difficult time and we must not allow it to continue otherwise all of us we pay for the consequences.” Obi is contending with Bukola Saraki, Atiku Abubakar, Aminu Tambuwal, Dele Momodu, Nyesom Wike and Pius Ayim for PDP’s presidential ticket.
