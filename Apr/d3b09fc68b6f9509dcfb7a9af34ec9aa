The Leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, has listed some of the states that terrorists are planning to attack. Primate Ayodele disclosed that terrorists plan to attack Abuja, Katsina, Zamfara, Plateau, Benue, Imo, and Anambra States. Disclosing this in a statement signed by his media aide, Oluwatosin Osho, the clergyman blamed visa on arrival as a major means of bringing terrorism into the country. Primate Ayodele, however, noted that terrorists’ days are numbered. “There are people behind it that have not been addressed, they will gradually extend it to the other zones in the country, and if this happens, the country will be in a serious mess. At the moment, major facilities are on the list of these terrorists, their days are numbered but they keep regrouping. “Our immigration network should stop giving visa on arrival; it’s one of the ways these terrorists come into the country. They are planning to attack Abuja, Katsina, Zamfara, Plateau, Benue, Imo, and Anambra states. I see suicide bombers on rampage again,” he said. Primate Ayodele warned that the security in shopping malls and international airports be fortified as he foresees possible explosions. “Let the security operatives fortify security in our shopping malls, international airports because of unexpected explosions. Security agencies need God’s intervention and they must work with God’s warnings through his prophets. “I repeat that the spiritual intelligence department is needed to overcome these crisis, to be forewarned is to be forearmed,” he said.
