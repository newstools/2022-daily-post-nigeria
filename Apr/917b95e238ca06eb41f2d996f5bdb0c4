Internal harmony in the Benue State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) continues to blossom, following successes with ongoing zoning of the party’s tickets for the Governorship and other elective positions, ahead of the 2023 general elections. The party in the Tiv speaking area had zoned its Governorship ticket to the Jechira intermediate area and Vandeikya Local Government Area, which reportedly led to disagreement in some quarters of the Kwande intermediate bloc. But the State Publicity Secretary of the party, Bemgba Iortyom, in a statement on Tuesday, said the “issues had been resolved”. According to him: “The leader of the party, His Excellency, Governor Samuel Ortom who has been steering the zoning process engaged with Kwande intermediate area after Jechira was favoured and this culminated today in Kwande pledging its acceptance of the decision of the party to favour Jechira at this stage of the zoning of the governorship ticket. “Kwande also pledged its unalloyed support to the party’s drive to win the 2023 general elections in the state and also contribute strongly towards recapturing power at the national level. “Benue PDP commends the untiring efforts of its leader, Governor Samuel Ortom, who together with National Chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, State Chairman, Sir John Ngbede and the State Executive Committee, Senators Gabriel Suswam, Emmanuel Yisa Orker Jev and Patrick Abba Moro, as well as members of House of Representatives, the State Assembly and stakeholders, have worked to keep the party on track and united while zoning of tickets for the various elections across the state is ongoing. “The party equally commends stakeholders and PDP faithful in Kwande Intermediate area for their large-heartedness in placing the party’s interests above those of their area by their acceptance of the zoning decision. “The party adopts wholly the words of Governor Ortom which he reiterated even today that “PDP remains the only hope for the ordinary Nigerian who is looking up to the party to salvage the nation and save her democracy from the ravages of APC misrule such as threatens the very soul of the country at the moment”. “It is the pledge of PDP in Benue State that all segments of the state will be fairly considered in the ongoing zoning of tickets to elective positions, as this remains the tradition which has kept the party growing in strength and success from one election year to another since its founding in 1998,” Iortyom added.
