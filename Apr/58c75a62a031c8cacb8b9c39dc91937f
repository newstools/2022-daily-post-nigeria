Trailer drivers on Saturday blocked the Kaduna-Abuja road, protesting alleged harassment by soldiers manning various points of the highway. A source told DAILY POST in Kaduna that the blockade took place around Sabon Gaya village, about 7km to Kaduna town. Senator Shehu Sani had tweeted about the incident: “Trailer drivers blocked Kaduna-Abuja highway now. Many are stranded for whatever reason they did that the issue should be resolved knowing security implications of gathering such number of people in one place.” The Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) Sector Commander, Hafiz Mohammed, said his officers, alongside policemen, are trying to clear the road. According to him, “the road is blocked, and you know most people in this country are lawless; so we are here trying to clear the road which may take time.”
