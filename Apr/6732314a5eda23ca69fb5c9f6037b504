Former England goalkeeper, Paul Robinson has labelled as ‘strange’ Thomas Tuchel’s decision to move Reece James to centre-back from his full-back position. James has primarily operated as a right wing-back both for England and Chelsea. But during the Blues’ 2-0 FA Cup semi-final win over Crystal Palace on Sunday, Chelsea boss, Tuchel deployed him to the centre-back position, pairing him with Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen. And Robinson called on Tuchel to reinstate the 22-year-old’s to his natural position. Speaking to Football Insider, he said: “It is a strange one because he[James] gives you so much going forward. “What he gives you in regards to his delivery, dribbling and range of passing far outweighs what you get from him at centre-half. ‘The only rationale I can think of is that Tuchel possibly doesn’t think Azpilicueta is physical enough to be a centre-half in that game. “There was going to be an aerial threat from Palace and maybe Tuchel took that into consideration.” The west London side will face their north London rivals in a Premier League clash on Tuesday and Thomas Tuchel’s side will look to maintain their fine run in the league. While Arsenal have struggled in recent weeks, losing three straight matches, Chelsea have returned to form, beating Southampton 6-0 in the PremierLeague, Real Madrid 3-2 in the Champions League and Crystal Palace 2-0 in the FA Cup. A loss to Chelsea on Wednesday would be heavy for Mikel Arteta’s side chances of finishing top four and qualifying for the Champions League next season.
