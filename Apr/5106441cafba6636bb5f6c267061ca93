The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has insisted the general election in 2023 will hold as planned, despite the insecurity in the country. Chairman of the electoral body, Mahmood Yakubu, stated this at a public presentation in Abuja on Thursday. Yakubu also noted that next year’s polls will be governed by the new electoral act. “Clearly, these are challenging times but we are determined that election must hold in 2023. “However, this is a shared responsibility. INEC plays a critical role but the commission alone cannot deliver the elections we all desire. “I, therefore, appeal to all Nigerians to join hands with us in ensuring that we make a success of the process,” Yakubu said.
