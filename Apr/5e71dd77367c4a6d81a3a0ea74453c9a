United Nations’ Secretary-General, António Guterres, on Wednesday, said that the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine will end when the Russian Federation decides to end it and when there is – after a ceasefire – a possibility of a serious political agreement. Guterres said this on Wednesday during an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper. He noted that meetings would not end the war between Russia and Ukraine. “The war will not end with meetings. “The war will end when the Russian Federation decides to end it and when there is – after a ceasefire – a possibility of a serious political agreement. We can have all the meetings but that is not what will end the war,” Guterres said. Recall that the war between Russia and Ukraine started in February and several casualties have already been recorded as a result of the war. Guterres had on Tuesday traveled to Moscow for a one-on-one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss “proposals for humanitarian assistance and the evacuation of civilians” from conflict zones, namely the besieged city of Mariupol. As a result, Putin agreed “in principle” to allow the UN and the International Committee for the Red Cross to assist in the evacuation of citizens from the Azovstal plant in Mariupol, the last bastion of Ukrainian defense in the city.
