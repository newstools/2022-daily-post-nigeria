Two men, Umar Usman and Muhammed Ibrahim have been arrested in Ogun State after they attempted to kidnap one Suleiman Muhammed, who is an in-law to Usman. Police said the incident happened at Imeko, in the Imeko-Afon Local Government Area of the State. In a telephone conversation, the suspects were reported to have disguised themselves and demanded a sum of N5million from Suleiman in order to avert being kidnapped. Ogun State police image maker, Abimbola Oyeyemi, told newsmen that the arrest of the suspects followed a report lodged at the Imeko Police Division by the victim. According to the PPRO, Suleiman had told the police that he was threatened by Usman, who hid his phone number to inform him of possible abduction if he failed to provide N5million. “The victim said the caller threatened to get him kidnapped if he failed to pay N5m within a week. “The caller also urged him to go and sell all his cows in order to raise the money within the stipulated time,” Oyeyemi confirmed. DAILY POST learnt that Usman, the first suspect, is married to the sister of the victim; he was said to have informed others about how wealthy the brother-in-law is. Oyeyemi stated that the suspects confessed to knowing their victim, adding that they “decided to kidnap the man in order to make money from him because if they asked him for financial assistance, he would not do it.”
