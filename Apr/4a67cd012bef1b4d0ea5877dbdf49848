Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel has said the uncertainty surrounding the club’s ownership is giving their rivals an early advantage in the summer transfer market. Blues’ owner, Roman Abramovich, has been sanctioned by the UK government and the Premier League outfit is in the process of being sold. Under the terms of a special licence allowing the club to function, Chelsea are banned from signing players or agreeing contract extensions with existing members of their squad. This has led to Antonio Rudiger’s decision to leave Stamford Bridge on a free transfer. Andreas Christensen is also in advanced talks to join Barcelona when his contract runs out in June. As it stands, Chelsea cannot approach possible replacements or look to strengthen their squad in other areas at a time when many others are beginning to take steps in the market. “[In a normal season], you are never fully sure but we would have some targets and we would have for sure contacted some players and found out about their situations. “Of course, now our hands are tied. We can still have talks inside the building but we cannot act. The situation is not ideal,” Tuchel said.
