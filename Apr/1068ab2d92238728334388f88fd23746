Legendary Manchester United boss, Sir Alex Ferguson, has sent his best wishes to the club’s new permanent manager, Erik ten Hag. Ferguson has told the Dutchman to “get in control” of the failing club. Ten Hag was last week confirmed as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s replacement on a three-year deal with an option to extend that for a further 12 months. He will become the fifth permanent successor to Ferguson since the legendary Scot retired at the end of the 2012/13 season. United have failed to win the Premier League title since Sir Alex’s retirement, with their last silverware coming in 2017 with the Europa League. Ferguson, appearing on RTE Racing, was asked if Ten Hag could be the man to turn United’s fortunes around, he replied: “I hope he does well, the club needs someone to get in control and I hope he does well.”
