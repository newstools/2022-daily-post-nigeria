Former governor of Anambra State and Presidential aspirant in the 2023 general election, Mr. Peter Obi has said Nigerians cannot continue to live in mutual suspicion. He said such situation had denied the nation of having best hands in governance. He preached love among the citizens, irrespective of religious and political background, saying that was the only way the nation can develop. Obi, who is seeking to contest the presidential election on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2023, spoke at while inaugurating Peter Obi Support Network, (POSN) National and Zonal Coordinators in Abuja on Monday. He added that mistrust among the elite and the political class was the bane of the nation’s lack of good leadership which was also responsible for the lack of development. He said, “we can’t continue to live in mutual suspicion of each other in this country; we must love each other; we must build a country where everybody is treated fairly, equally and justly. “There is nothing to share again, let’s start taking people out of poverty, once you are able to take people out of poverty, you can go home and rest.”
