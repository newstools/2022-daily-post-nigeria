Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva has cautioned those seeking war in Nigeria. He urged citizens to offer support for the success of the President Muhammadu Buhari led-administration. The former Bayelsa governor made the call on Saturday in Abuja in his Easter message. Sylva acknowledged the challenges in the country, noting that violence and hate speeches would not solve problems. He said apportioning blames could aggravate the situation which required “collective support and prayers”. The minister assured that the Buhari administration was doing its best in dealing with the security and economic issues. “Those beating the drum of war should desist from it because we have no other country but Nigeria,” he said. “We thank Nigerians for their patience and understanding during the last fuel scarcity.” Sylva added that measures are being put in place to ensure petroleum products are available at all times.
