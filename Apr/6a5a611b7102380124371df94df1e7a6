Former Manchester United striker, Diego Forlan, has told the club not to relent in their effort to sign Benfica starlet, Darwin Nunez. According to Forlan, Nunez will thrive at Old Trafford as United are looking to prioritise the signing of a young forward this summer. Reports in England suggest that Nunez, 22, is Manchester United’s target, having scored 32 goals in all competitions for Benfica this season. Chelsea and Arsenal have also shown interests in the Uruguay international, but Forlan believes his countryman could be an ideal fit at United. “He is a young, guy, a very strong guy scoring a lot of goals and doing very well at Benfica,” Forlan told Beyond the Pitch. “He has had a really good Champions League season and in the Portuguese league. “He has a lot of potential, he is very young, he is improving season by season and if he has the opportunity to go to Man Utd, it would be really good for him and for the club. “Maybe he will come to United and adapt immediately.” Manchester United’s incoming boss, Erik ten Hag has already reportedly told Cristiano Ronaldo he would not be needed at Old Trafford any longer. Also Edinson Cavani, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, who are the other striking options, are all said to be ready to leave the club as they look forward to overhaul.
