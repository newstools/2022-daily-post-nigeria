Former Nigeria captain, Austin ‘Jay Jay’ Okocha, has claimed there will be refereeing errors at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Okocha also hit out at Algeria head coach, Djamel Belmadi, for publicly criticising referee Bakary Papa Gassama for “poor officiating” in the 2-1 second leg of their playoff against Cameroon. The North Africans won the first leg 1-0 and came into the reverse fixture as favourites. However, the Indomitable Lions produced a spirited performance to advance on the away goal rule. “A coach has no right to talk about the mistakes of a referee. There is a structure capable of seeing better than us and sanctioning. The VAR has challenged the referee, which means that there is a fault. What are we talking about here? Where is the referee’s error?” Okocha asked, as quoted by L-Frii. “We all watched that same game. We saw the offsides, the heads accompanied by the hands. Maradona called it the hand of God. Nowadays, the VAR is the laser that sanctions.” Okocha went on to opine there will be mistakes at the World Cup in Qatar too. “Cameroon is qualified, that’s all! If we have to talk about refereeing errors, now is not the time. A country has just lost a match on the field; then suddenly, a coach comes to worsen the thing,” the now 48-year-old continued. “Organize a symposium and debate on all the things that undermine African football, but not at the dawn of the competitions! “The real mistakes made on purpose await you at the World Cup in Qatar; where will you file your complaints?”
