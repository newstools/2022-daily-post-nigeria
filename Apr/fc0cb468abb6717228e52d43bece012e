Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has debunked rumors that he is currently being treated in a German hospital. The claim, which had been making the rounds in the state, was described as “wicked” and “misleading” by Akeredolu, who said that the falsehood was circulated by “disgruntled politicians.” The governor, speaking through his Chief Press Secretary, Richard Olatunde, said he had sent a letter to the state House of Assembly that he would be gone for 14 days as part of his 2022 Annual Leave. In the statement, it was also revealed that between March 28 and March 31st, 2022, Akeredolu and his colleagues departed Nigeria for Dubai to attend the largest Annual Investment Meeting in the United Arab Emirates. The statement partly read “In clear terms, Governor Akeredolu is not hospitalized anywhere. “These are mere wishes of failed politicians who now carry the burden of uncanny distrust and embedded treachery. “We won’t even wish them their evil imaginations. “Although, giving Sahara Reporters’ antecedent and stock in trade, we are not amazed at this fabricated and outright falsehood which is being spread by cronies of some disgruntled politicians in their renewed efforts at plastering battered political misadventures. It was also disclosed that Akeredolu had transferred power to his deputy, Lucky Aiyedatiwa to perform the functions of his office during the leave.
