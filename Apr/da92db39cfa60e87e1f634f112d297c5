Popular cross-dresser, James Brown has reacted to a move by the House of Representatives to prohibit cross-dressing in Nigeria. DAILY POST had reported that Umar Muda, a member of the House of Representatives had last week introduced a bill to prohibit cross-dressing in Nigeria. The bill seeks to ban cross-dressing with the exemption of those using it for entertainment. With this proposed law, crossdressers now risk 6 months in prison if passed. The bill also seeks to amend the same-sex marriage (prohibition) act of 2013 by including cross-dressing as one of the offences under the act. Reacting, James Brown on his Instagram, said he is a drag queen. ”Point of correction, I am NOT a crossdresser. I am a DRAG Queen. Do your research before you come for me. My job is to entertain using my personality and my beauty, you already know the vibes! ”I am a COMEDIAN. You thought I was making you laugh for no reason, I am PRINCESS OF AFRICA, This bill has nothing on me. ”Don’t underestimate the power that I carry. Ask my fans, ask those that know me personally, on a daily, I give you James without all the glam and the feminine touch. ”Abeg efi mi si le, let me enjoy my life. Omo to dun toyin.”
