One trader, Mrs. Nkoyo Ekpenyong, 63, was reportedly bitten by a reptile, suspected to be a snake at the popular Watts Market in Calabar Wednesday evening. DAILY POST learnt that said the snake reportedly emerged from the mountain of wastes stacked on the road, which lies in front of the Atakpa police station. The unsuspecting woman had her wares, which included food items, displayed next to the wastes. A bystander, Philip Akpan, who was buying some stuff nearby, said the snake bit her on the ankle and then proceeded to chase other traders, buyers and bystanders. “The snake had emerged from the heaps of refuse, which were all over the market and other streets.

In the process, it chased away other traders.” At Mbukpa market, the story is the same, as heaps of refuse have also blocked the Mbukpa and Ambo Roads, making market women who sold on the road to vacate. In the last three weeks, there has been a resurgence of wastes piling up all over the once clean city of Calabar. Many streets in Calabar South LGA and major roads have been blocked by the wastes. For over three weeks, a resident, Titus Unwana said government agencies responsible for evacuating them have refused to do so. There are reports that waste contractors have not been paid by the government for over three months. Commissioner for Environment in the state, Mfon Bassey could not be reached for comment. But government sources who refused to be named, said a brother to Governor Ben Ayade was in charge of waste evacuation.
