A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Zamfara State, Senator Kabiru Marafa has provided reasons for his decision to dump the party for the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. DAILY POST reported earlier that former Governor of Zamfara State, Abdul Aziz Yari, Senator Kabiru Garba Mafara and their supporters dumped the APC and immediately switched allegiance to the PDP on Sunday. According to Marafa, the national ruling party was not a home to him. He said the party treated him as an outcast and in manners unjust to him and his teeming supporters. The former federal lawmaker went on to explain that even among his former party, some people fought to make sure they were frustrated out of the party they suffered to build and nurture. He said that the new National Chairman of the ruling party, Senator Abdulahi Adamu, would not do anything different from what the former Caretaker Chairman of the party, Mai Mala Buni, had done. “Politics is about winning elections and everything, so we cannot stay in a house that we are not needed,” Marafa said. “As far as I am concerned, I am a fulfilled person as far as this project APC is called. If there is anything left, I am waiting to see how the architect of this cruelty meted out to the people of Zamfara State, how they are going to fare in politics. “But for now, I am happy, I told them to their faces in Kaduna that they will never benefit out of the machinations they were doing at that time, that is Mai Mala and his co-travellers. And I’m happy that they have lost out and they have lost out disgracefully. “APC is not Islam, it is my religion that I can not leave for whatever reason, but a political party, I can leave and join anyone of my choice,” he said.
