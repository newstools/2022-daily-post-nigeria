Speaking during his pre-match press conference on Wednesday, Tuchel said: “Kova [Kovacic] will be out, Ben Chilwell will be out and Callum [Hudson-Odoi] will be out. “Ton Rudiger was in training yesterday [Tuesday], so was Reece James, we have another training coming and hopefully, they will be fine. “Andreas [Christensen] needs another examination, but hopefully, he will train.
