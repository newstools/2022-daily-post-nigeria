One person has been reportedly shot dead and a military personnel injured following an early morning attack on a Military checkpoint in Ogboinbiri community at a wellhead owned by the Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) at Seibou oil field in Southern Ijaw Local Government area of Bayelsa State. DAILY POST gathered that the shootout, which lasted three hours on Sunday, led to the killing of one of the suspected militants. Sources within the community told DAILY POST that the gunmen stormed the military checkpoint in three boats and shot at the soldiers at about 6am on Sunday. The soldiers, who were on duty and providing security at SPDC, engaged the armed men in a gun battle. According to the source, “The soldiers shot dead one of the boys but one of the soldiers was wounded. The soldier was identified as Job and attached to the 13NA. And his rifle was taken away.” Attempts to get a reaction from the spokesman of the JTF code named Operation Delta Safe, Captain Victor Odukoya, failed as he didn’t pick his calls or respond to text messages sent to him. Military sources, however, confirmed the development, insisting that efforts were ongoing to recover the stolen military rifle and arrest the culprits.
