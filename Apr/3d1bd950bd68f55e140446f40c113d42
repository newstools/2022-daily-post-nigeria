The Minister of Transportation and presidential aspirant on the platform of All Progressives Congress (APC), Rotimi Amaechi, has said no president can rule Nigeria from a hospital bed, telling Nigerians to choose an energetic leader in 2023. Amaechi said this when he met with Governor Dapo Abiodun and APC delegates in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, on Monday evening. The former Rivers State Governor, said many have told him that being energetic is not enough to rule Nigeria effectively. However, he maintained that the next Nigerian president must be energetic as no one presides over a nation from a hospital. Responding, Abiodun saluted his courage for declaring his intention to run for president and wished him well in his presidential ambition.
