Alhaji Musiliu Akinsanya, popularly known as MC Oluomo, has said that his sack as Chairman of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) Lagos council and dissolution of the council’s executive by the National Administrative Council (NAC) is a joke and laughable. DAILY POST had earlier reported that the NURTW on Wednesday sacked Oluomo as the Lagos Chairman. The union said Oluomo was sacked based on the provisions of the union’s constitution. However, reacting to the development, Oluomo said that it is laughable as all the union members in Lagos have pulled out of the national body. He also asked why the NURTW President is acting outside the constitution, adding that the dissolution doesn’t make any sense. “That is part of the maladministration of the President that we talked about in our former briefings; the dissolution doesn’t make any sense. However, people must know that we do not have any problem with the national body but the President,” Oluomo told The Nation. “We will be waiting to see how the person appointed to run the affairs of the union will act. The union has already been suspended. Is the national body saying they are more powerful than the state government? Announcing the sack of people already pulled out of the national body is a joke and laughable.”
