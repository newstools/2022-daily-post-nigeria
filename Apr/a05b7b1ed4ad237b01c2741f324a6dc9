Abidemi Ogunnusi, the widow of the late Deacon Francis Ogunnusi, who slumped and died while preaching at the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA), Onikoko, Abeokuta, has said she was in the church and witnessed how her husband slumped and died at the pulpit. Abidemi, who betrayed emotions while speaking with newsmen in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, told newsmen that she was shocked when her husband slumped on the pulpit while preaching. The mother of four added that she joined a few other pastors to pray for his restoration while he was being taken to hospital. Ogunnusi was reported to have slumped and died while preaching about death on Sunday. Amidst tears, the widow said, “It is a thing of shock, it is an unending film in my life. I prayed we live long to reap the fruits of our labour, but he couldn’t; he did not. It was sudden because we both laboured together. “He was supposed to be reaping the fruits of his labour now that things are getting better for the entire family, this now happened. “It is ‘a season film’, it’s a shock to me and I pray God will take care of me, the children and all the family he left behind.” The 58-year-old Abidemi, who described her husband as loving, caring and generous, noted that there was no sign of sickness or weakness before his sudden death. She said, “My husband, Oluwole Francis Ogunnusi was a very caring, loving husband, with an act of humility. He was open-minded, he was always ready to satisfy others before himself. “There was no strange sign. He was healthy and agile. I haven’t watched the trending clip about my husband’s death, but I was in the church while he was preaching and there was no sign of tiredness or weakness.”
