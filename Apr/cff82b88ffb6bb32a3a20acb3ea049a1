The Management of Peace Mass Transit Limited has reacted to the Enugu High Court judgement which borders on refund of money after payment. The PMT’s reaction was contained in a statement signed by Ifeanyi Enete, the company’s General Manager. It reads in full: “Peace Mass Transit (PMT) Limited, having been made aware of Thursday’s judgement of an Enugu High Court in a civil suit instituted by a customer, is taking immediate steps to address the outcome. While we review the said judgement with our lawyers to come to a decision on the next best line of action, we feel obliged to make the following clarifications, with regards to the way and manner we operate as a service enterprise, viz: As a routine, we make refunds in the event of unforeseen service failure, particularly when it is operationally impossible to fully deliver. In our industry, we have the best record and capacity to move passengers on, and get them to their destinations safely, in the event of a break-down, in the course of a journey. Our longevity so far, and appreciable record of service, have been fully merited coming only from God and loyalty, support and commitment of our core customers who continue to partner with us, making valuable, selfless inputs to how we can serve them better, always. We don’t, and can never take your patronage for granted. However, we don’t rule out the possibility that some overzealous staff down the line, can sometimes constitute obstacles to realisation of our corporate policy of prompt, enjoyable and safer road transport service for our valued customers. We shall continue to train, re- train and reorient them to become better service delivery agents. Meanwhile, we urge the travelling public, particularly our esteemed dedicated customers, to remain calm and continue to support us as we strive to provide them always, with better, safer and affordable travel facilities.”
