Alhaji Falalu Bello has been elected as the National Chairman of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP). He emerged during the Party’s second national convention in Abuja. Other members of the National Working Committee (NWC) elected were Stanley Ezeanyaku, national vice-chairman, South; Comrade Babatunde Ali, national secretary; Hajiya Aisha Dankani, national vice-chairman, North-West; Barr Abduganiyu Muhammed, national vice-chairman, North-East, and Kolade Oluwaseun, national vice-chairman, South-West, among others. Bello, while addressing the crowd of delegates, party chieftains and supporters, reminded them that the country would be in trouble if the party failed to take over power in 2023. He told the delegates that for the party to take over the leadership of the country, they should go on membership drive to get more Nigerians as members of the party. According to him, “Unless we change power, we are in trouble. I am from Kaduna and I cannot go home by air, train or road; that is the situation in the country.” The former chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof Attahiru Jega, in his goodwill message, enjoined the delegates to be up and doing, saying that the Peoples Redemption Party had a unique opportunity to contest and win elections. Prof. Jega expressed regret that Nigerian politics had been populated by those that do not mean well for the people. He called on delegates and members of the party to work hard as that was the only way to bring the “brigandage and selfishness in the polity to an end”.
