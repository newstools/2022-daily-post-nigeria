Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has charged his appointees to actively participate in the forthcoming Local Government election and the PDP ward congresses. The council elections and the ward Congresses have been slated to take place simultaneously on Saturday, April 30th, 2022. Addressing the appointees in Benue, Governor Ortom charged the appointees to go back to their various communities and work in synergy with party leaders to ensure the success of the two exercises. He tasked them to cooperate during the ward Congresses where three ad-hoc delegates are expected to emerge for the successful conduct of the exercise. He explained that the constitution of the PDP encourages zoning and consensus, saying the emergence of Benson Abounu from Benue South and Titus Uba from Benue North-East senatorial district was done transparently involving all the stakeholders from the three zones and will be concluded without any hitch. Governor Ortom appealed to those that would emerge as delegates and other members of the PDP, including aspirants who may have lost out to accept the decision of the party regarding the selection of candidates and work together to ensure that the party comes out victorious in next year’s elections. Secretary to the State Government, SSG, Professor Anthony Ijohor who spoke on behalf of the appointees, expressed appreciation to Governor Ortom for always carrying them along and assured they will abide by his directives.
