Everton manager, Frank Lampard, has refused to criticize Alex Iwobi after his error in the second half led to Jarrod Bowen scoring the game-winning goal in a Premier League 2-1 defeat to West Ham United on Sunday at the London Stadium. West Ham led at halftime, thanks to Cresswell’s 32nd-minute free-kick, but Mason Holgate equalized for Everton through a deflection in the 53rd minute. However, five minutes after the equalizer, Iwobi failed to control a slightly over-hit pass from Keane, allowing Michail Antonio to be put through on goal. Antonio’s effort was saved by Jordan Pickford but Bowen was on hand to tap home the rebound as the match eventually ended in favour of the Hammers. Speaking at his post-match press conference after the game, Lampard refused to dwell on Iwobi’s mistake and chose to praise the Nigeria international. Lampard said: “[Iwobi] played really well and I hope people don’t focus too much on the negative and the mistake because if you focus on that you have to remind yourself that he scored us the winning goal against Newcastle in our last game. “He’s got attributes to be able to play in different positions. I thought his work rate was brilliant, his play against a very strong midfield, West Ham, he gave us a lot by coming into midfield and I thought he did well.”
