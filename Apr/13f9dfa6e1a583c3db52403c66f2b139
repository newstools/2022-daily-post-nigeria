Manchester City star, Phil Foden, has identified one major area Pep Guardiola’s side must improve ahead of their second leg Champions League semi-final tie with Real Madrid next month. Foden said that Man City need to improve on not giving the ball away to Real Madrid because the Los Blancos are going to punish them. The England international scored a goal in Man City’s 4-3 win over Real Madrid in the Champions League first-leg tie on Tuesday night. Speaking to BT Sport after the game, Foden admitted that Man City should have ‘killed’ Real Madrid in the semi-final first-leg at the Etihad, adding that the Premier League champions need to take more chances. “For the fans watching, it was obviously a great game of football,” Foden told BT Sport. “We are playing a side that has won the Champions League many times and if we give the ball away they are going to punish us. It’s something we need to work on in the second leg. The tie is still on. “It was a great game. End to end. We started really well and could have killed them off. In these games, we need to take more chances,” he added.
