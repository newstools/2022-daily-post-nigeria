Hundreds of supporters, including women and youth groups, Friday, stormed the office of former President Goodluck Jonathan in Abuja calling on him to contest for President in 2023. The supporters arrived at the office with a musical band around 8:50 a.m. They lamented that since he left office, hunger, insecurity, unemployment, among others have become the order of the day. The supporters said that both men and women have turned to beggers because of the unfavorable polices of the present administration. Speaking, Ms. Ngozi Okafor said since the former President left in 2015, both men and women have been suffering.  She said, “Since he left the seat, we have been suffering, children are dying, we are tired. We have turned to beggers, women are begging, children are begging. We don’t need Baba Buhari again. Our children are no longer going to school.” The supporters were armed with placards with various inscriptions like, “Goodluck Declare Now; Goodluck we love you come back; Goodluck we want you back; Goodluck Jonathan Nigeria’s destiny is in your hand.”
