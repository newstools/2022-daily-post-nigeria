An Ibadan chief, Oloye Taofeek Adegboyega Adegoke has disclosed that the All Progressives Congress (APC) will wrestle power from the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Oyo State. Adegoke, who doubles as Aare Onibon Balogun of Ibadan land, made this disclosure on Friday. Oyo State is governed by Governor Seyi Makinde who won the election on the platform of the PDP.

Adegoke who is eyeing Oyo South Senatorial district seat on the platform of APC in 2023, explained that APC will be victorious in 2023. The APC chieftain who addressed journalists after obtaining his nomination form insisted that the first step any serious aspirant must take is to obtain the nomination form. He explained further that this will help to separate men from the boys. Adegoke added that Oyo South senatorial district deserved better than what it is getting presently. He enjoined members of the party to come together for candidates of the party to be victorious. Adegoke said, “I know definitely we are going to succeed and be victorious for the benefit of mankind, development of Oyo south, Oyo State and Nigeria in general. “This is the first step any serious aspirant must take, this is where we would separate men from the boys. It is a gradual process and movement is an improvement. “Oyo South deserves better than what we are getting presently. “I want to use this opportunity to implore all the leaders, stakeholders and members of APC to come together for the benefit of the party so that we can win the state in a landmark victory. “Oyo south is the nucleus of Oyo State, it is germane to the state, and I am confident that with my competency, antecedents and experience, I will give Oyo South best representation at the red chamber to improve the fortunes of the district and the state as a whole”.
