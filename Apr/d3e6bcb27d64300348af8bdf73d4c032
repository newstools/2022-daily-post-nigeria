The Minister of Transportation Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi says his reason for running for the office of the president is not to fulfill his personal ambition. Amaechi said his aspiration was borne out of his belief that it is his “modest duty to give what I can in the service of my country”. He made the assertion when he declared his intention to join in the presidential race in Port Harcourt on Saturday. The minister said, “My aspiration is not about fulfilling any personal ambition, I am contesting for the office because I believe it is my modest duty to give what I can in the service of my country.” The minister noted that the country requires a leadership that is equipped with experience in governance if the current effort at solving Nigeria’s problems must be sustained. “To sustain and intensify efforts at solving our national problems, our democracy must ensure the emergence of a leadership that is equipped with experience in governance to ensure stability and continuity. “To sustain our democracy and preserve our unity we need a steady hand and a passion for success in a nation that remains united to pursue prosperity for all Nigerians.” The minister recalled how he defeated the Niger Delta militancy as governor of Rivers State.
