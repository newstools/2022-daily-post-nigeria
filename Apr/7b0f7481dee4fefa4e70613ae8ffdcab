Barely one month after gunmen in their numbers razed the country home of the president-general of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, George Obiozor in Imo State, the criminals have reportedly launched another attack using a petrol bomb. They were reported to have set ablaze the home of the state Commissioner for Labour, Employment and Productivity, Chief Ford Ozumba. The gunmen who invaded the commissioner’s home in the dead of the night of Thursday, according to the villagers, first threw petrol bombs into the expansive compound in Umuhu Okabia Community in Orsu Local Government Area of the state, razing the structure in it. A source close to the community said no life was lost as there was nobody in the house at the time of the incident. Reacting to the incident, on Friday morning, the Commissioner said there was no casualty because none of his relatives was in the house at the time of the attack. The Commissioner said, “We were all in Owerri only to learn this morning that my family house had been burnt down. “The attackers wreaked havoc in the dead of the night. They threw a petrol bomb into the compound. Recall that the homes of Chief Cyprian Okechukwu Akaolisa, Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice and Declan Mbadiwe Emelumba, Commissioner for Information and Strategy had earlier been torched making it the third in Governor Hope Uzidinma’s cabinet. Also recall that DAILY POST had earlier reported how the home of the member representing Orsu Constituency in the state legislature, Ekene Nnodumele was also burnt down last year. However, all efforts made to reach the Police Public Relations Officer, Michael Abattam on the development proved abortive as his number was not available.
