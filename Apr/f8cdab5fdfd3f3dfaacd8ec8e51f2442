Manchester United legend, Gary Neville has said that midfielder, Paul Pogba has played his last game for the Red Devils following his injury against Liverpool on Tuesday. Manchester United was squashed 4-0 by rivals Liverpool at Anfield with Pogba taken off after just 10 minutes with an injury. “That could be Paul Pogba’s last minutes in a Manchester United shirt, if that injury lasts for a few weeks,” Nevile said on Sky Sports. The World Cup winner’s deal at Old Trafford expires in the summer and the Frenchman is yet to make a decision on his future. Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus are interested in signing the 28-year-old from Manchester United. Pogba has struggled for form amid injuries this season and it’s looking increasingly likely he won’t sign a new deal.
