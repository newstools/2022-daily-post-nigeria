The Minister of State for Education, Mr Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba has come under attack over his presidential ambition. Nwajiuba had on Wednesday accepted the All Progressive Congress (APC) expression of interest form to become the President of the country in 2023. Nwajiuba, who accepted the nomination form at a reception hosted by the Project Nigeria Group (PNG) in Abuja on Wednesday, called on the party to place the trust on him as their new symbol of unity, growth and regeneration. Reacting, Deji Adeyanju, convener of Concerned Nigerians, described the Minister as a clown who deceived Nigerians. “The Minister of Education just bought a N100m APC presidential nomination form and ASUU is still on strike. “Today is day 72 since students have been home. These are the clowns that deceived Nigerians with CHANGE in 2015,” he wrote on Twitter.
