Sokoto Governor, Aminu Tambuwal maintains a consensus presidential candidate for the 2023 elections would be healthy for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The hopeful stated that it remained the best option for the leading opposition platform in Nigeria. Tambuwal submitted his nomination and expression of interest form in Abuja on Tuesday, NAN reports. The ex-House of Representatives Speaker is also optimistic that a consensus arrangement would favour him. “Consensus is a good thing. It is healthy for the party. Our prayer is that the consensus will favour me”, his ally, Nicholas Msheliza told reporters. “I am the frontline aspirant. Our thinking, our prayer and hope is that the consensus will go my way.” The Tambuwal camp says the aspirant enjoys acceptability among the PDP family nationwide. Others in the race are ex-Vice President Atiku Abubakar, ex-Senate Presidents Bukola Saraki and Anyim Pius Anyim, Governors Bala Mohammed (Bauchi) and Nyesom Wike (Rivers), and ex-Anambra Governor Peter Obi.
