The Chairman of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ Warri Correspondent Chapel in Delta State, Okies Veeky confirmed his release in a telephone chat with journalists in Warri. Okies thanked God Almighty for safeguarding the life of the Journalist as well as his release from the den of his captors but also did not say if any money was paid as ransom for his release. He said, “That is for the wife of the journalist to say. I cannot categorically say if anything was paid as ransom.” He called on the relevant security agencies to up their games in the fight against insecurity in the state.
