Lamido who made the comments at a program on Channels Television on Sunday, said the party’s ongoing preparations for the 2023 general election are in the interest of national development. He said the quest for support from PDP stakeholders across the country would enhance the party’s image. “In the PDP, everything we do is for the good of Nigeria, not ours. People see the PDP as the only hope in Nigeria today. “We are working to bring what Nigerians will enjoy and will be able to restore mutual love and trust” “For me, before you do anything, you need to restore trust”. “Obviously, in Nigeria today, we do not trust each other. We do not feel comfortable with each other now” Similarly, Sule Lamido recalled the 2015 election, saying that Nigerians lost and not the PDP. “There was a party called the PDP that won elections in 1999, 2003, 2007, 2011 but lost in 2015. So Nigerians know the PDP very well. “We did not lose the election in 2015 or 2019, it was Nigerians who lost the election; it was Nigerians who lost, not us.”
