Roma manager, Jose Mourinho, has backed Inter Milan to win the Serie A title again. According to him, “there are many animals” in the Nerazzurri squad. Inter moved back to the top of the table with a 3-1 win over Mourinho’s men on Saturday. The Roma boss however praised his players for showing “courage” against the champions. “Inter are the best team in Serie A with players great in every aspect. “But with all due respect, there are many ‘animals’ in their squad – in a good way! “We had the courage to play and keep going. I prefer to lose against a team that is stronger than us. If we had faced a mid-table team today, we’d certainly have won. “They are tactically very smart and well-versed. If you create a problem for them, they will find a way around it,” Mourinho told DAZN.
