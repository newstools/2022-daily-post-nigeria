Voters in Osun State have been charged to use the opportunity of the Saturday, July 16, 2022 gubernatorial election to vote out Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Adeolu Adebayo, the gubernatorial candidate of the Action Peoples Party (APP) who gave this charge, said the APC had failed the in the 12 years that it has been steering the affairs of the State. Making this call in Oyan, Odo-Otin Local Government Area of Osun State, Adebayo also disclosed that the populace of the State needed a change in the status quo because the APC government had failed to provide solutions to the problems confronting people of the State. Adebayo, who accused the past and present APC administrations in the State of failing to ameliorate the suffering of the poor masses, assured that a vote for him and his party would right all the wrongs of the previous administrations. “I assure you that my government would right all the wrongs of the previous administrations in the state if elected. “My administration would focus more on the development of the agricultural sector which is capable of improving the economy of the State. “Osun is blessed with valuable economic resources including arable land, tourist centres and mineral resources, which if well developed could transform the state’s economy within a short period of time,” he stated.
