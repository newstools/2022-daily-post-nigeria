The Federal Capital Territory, FCT Police Command says the result of the autopsy conducted on the late Osinachi Nwachukwu to uncover the controversies surrounding her death is out. In a statement issued and made available to DAILY POST on Tuesday, the FCT Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Josephine Adeh said the result is currently with the Director of Public Prosecution for vetting. The command appealed to the general public to remain calm while it follows due processes in demystifying the cause of the popular Nigerian gospel singer’s death. The statement reads in part, “The result of the Autopsy is out and has been forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecution for vetting and possible prosecution. “The Command, therefore, urges members of the public to exercise patience and trust in the process while due diligence is being observed in the pursuit of justice, as updates on the case will be communicated subsequently”. Osinachi, a chorister in Dunamis International Gospel Center, died a few months ago allegedly due to domestic violence with her husband, Peter Nwachukwu. The unfortunate incident which set the country ablaze recently, led to the arrest of the husband who was in the police custody while the autopsy was been conducted
