Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, has urged Christians to use their brain and step aside if they cannot cope with a domestic violence situation in their marriages. Many people have died prematurely as a result of trying to stay in abusive marriages, according to the clergyman. On Sunday, Giwa told his church members in Akure, the capital of Ondo State, that the author of the Malachi in the Bible on divorce in marriage was unknown. According to the pastor, the bible does not instruct Christian women or men to remain in violent marriages, partnerships or relationships He also added that the bible does not, anywhere mention marital vows, stressing that, “There are no wedding vows in the bible, it was initiated by us, not by God. “For two people to be joined together, there should be love, honour and submission. There is no marriage in heaven, and do not be a fool to lose your life untimely. “In Matthew 22:30, our Lord Jesus Christ said at the resurrection day, people would neither marry nor be given in marriage; they would be like angels in heaven. “Why do you want to kill yourself untimely? If you try your best with prayers and patience to keep your marriage and fail to work, step aside and take care of yourself and your children. “Women are not the only ones experiencing domestic violence in marriage, some men also are being molested, tormented and tortured to death. “Domestic violence, however, has no place in a healthy relationship, whether the couple is dating, cohabiting, engaged, or married. “Did Apostle Paul marry? How many wives did our Lord Jesus Christ marry? Please, use your common sense and step aside if you cannot manage a domestic violence situation.”
