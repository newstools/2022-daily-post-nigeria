The wave of insecurity in the south east, especially in Imo and Anambra states, has been linked to the continuous detention of Nnamdi Kanu, the acclaimed leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB. Frontline politician and founder of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, Chekwas Okorie who made the assertion, said President Muhammadu Buhari would be unbundling or putting a stop to the challenges once he can order the immediate release of Kanu from detention. “I wish to seize this opportunity to appeal to President Muhammadu Buhari, the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, to use his special presidential dispensation and prerogatives as enshrined in the constitution of Nigeria to grant Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and other prisoners of conscience release from detention. “This appeal is made with every sense of patriotism and responsibility. I believe strongly that the insecurity in certain sections of Nigeria especially the South-East and South-South will be reduced by a great extent,” he stated during the launch of his book in Abuja. Chekwas also urged the South Eastern stakeholders not to alienate themselves or play the second fiddle in the scheme of politics regarding the country, using their wide spread and geopolitical distribution to determine the affairs of Nigeria, especially as the 2023 polls draws closer. He said using the window of the continuous voters registration exercise by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, would be the greatest favour they would be doing for themselves.
