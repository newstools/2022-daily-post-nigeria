Thugs have allegedly invaded the premises of Liberty Television and Radio stations, located in Jabi District, Abuja, and injured a staff of the outfit, Muhammad Sani Yusuf Nassarawa. A source who spoke to DAILY POST on Friday said the thugs after injuring the journalist, took to their heel but the victim was rushed to an undisclosed hospital for treatment. He said trouble started on Tuesday when the developer who owned a business plaza nearby, invited personnel of the Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB) to remove some kiosks there. “Thugs came back in the early hours of Thursday cutting off flower plants attached to our building, and also poured oil on any available space that one can stay around. “Then around 6pm, they returned when we were about to break our fast, harassing staff members on sight, which led to the injury to one of our colleagues on the head.”He said Efforts by DAILYPOST to get to the property owner were not successful, but a source close to him had alleged that human activities around the stations were affecting the free movement of others. It was learnt that the matter was reported at the Life Camp Police Division in Abuja, but when contacted, the FCT police spokesperson, DSP Josephine Adeh, said she had yet to be briefed about it.
