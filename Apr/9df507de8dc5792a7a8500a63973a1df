Former military Head of State, General Ibrahim Babangida has told former Senate President Bukola Saraki and Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal that those aspiring for the presidency must put the country above other interests in everything they do. Babangida gave the counsel when Saraki, Tambuwal and Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State, paid him a courtesy visit at his Hilltop residence in Minna, Niger State on Thursday. “Your belief in having a better Nigeria featured very prominently. You made my day. What you talked about is Nigeria, Nigeria, Nigeria,” he said. “I want you to keep it up, for the benefit of this country and generations yet unborn,” Babangida said in reaction to the comments from the former Senate President and ex-Governor of Kwara State who led the three-man delegation. “I want you to keep it up, for the benefit of this country and generations yet unborn. What you are doing is good, this is how the country should develop.” Babangida said he would only support candidates who stay focused on ideas that would promote Nigeria at all costs and make it a secure place. Tambuwal, Saraki and Bala Mohammed are among the top members of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, queuing up for the sole presidential ticket of the main opposition party. Top figures such as former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, and Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike have also declared their separate interests to run for the presidency under the PDP.
