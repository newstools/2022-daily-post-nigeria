Villarreal striker Gerard Moreno has slammed Bayern Munich boss, Julian Nagelsmann, for disrespecting the Yellow Submarines after the Champions League quarter-final draw. The striker said that Villarreal had the opportunity to finish Bayern Munich off in the first leg in Spain but made the mistake of not doing so. Most Villarreal players have blamed Nagelsmann for the Bundesliga giants’ defeat in the Champions League quarter-final second leg on Tuesday. Villarreal ended Bayern Munich’s hopes of progressing to the next stage of the Champions League this season after recording a 1-2 on aggregate against the Germans. Moreno noted that it was the German manager’s disrespect that motivated Villarreal to victory. Villarreal sealed a 1-0 victory in the first leg last week and Samuel Chukwueze’s late goal on Tuesday night sealed a 1-1 draw which was enough to secure a semi-final place for Unai Emery’s side. Speaking after the draw was confirmed, Nagelsmann did claim that Bayern could have been put up against a ‘more difficult’ opponent. “They are a very, very misleading rival,” Nagelsmann said. “Naturally, our demand is to go to the semi-finals and on paper there were more difficult rivals…” After Villarreal’s win last night Moreno told Movistar, “The first leg we made the mistake of not finishing the tie, and all these comments serve as motivation for us. “They made the mistake today of not killing us off and we took advantage of that. What this team has done is great.”
