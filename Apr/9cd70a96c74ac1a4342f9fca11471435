The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Adamawa State has rejected the local government election results announced on Sunday. The Adamawa State Independent Electoral Commission (ADSIEC) on Sunday evening released the results of the council election it conducted across the state on Saturday. The results from ADSIEC showed that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) won the election in each of the 21 local government areas of the state. The APC said hours after the results were announced, however, that the results were fabrications of the state electoral body. Publicity Secretary of the APC in the state, Mohammed Abdullahi, told newsmen, “Election did not take place. They should just tell the people that they have generated names of PDP candidates as winners. “Election materials were not distributed. Up till now in some local government areas, our people are guarding the materials. “We are gathering our facts and we will respond accordingly. If they want to be lawless and they are governing the state, we too can choose to be lawless. “They are pushing us to the wall and we are going to react and they will not be happy with our reaction because it will tell on Adamawa government and the state electoral commission.” Against the allegation that the election did not take place, Daily Post reports that although turnout was low and there might have been hitches such as late arrival of materials at some centres, in most parts of the Yola capital city visited on Saturday, the election did take.
