The United States Government has hailed young Nigerians for their originality and creativity. The U.S. made the remark while restating its commitment to promoting the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPR). IPR is a strategic resource for bolstering economic growth in Nigeria, the U.S. Mission said on Tuesday in Lagos. The Mission and the American Business Council hosted the second edition of Intellectual Property (IP) Symposium. The theme for World IP Day 2022 is “Intellectual Property and Youth: Innovating for a Better Future”. Ambassador Mary Beth Leonard said protection of IPR is critical for any economy that wants to foster a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship. Leonard noted that strong IPR would create jobs and open new markets for goods and services. She encouraged stakeholders to shore up Nigeria’s IPR legal framework and lay a solid foundation for youth to drive innovation and engender a more prosperous nation. “A strong system of intellectual property rights assures inventors, industrial designers, musicians, and artists alike that their creative content will be protected and valued. “Nigerian youth are an incredible source of ingenuity and creativity”, the envoy stressed. The symposium featured a plenary session, thematic panel discussions and exhibitions with focus on Nigeria’s entertainment and creative industries.
