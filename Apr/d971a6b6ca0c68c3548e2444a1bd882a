A Nigerian, Adedunmola Gbadegesin, has been extradited to the United States to face criminal charges. The defendant is wanted for alleged wire fraud, romance scam and money laundering. The offences contravene Title 18, US Code, Section 1349 and 1956 (h) and carry a maximum jail term of 20 years. Gbadegesin’s extradition was coordinated by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) after a request from the Attorney General’s office. The action followed a February 11, 2022 Order by Justice D. E. Osiagor of the Federal High Court, Lagos, in Suit No. FHC/L/CS/765/21. The judge granted a request to send the defendant, arrested on September 2, 2021, to the U.S. Gbadegesin is alleged to have defrauded an American lady living in Kentucky of over $148,000. Once in the U.S., he will appear before a United States District Court for the District of New Mexico. Two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering have been filed against him.
