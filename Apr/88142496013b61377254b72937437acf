The Federal Government has clarified that it is not re-naming the entire Lagos National Theatre complex. The complex was built in 1976 to host the 1977 Festival of Arts, popularly known as FESTAC 77. DAILY POST had reported that the federal government announced the renaming of the National Theatre in Iganmu, Lagos. Information Minister, Lai Mohammed said upon completion, the facility under renovation will be known as Lagos Creative and Entertainment Center. But the government on Tuesday said it is merely renaming the complex housing the edifice. Speaking on NTA, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, said the controversy on the re-naming of the National Theatre is just a storm in a teacup. “What we said in Spain was that there are lots of developmental projects going on within the National Theatre complex. “You have the National Theatre fully refurbished and renovated, you also have four hubs each for music, fashion, IT and film. You cannot call all of them National Theatre again. “The entire complex is what will be known as the Lagos Creative and Entertainment Centre, comprising the National Theatre and the four hubs.’’
