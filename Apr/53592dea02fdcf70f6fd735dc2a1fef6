Zamfara State Government has sent 97 clerics to Saudi Arabia on Lesser Hajj to pray against banditry. The government said the decision was part of efforts to restore peace and security in the State and Nigeria. The clerics are to engage in prayer sessions in strategic holy places of worship in the cities of Makkah and Madina. Deputy Governor Hassan Nasiha addressed them before their departure, NAN reports. A cleric, Dr Atiku Balarabe briefed the pilgrims on how best to go about their worship and prayers in Saudi Arabia. Balarabe said they must concentrate on the prayers because millions of people put their trust in them. Recently, the Zamfara government gave more than 200 Cadillac vehicles (2019 model) to traditional rulers. The distribution was widely condemned, with critics questioning the amount spent and the importance of the donation.
