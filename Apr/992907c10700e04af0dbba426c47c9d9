A 77-year-old farmer, Benjamin Babatunde was over the weekend attacked and macheted by suspected herdsmen in Ikakumo Akoko, Akoko North East Local Government Area of Ondo State. He was on his farm when the suspected herders approached him demanding money. But the farmer said he had no money on the farm. According to him, after he did not give them the money they requested “the next thing was that they brought out daggers and macheted me. “They left me in the pool of my blood thinking I was dead”. The victim was said to have rushed to an undisclosed health facility for treatment. The attack was the second one on farmers in the agrarian community in the last month. A middle-aged farmer was also macheted in Ikakumo when they plucked his cashew nuts a few weeks ago. The incident was said to have been reported to the police in Ikare Akoko. Both Area Commander, ACP Muri Agboola, and the Divisional Police Officer, DPO, Ikare- Akoko confirmed the case, disclosing that investigation had commenced to unravel and arrest the culprits.
