Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State has suggested that former President, Goodluck Jonathan, is the only person that can make him step down his Presidential ambition. Mohammed said that out of respect and modesty, he may reconsider his presidential ambition if Jonathan should join the race for the 2023 presidency. He said this when he featured on Channels Television’s Sunday Politics, explaining that his stance was based on respect for Jonathan, who appointed him as the minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) back in 2010. As DAILY POST reported earlier, northern elders met at the home of former military ruler, Ibrahim Babangida and decided on Mohammed and Bukola Saraki as consensus candidates for 2023 presidency after deliberations. “He [Jonathan] is one of those persons I respect most in this country. He is the most respected person I have because I emerged and came to national limelight through him,” Mohammed said. “Certainly, I have come to establish a family relationship with him and to me, he cannot be in the race and I will be in the race, out of respect and modesty. “I have given him enough time and he has urged me to go ahead and I have gone ahead and even gotten another burden now, the mandate of my elders to continue. So, if Jonathan is running, it is a very big problem to me,” he said.
