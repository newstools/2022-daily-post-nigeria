Gboyega Akosile, the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, has bragged that 17 governors elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, APC, showed up on short notice to meet with the party’s National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. Akosile claimed that Tinubu only sent out the invite on Monday morning, but all the governors turned up. According to him, this shows that Tinubu is the frontline and a pathfinder. Akosile tweeted: “The man. The frontline. The pathfinder. “He sent out an invite for a meeting just this morning, fiam, 17 Governors came down!” The meeting took place at Tinubu’s Abuja residence, shortly after Vice President Yemi Osinbajo declared his intention to contest the 2023 presidential election. Osinbajo’s declaration means he will go against Tinubu in the APC presidential primaries. The vice president had also met with the same governors before he declared his presidential ambition.
