Spanish football journalist, Alvaro Montero, has claimed Antonio Rudiger’s move to Real Madrid is a “done deal”. Montero, speaking to Sky Sports, Rudiger was already a Madrid player when he scored against them, during Chelsea’s 3-2 win in the Champions League. He said: “I asked someone inside the club [Real Madrid] yesterday and he started laughing and said, ‘Yes, it’s a done deal’. “Things can change but there is a deal between the player and the club. “I believe when he scored at the Bernabeu [for Chelsea in the Champions League this month] he was already a Real Madrid player. “It was his desire and if nothing strange happens he’s going to play for Real Madrid next season.” Rudiger won five trophies with Chelsea, including last year’s Champions League.
