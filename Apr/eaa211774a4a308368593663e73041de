Paul Scholes has labelled Mikel Arteta a ‘disgrace’ after Arsenal’s 3-1 win over Manchester United on Saturday. Arsenal recorded a back-to-back victory over Chelsea and Manchester United within five days, putting themselves in a good position to finish fourth in the Premier League table. Goals from Nuno Tavares, Bukayo Saka and Granit Xhaka ensured that the Gunners condemned the Red Devils to a second defeat in a row. As the referee Craig Pawson headed to the touchline to review Bukayo Saka’s penalty call, Arteta could be seen remonstrating with the official and urged the home fans to put pressure on the referee Scholes believes Arteta’s actions were out of order and should not be allowed. He said: “I think Arteta is a disgrace there. He shouldn’t be allowed to do that. ‘If you see it again, he actually goes to the crowd to try and influence the referee a little. All the players around them as well. That shouldn’t be allowed.”
