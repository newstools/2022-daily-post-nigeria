The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), on Thursday, said it’s ready to mediate between the Federal Government and the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), to end the ongoing strike. DAILY POST recalls that ASUU had on Monday, February 22, 2022, embarked on a nationwide strike following the Federal Government’s failure to meet their demands. Following the continuous strike by the academic union, Secretary-General, Arewa Consultative Forum, Malam Murtala Aliyu, (Mutawallen Gombe), on Thursday, said the action is crippling academic activities in Nigerian universities, and thought it wise to mediate, considering the uncompromising stands of the two bodies, as to the issues at stake. According to the statement, the frequency of the strike over the last three decades has set the tertiary education sector years behind, affecting the quality of the products. It said the current impasse has lasted too long, a sign that a different approach is needed to resolve “this disagreement of ideas.”
