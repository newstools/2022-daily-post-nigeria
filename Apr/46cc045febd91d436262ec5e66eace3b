The Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, has lashed out at the popular social media app, Facebook, over its censorship of religious views and bible verses. Giwa, who fumed at the development said Mark Zuckerberg’s app has been going overboard with its stance on some posts. Specifically, the fiery pastor wondered why Facebook would allow other issues on its platform but silence innocuous views as well as shut down harmless voices. The pastor had posted a new month’s prayer and bible verses on his Facebook handle which the blue app had taken down. According to Facebook, the post was against the Community Standards. While vowing to quit the app, Giwa said, “This is what Facebook has been doing to me for a long time. As it is, I have nothing to do with them. Before they invented it, the world was okay. “After establishing Facebook, things have turned upside down. They dine and wine with governments in power across the globe. Lies can’t kill the truth, impossible!. “They claimed that my prayer was against their Community Standards. Initially, I didn’t notice they had deleted my post until they left me a message on the 3rd of April, asking me to either agree or disagree with their decision. “Of course, I vehemently disagreed and questioned why they could delete a ‘prayer post’ that had nothing to do with politics. “As a result, I have decided to stop using this platform until they realize their mistakes and tender unreserved apologies. “I am sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you, children of God.”
