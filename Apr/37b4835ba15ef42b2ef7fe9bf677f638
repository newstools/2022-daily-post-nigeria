Former England striker, Gary Lineker, has hit out at Manchester United players following their Premier League 4-0 defeat to Liverpool. Lineker said Man United players were utterly joyless to watch during the tie against Liverpool at Anfield on Tuesday night. He said this in a tweet via his Twitter handle after the Premier League encounter. Lineker tweeted: “That was an absolute demolition job. @LFC were utterly joyous to watch. @ManUtd were utterly joyless to watch.” DAILY POST reports that United performed below average as they lost to Jurgen Klopp’s side. Luis Diaz, Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah all scored for Liverpool against Ralf Rangnick’s side. The result against Man United means Liverpool are on top of the Premier League table at the moment with 76 points from 32 games ahead of Manchester City’s Premier League tie with Brighton on Wednesday night.
