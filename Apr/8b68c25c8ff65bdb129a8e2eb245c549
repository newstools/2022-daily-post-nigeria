Former Arsenal playmaker, Mesut Ozil, has sent Manchester United captain Harry Maguire a message of support after news emerged on Thursday that Cheshire Police went to his house after a fake bomb threat was made. Maguire lives there with his fiancee, Fern Hawkins and their two daughters. A spokesman for Maguire told The Sun: “In the last 24 hours, Harry has received a serious threat to his family home. “He has reported this to the police who are now looking into the matter. “The safety of his family and those around him is obviously Harry’s number one priority.” Reacting to the development, Ozil, in a tweet via his Twitter handle, said he was shocked, describing the news as insane. The former Germany international tweeted: “Just read the news about Harry Maguire … this is just insane. Football can never ever be that serious to be threatening a player and his family. “I’m shocked. Sometimes football brings out the worst in people. Hopefully all people involved get punished.”
