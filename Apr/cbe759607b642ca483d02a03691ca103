Senator Magnus Abe has declared that the constitution of the All Progressives Congress, APC does not allow for the emergence of candidates through consensus. The former Rivers South-East Senator, a loyalist to the National leader of the APC, Bola Tinubu said the presidential ticket of the APC will be duly contested by the aspirants in the party. Abe, who was speaking on Arise Tv on Tuesday was reacting to the latest declaration of Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo for the office of the president. The former senator, however, noted that the latest entry of Osinbajo into the presidential race does not pose any threat to the presidential ambition of the National leader of the APC, Bola Tinubu. According to him, “Osinbajo is a formidable member of the party and he is welcome to the race to contest if he so desires. “The constitution of the All Progressives Congress does not provide for any consensus. “There will be a contest and anybody who knows Asiwaju, knows that he is working on a pathway that will lead him to victory in a contest”.
