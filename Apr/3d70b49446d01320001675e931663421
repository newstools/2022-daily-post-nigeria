The Ex-President of the Nigerian Senate and presidential hopeful on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Bukola Saraki, has disclosed that he and other aspirants of the party are currently working towards coming up with a consensus presidential candidate that has the capacity to address the prevailing insecurity in Nigeria. He stated this after a closed-door with the Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu at his country-home Umuobiakwa community in Obingwa Local Government Area of the state, alongside other notable presidential aspirants of the PDP. His statement was contained in a press release made available to DAILY POST on Friday in Umuahia, the state capital. The aspirants were in Abia on the possibility of a consensus presidential candidate for the main opposition party in Nigeria. Other presidential aspirants who visited the Abia Governor alongside Saraki were the Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal; Senator Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State and Dr Mohammed Hayatudeen. Saraki maintained that the party is driven by the determination to turn Nigeria around and also expressed optimism that the PDP would emerge victorious in the upcoming general election in the country in 2023. Asked why ex-Nigerian vice president, Atiku Abubakar was not in the delegation of the party’s presidential aspirants, Saraki, also a former Governor of Kwara State, explained that, “he is fully part of the mission and received full briefings on their consensus mission”. According to the release by Ememanka, Governor Okezie Ikpeazu was joined in receiving the PDP Presidential aspirants by a delegation led by the State Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Hon Christopher Ekweremadu and a foremost industrialist, Elder Raymond Aliga.
