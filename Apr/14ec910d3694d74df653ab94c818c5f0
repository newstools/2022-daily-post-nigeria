Suspected bandits have unleashed terror attack on Tsafe town in Zamfara State, killing the son of the state Commissioner for Security and Home Affairs, DIG Mamman Tsafe (Rtd) and three others. According to an eyewitness, the dastardly act occurred on Sunday night when bandits clad in military uniform stormed Shiyar Namada area of the town. DAILY POST learnt that the commissioner’s son, who was sitting at the front of the house during the break of fast with others, could not escape when the bandits invaded the area. They opened fire on them and them on the spot. “The attack created serious confusion as most people observing Tarawih prayer in several mosques around the area had to flee to safety,” a source said. Another source on Monday morning said that the attack was terrible, adding that, “I’m at the Waziri’s residence where preparations for their funeral are underway.” This medium also gathered that the attack might also be a reprisal as a suspected bandit, who was seen at the outskirts of the town last Friday, was beheaded by the local vigilante otherwise known as Yan Sakai. At the time of filing this report, the state police command or the state government were yet to react to the Incident. Recall, in recent times, Tsafe town and surrounding communities had witnessed a series of assaults and kidnappings.
