Former Chelsea star, Frank Leboeuf, has blamed Edouard Mendy and Antonio Rudiger following the Blues’ Champions League quarter-final first-leg 3-1 loss to Real Madrid on Wednesday night at Stamford Bridge. Leboeuf also gave credit to Real Madrid’s Karim Benzema, insisting that the France international deserves to win every accolade, including the Ballon d’Or. He blamed Mendy and Rudiger after their mix-up resulted in a third goal for Real Madrid. Recall that Mendy and Rudiger failed to clear the ball with Chelsea trailing 2-1 in their Champions League last-8 first leg tie, allowing Benzema the easy task of slotting in to complete his hat-trick against Thomas Tuchel’s men. The mistake saw Real Madrid ease further in front at Stamford Bridge, leaving the Premier League giants with a mountain to climb when both sides meet in the second leg next week and Cole admitted the two players got it ‘wrong’. “I don’t give credit to the people who win the Ballon d’Or because I don’t give a stuff about it, but I will give credit to Karim Benzema because he is definitely, if not the best striker, he will have to share it with Mbappe,” Leboeuf told ESPN. “Ask people to watch the 3rd goal, yes it’s a mistake between Mendy and Rudiger but what Benzema does with a 50 metre sprint to chase Mendy and then Rudiger is absolutely fantastic.”
