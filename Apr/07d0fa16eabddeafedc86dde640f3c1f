Muslim faithful observing the ongoing Ramadan fast in Taraba State have again been thrown into mourning as unknown gunmen have killed a monarch in another mosque. The incident came barely two weeks after armed bandits launched an attack on a mosque in Bali local government council killing three persons and living others with various degrees of injuries. The recent attack which took place on Monday in Maisamari town of Sardauna local government council in the Mambilla Plateau, as gathered by our correspondent, occurred at about 7:25 pm when the Muslims were observing their Ishaa prayers in the mosque. The gunmen, who were alleged to have stormed the mosque in their numbers, were said to have been shooting sporadically, leading to the death of the district head. Our source who gave the name of the deceased district head as Alhaji Abdulkadir Maisamari said several worshippers also escaped with various degrees of injuries. Unlike the attack that took place in Bali council where several worshippers were abducted, the attackers could not kidnap anybody. Another source who also craved anonymity told our correspondent that the activities of hoodlums in the area are becoming unbearable for the people who according to him, have not been going to bed with their two eyes closed. He urged the state government and the security operatives to put in place measures that will cripple the activities of hoodlums who he said: “are bandits fleeing from other parts of the country to Taraba.” The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Usman Abdullahi, who confirmed the incident, could not give more details, as the Divisional Police Officer of the area, according to him, is still being expected to reach out to the command with more information.
