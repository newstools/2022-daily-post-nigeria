Real Madrid boss, Carlo Ancelotti, on Saturday, made history following his side’s LaLiga title triumph. Ancelotti watched as Real Madrid defeated Espanyol 4-0 at the Santiago Bernabeu to win this season’s LaLiga title ahead of Barcelona and Sevilla. A brace from Rodrygo and a strike each from Marco Asensio and Karim Benzema gave Real Madrid the victory over Espanyol. The LaLiga title triumph means Ancelotti has now become the first manager in history to win all five major European Leagues (Serie A, Premier League, Ligue 1, Bundesliga and LaLiga). The Italian had previously won the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich (2016-2017), Ligue 1 with PSG (2012-2013), Premier League with Chelsea (2009-2010), Serie A with AC Milan (2003-2004). Meanwhile, Ancelotti will hope to lead his team to beat Manchester City when they host the Premier League champions in the Champions League semi-final second-leg tie on Wednesday.
