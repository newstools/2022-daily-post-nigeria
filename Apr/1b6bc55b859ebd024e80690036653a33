Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky has hailed the citizens for their refusal to give their backing to Russia’s occupying forces. Russia plans to stage a referendum in the occupied Kherson region of Ukraine on Wednesday (today). Russia announced it will hold a referendum in the region, which its forces have occupied since the opening weeks of the invasion. The people will be asked to approve the “independence” of a new entity called “the Kherson People’s Republic.” “People [in occupied towns] have shown with their protest their attitude towards the occupiers; [they have] shown that Ukraine will definitely win,” Zelensky said in his nightly video address. “Russia wants to stage a sham ‘referendum’ somewhere on our land? Even if they try, it will be as shameful as everything else that was ‘created’ in Moscow to support the occupation of Ukraine,” he added. The war in Ukraine, which has caused indescribable damage already, enters its third month on Monday.
