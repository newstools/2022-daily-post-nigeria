Apostle Johnson Suleman of the Omega Fire Ministries has said Nigerians do not trust Igbos because they don’t support themselves. The cleric, while preaching in his church, said Igbos tear themselves down at any given opportunity. Citing reference of how Igbos have fought against each other, Suleman said an Igbo Senate President, Evan Enwerem was removed by another Igbo man, Chuba Okadigbo. According to him, Okadigbo was also replaced by Anyim Pius Anyim. The clergyman explained that someone who could sell his brother would not be trusted by anyone. ‘’Somebody from the South, somebody from the East. You betray your people. Look at this agitation for Biafra. Who are the people attacking Biafra most, Igbos. Shameless Igbos. “Am I in support of Nigeria dividing, No! Am I in support of Nigeria separating, No. Do I believe we should be together? Yes. But even if you don’t agree with the man who is your brother, should you say it publicly if you are not a fool? Can’t you say it amongst your people?” He said. He also alleged that if an Igbo man employs an Igbo boy in his shop, the boy will wreck him. “He will carry all the man’s money, he will buy land. He wouldn’t wait to be settled. “The problem of Igbo is Igbo. I repeat it, if you sell your brother, even the buyers will not trust you,” he stated.
