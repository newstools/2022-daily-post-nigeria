Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has said “nobody likes” Antonio Rudiger’s decision to leave the club this summer. Rudiger is closing in on a free transfer to Real Madrid. The Germany international also attracted attention from Bayern Munich and Manchester United. But the 29-year-old, whose current deal expires at the end of the season, will sign a four-year deal with the LaLiga giants. Tuchel was asked about Rudiger’s imminent departure ahead of tomorrow’s trip to Manchester United. He said: “I don’t think anybody likes it. He gives everybody confidence in the dressing room. He is a unique character and plays on an outstanding level. He sometimes takes the focus towards him, he loves responsibility. “Nobody likes this decision but we have to accept it. Like it or not there will be life at Chelsea after Toni. It is also the most important thing for us that it ends like it started, on the highest level.” Rudiger won five trophies with Chelsea, including last year’s Champions League.
