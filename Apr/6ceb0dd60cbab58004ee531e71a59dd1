Manchester United legend, Wayne Rooney has urged Paul Pogba to be honest with his performance for the club since his return to Old Trafford from Juventus. Rooney believes it is time for Pogba to leave Man United and look for a new club in the summer. According to him, Pogba has not really had the right impact at Man United compared to his performance for France’s national team. Pogba departed Man United in 2012 as a teenager before returning to the Premier League giants three years later. The midfielder has been unable to turn Man United into consistent title contenders. His contract with Man United will expire at the end of the season. “I think it’s probably got to a point where it probably is better for him to move on,” Rooney told Sky Sports. “I think if Paul is honest with himself, he probably hasn’t had the impact he would have liked since he returned to Manchester United. “I watch him play for France, and he’s a completely different player. The ability, his vision, and control of the game is there every game for France. It just hasn’t quite worked at Manchester United for him,” he said.
