Dr Olusegun Mimiko, former Governor of Ondo State, has described the late Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III, Alaafin of Oyo, as a monarch who was dearly loved by his people. Mimiko, in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media and Digital Communications, John Paul Akinduro, the late Alaafin can be described as fulfilled in all ramifications. According to the statement, “the late Oba Adeyemi lived a fulfilled life in all spheres. He was a one-of-a-kind king and a people’s monarch who cared about the welfare of his people and development of Nigeria”. The former governor further described the deceased monarch as one whose transition will leave a big vacuum in traditional leadership in the Yoruba race and the country at large. “The late Oba Adeyemi III enjoyed an uncommon grace of a long and successful reign that every monarch pray for. “No doubt, he will be dearly missed by his people. I commiserate with the government and people of Oyo state over the demise of this great monarch. May his soul find eternal rest,” he said.
