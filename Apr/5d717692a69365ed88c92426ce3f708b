Former Ekiti Governor, Ayo Fayose has endorsed Kolapo Kolade-Eleka as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for the Ekiti South Senatorial seat. Eleka, a Professor, was the PDP flagbearer in the 2018 Ekiti governorship election. Fayose made the declaration on Saturday during a town hall meeting with stakeholders in Ise/Orun Local Government. The PDP stalwart said his endorsement doesn’t stop other aspirants from contesting the primary election. His support for Eleka, Fayose explained, is in the party’s interest and not against anyone. “Senator Biodun Olujimi, the present occupier of the seat, should see this decision beyond the personal ambition of any individual. “She has benefitted immensely from the party by going to the House of Representatives and Senate for two terms”, Fayose said.
