Former Chief Press Secretary to Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, Mr Terver Akase has debunked reports that he is joining the Vandeikya/Konshisha Federal Constituency race. Akase, who recently dropped his governorship ambition following the zoning of the position by State’s chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, appreciated those calling on him to vie for the Jechira House of Representatives seat. While acknowledging such calls by his teaming supporters, Mr Akase, in a statement by the director of his campaign organization, Nathaniel Nongu stated that he is not nursing any ambition to represent the constituency at the lower chamber. Recall that Akase was in the Benue 2023 governorship race on the PDP platform but the part zoned its ticket to Vandeikya Local Government Area. Akase had publicly accepted the decision of the party, saying he was ready to support whoever the party gives ticket. “We, therefore, urge members of the public to disregard any publication or information linking Akase with the bid for the House of Representatives position. “Mr Akase once more thanks his teeming supporters across the State and beyond for the confidence they have in him and enjoins them to look into the future with hope”, the statement added.
