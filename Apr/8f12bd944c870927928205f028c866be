Barcelona striker, Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang has surpassed the club’s legends, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez’s records by reaching double figures for the Catalan club quicker than the two attackers. Aubameyang moved to Barcelona on an 18-month contract last January from Arsenal. The Gabonese international has been an instant success for Xavi’s men, having scored ten goals in just 14 appearances since joining two months ago. The 32-year-old’s latest goal in Barcelona’s 3-2 victory over Levante means he has scored ten goals of those in his last 11 games, meaning that he has gone into double figures quicker than many club legends such as Messi and Suarez. Recall that Messi’s debut came at the start of his career when he was just 17-years-old and he took 38 games for the Argentine to reach ten goals, while Suarez took 24 matches to reach that figure for the club. Aubameyang has also reached that total quicker than Samuel Eto’o (26 games), David Villa (18 games) and Patrick Kluivert (26). However, only three players, Ronaldo Nazario (9 matches), Romario (9 matches) and Laszlo Kubala (13 matches), have scored ten goals at Barcelona in a faster period of time.
