Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has conferred with Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) members in the South-West ahead of the 2023 elections. The Friday night meeting had in attendance many party stalwarts and stakeholders, including former ministers. Atiku disclosed that he made a passionate appeal for everyone to work together and return PDP to power next year. “My friends from the Southwest particularly agreed that our party has remained in the opposition for too long in the West. “I’m humbled by their shared belief in my capacity to reunite Nigeria and once again bring the PDP back as a major party in the Southwest”, he said. Present were ex-Jigawa and Adamawa Governors, Sule Lamido and Boni Haruna, ex-Minister Kabiru Turaki, and Business mogul Raymond Dokpesi among others. Atiku, who has contested in three presidential elections, is a major contender for the PDP 2023 ticket. Also in the race are former Senate Presidents Bukola Saraki and Anyim Pius Anyim. The rest include Governors Aminu Tambuwal (Sokoto), Bala Mohammed (Bauchi), Nyesom Wike (Rivers), and ex-Anambra Governor Peter Obi.
