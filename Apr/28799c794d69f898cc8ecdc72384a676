Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado Bayero has prayed that Allah makes the best choice for the Presidency of Nigeria in 2023. The revered traditional ruler made the supplication during the visit of Transportation Minister, Rotimi Amaechi to his palace. Speaking in Hausa, Emir Bayero recalled the journey of Amaechi from his days as a lawmaker, a governor and now a federal cabinet member. “I congratulate the Honourable Minister for deciding to run for the highest office in the land following his development from his time as a Speaker to Governor to a Minister. “These antecedents make him qualified to seek the office of the President.” The monarch noted that he knows that all the aspirants in the race mean well and have something to offer Nigerians. “That is why I pray for all running for President; that may All make the best choice”, he said. “I am grateful to the Emir for his warm reception, kind words and for his prayers & blessings”, Amaechi posted on Facebook on Monday. Amaechi rumoured to be the favourite of President Muhammadu Buhari, now moves about in tighter security. The minister declared his intention to occupy the topmost seat in the country last Saturday in Port Harcourt, the capital of Rivers State. In January, President kept mum when asked about his preference of a successor on the grounds that the individual might be killed. Amaechi was turbaned as Dan Amanar Daura (trusted son of Daura) in February. The nation’s leader hails from the town in Katsina State.
