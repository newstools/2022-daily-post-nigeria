The Kaduna Zonal Command of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), on Friday, arraigned one Salamatu Isah (aka Uwar Marayun Matasan Arewa) before Justice Darius Khobo of the state High Court, Kaduna, on a one-count charge bordering on false pretence to provide jobs Salamatu, who is standing trial on multiple fraud charges, is alleged to have tricked her victim into paying the sum of N500,000.00 into her UBA account number 2082694498 on the pretext of helping her secure employment with a lucrative Federal Government parastatal. The complainant alleged that after paying the money, the defendant became evasive and all efforts to get her money back proved abortive. The charge read: “That you, Salamatu Isah sometime in 2020 in Kaduna within the Kaduna Judicial, Division of the High Court with intent to defraud did obtain the total sum of N500,000.00 ( Five Hundred Thousand Naira) only from one Aisha Abdul-Aziz Mohammed under the false pretence that, you will secure an employment for her with NBAIS ( National Board for Arabic Institute Studies) which pretence you knew to be false and you thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 1(1) (a) of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Fraud Related Offences Act 2006 and Punishable Under Section 1(3) of the same Act.” She however pleaded not guilty to the charge when it was read to her. Prosecuting Counsel, E.K Garba, urged the court to remand the defendant and fix a date for commencement of trial. But the defence counsel, Abdulmajid Mustapha, prayed the court to admit his client to bail. The prosecution counsel objected on the ground that he was just served with the bail application in court. Justice Khobo, after listening to both counsels, remanded the defendant in Nigeria Correctional Centre and adjourned till May 11, 2022, for determination of the bail application.
