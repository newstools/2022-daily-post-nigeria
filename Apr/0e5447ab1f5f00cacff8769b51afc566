A presidential aspirant on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Dr Ibrahim Bello Dauda has expressed grave concern over endless killings in Nigeria which he said were occasioned by the proliferation of arms through illegal borders. Dr Dauda, an indigene of Borno State while speaking an interview with journalists in Abuja, decried the nation’s porous borders which were being used illegally to bring in arms and ammunition, adding that if the Federal government “cuts the oxygen” of illegal arms importation, their businesses will die naturally. He said the government cannot continue to police the nation’s borders conventionally, recommending varied digital and satellite means of manning government approved and illegal borders to tackle arms smugglers. He said insecurity continues to fester because the current administration and the previous ones concentrated more on reactive means of tackling insecurity rather than preventive measures. The APC Chieftain said: “On security, both the present and previous administrations have concentrated on reactive rather than preventive measures. “Currently we have porous borders being used for the importation of arms. The arms and ammunition are not manufactured in Nigeria. They are brought in through porous borders. “We have illegal borders, 84 approved while over 1400 approximately illegal on a landmark of 923,728 square kilometres and it’s not easy to police using personnel, so we are going digitally to utilise various means of intelligence.
