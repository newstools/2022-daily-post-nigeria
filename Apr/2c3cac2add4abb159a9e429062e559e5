Former Nigerian goalkeeper, Peter Rufai, has told the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) the best coach to manage the Super Eagles of Nigeria. The NFF is presently in the process of searching for a new manager that will coach Nigeria’s national team after Augustine Eguavoen stepped down. Recall that Eguavoen resigned as interim coach of the Super Eagles after failing to qualify Nigeria for this year’s FIFA World Cup. Nigeria didn’t qualify for the World Cup in Qatar after losing to the Black Stars of Ghana by an away goal at the MKO Abiola Stadium in Abuja last month. However, Rufai wants the NFF to appoint a competent coach for the Super Eagles that is capable of restoring the glory days of Nigeria in football. He also warned the NFF not to make the same old mistake when appointing a new coach, adding that the federation should not rush in making a decision. “It’s very sad that the Super Eagles won’t be at the World Cup, however, we can’t dwell so much on it because there are other games or qualifiers ahead of the team,” Rufai told CompleteSports. “This is the time the NFF must ensure they appoint a competent coach for the senior national team that is capable of restoring the glory days of Nigeria in football. “The NFF does not need to rush when it comes to this issue because it will be sad if we still make the same old mistake again.”
