DAILY POST recalls that Ganduje had on Monday, told Wike that he would not be able to actualise his presidential ambition. Ganduje who spoke when he received the Rivers Governor at the Kano State Government House, also said he appreciates good losers because they have courage. Speaking with BBC Pidgin, Wike said the media was biased in the report, stressing that Ganduje’s comment was a response to his assertion that the All Progressives Congress, APC’s administration has failed. He said, “We were just playing. When I carried the microphone, I told him that I was in his state to talk to delegates who would vote for me. I told the governor that I know that they will soon leave the government because the APC administration failed Nigerians. “I told him that I will take over the government so that I can put things in order so when it was time for him to speak, he said he was sure that I will lose the election, saying I will be a good loser. It was a joke. “I first spoke but the media only picked what he said and ignored why he said that”.
