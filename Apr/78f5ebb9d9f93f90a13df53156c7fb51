Manchester United interim boss, Ralf Rangnick has confirmed he will be without five players for Tuesday’s clash with Liverpool. Rangnick revealed this during his press conference on Monday. Edinson Cavani, Scott McTominay, Luke Shaw and Raphael Varane all missed United’s previous two fixtures; last week’s 1-0 defeat at Everton and the 3-2 victory over Norwich City on Saturday. Rangnick has now confirmed all five remain unavailable and will miss the trip to Anfield. He said: “Rapha [Varane] didn’t train with the team. He was on the pitch with one of our rehab coaches. “But with regard to injured players, we have the same situation that we had in the last two games.”
