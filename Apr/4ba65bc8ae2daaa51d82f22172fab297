Former Super Eagles, Emmanuel Emenike, has revealed he is battling an unknown health condition. Emenike posted a video clip of himself receiving treatment in an unnamed hospital on social media today. His caption read: “God is good, the pain is too much for me and my heart cannot carry it anymore.” Emenike emerged the top scorer at the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations with four goals as Nigeria lifted a continental title in South Africa. But the 34-year-old forward is experiencing a twist of fate, as he is currently battling an ailment, which according to him, seems serious. Emenike made his international debut in 2011 and after scoring nine goals in 37 games, he retired from international football in 2015.
