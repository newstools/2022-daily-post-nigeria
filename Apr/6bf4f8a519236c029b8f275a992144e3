International model, Naomi Campbell has called out the Recording Academy for ignoring Wizkid at the 64th Grammy awards. Wizkid lost his two nominations for Best Global Music Album and Performance on Sunday night. According to Naomi, ‘Essence’ by Wizkid was nominated in the wrong category for the Grammy award and should have been nominated for the Song of the Year category. She accused the Grammy of ignoring millions of people by not giving Afrobeats enough recognition, adding that ‘Made in Lagos’ by Wizkid was beyond a phenomenal album. Her post read: “To my brother, @wizkidayo #MadeinLagos was beyond a phenomenal album !! WINNER WITHOUT DOUBT !! You are the KING of the people, that has bought afrobeat mainstream, that means more than any academy of any sort @recordingacademy Once again you choose to be tone-deaf to what is going on in the universe Changing World to Global is not Enough.” Campbell asked Grammy to also include Afrobeats Artist of the Year, Song and Album of the Year for next year. “Get up to speed on the state of all popular music and include Afrobeats Artist of the Year, Song of the Year, Album of the Year and all the subcategories that this genre so deserves – just as another respected and recognized musical genre. “#MadeinLagos Album and song Essence was clearly in the wrong category how can you ignore the song Essence, The song by Wizkid, and Tems that was covered and remixed by Justin Bieber, you seem to isolate it under global when it should have been in the song of the year category. “This is a misrepresentation and a neglectful categorization of Music ONCE AGAIN. Give Afrobeats the representation it deserves. “You’re Ignoring 1.3 billion people It will only make us Rise !! Afrobeats in our hearts Africabeats to the world,” Naomi wrote.
