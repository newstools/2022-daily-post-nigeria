The presidential aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Dr. Peter Obi, has advised party delegates to vote according to their conscience and not continue to mortgage their future by allowing monetary and other materialism to influence their choice of candidate in the delegate election. Obi while acknowledging that desperate politicians would go to any length to get the party ticket told delegated that ” Politicians will give you money during primaries, collect it and consider an aspirant who would change the country and make it better.” Obi stated this on Thursday when he visited the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Owerri, Imo State. Mr Obi who served as the governor of Anambra State between 2006 and 2014 under the platform of the All Progressive Grand Alliance said,” When I became the governor nobody handed over to me and I operated without a government house. “Everything that will make the country work is fastly collapsing. The country is functioning on a consumptive economy. The only solution to move the country forward is to have a formula for production. Our country is not productive. Mr Obi said,” My pleading to you my delegates is to look at our children’s future. No county of this size is looking for money to feed itself. His words, “Today when we wake up in Nigeria the only thing you here are killings, insecurity everywhere. There is no way you’ll not have a problem when you have 35 percent unemployment rate in the country.
