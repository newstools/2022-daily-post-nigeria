Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola has admitted that his Liverpool counterpart, Jurgen Klopp is the biggest rival of his career. Both tacticians come face-to-face on Sunday in what has been tagged a Premier League title showdown. Guardiola’s men have battled with the Reds for domestic supremacy several times during his reign and this season’s race is going down to the wire again. Reigning champions City are only one point ahead of Liverpool in second place ahead of the crucial clash at the Etihad Stadium. “In the last five years they have been the biggest opponent. They have been an incredible, marvellous contender, with good games. “Jurgen (Klopp), as a manager, has been the biggest rival I’ve ever had in my career. “I will remember my period here, when I’m retired watching and playing golf, I’ll remember my biggest rival was Liverpool, for sure,” Guardiola told reporters.
