Popular singer cum politician Banky W has refuted claims by Samklef over royalties on Wizkid’s ‘Pakurumo’. Banky W, in a post on Instagram, said he was never in control of the royalty split. He clarified that his name was never on the royalty split sheet Samklef posted, advising Samklef to take up the case with Sony. Banky W wrote: “Someone should please explain to Samklef that my name is not and was never on this royalty split sheet that he is posting. “I’ve never controlled it. He needs to take this up with Sony/ASCAP/BMI and his publisher not me. I’ve never taken a dime off those royalties and never will.” Recall that Samklef over the weekend disclosed that Banky W told Wizkid to remove his name as a contributor in Pakurumo. Samklef, who produced Wizkid’s then hit song, claimed that Banky W failed to properly compensate him for his contribution to the song, promising to get his royalties. Alongside the video, he tweeted: “ Nigerians make una see o! They took my name off and put Steve Micheal as composer for pakurumo. @bankywellington how far now? How did we get to this? “Claiming all my 11 years royalties for Wizkid superstar album in a bit. My Lawyers will reach out it is 50/50. “Anybody wey don collect my money better reach out o! Make them tag Banky Wo! My money go don plenty o! Before him go use am campaign for election.”
