Former Aston Villa owner, Simon Jordan, has warned Erik ten Hag that there will be a big challenge for him at Manchester United. Manchester United on Thursday announced that Erik ten Hag will take over from interim manager Ralf Rangnick at the end of the current season. And Jordan, while reacting to the appointment, described the Dutchman as a ‘poor sod’. “Poor sod,” the former Crystal Palace owner told talkSPORT. “I think this guy has a terribly difficult task. “If he’s going to be given an opportunity, he’s got seven transfer windows within the contract he has been given, and he needs all of them to turn this team around. “Irrespective of Ajax and their stature in the Eredivisie, they are a minnow in terms of the expectation at Man United and he’s got the unfortunate situation of going up against Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp. “But, they’ve made a decision, I wish him luck and I hope he gets the whole thing by the throat.”
