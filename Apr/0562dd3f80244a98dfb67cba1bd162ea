The Federal High Court in Lagos State has rejected the no case submission by Dr. Anuoluwapo Funmilayo Adepoju and Med Contour. The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) dragged her to court after a complaint of post-body surgery complications. Anu’s defence team had argued that the prosecution did not make a sufficient answerable prima facie case. On Thursday, the court ruled that the evidence so far tendered satisfied the elements of the criminal charges pending against the defendant. The court adjourned the case to May 26, 2022 for continuation of trial. Babatunde Irukera, the Lead Prosecutor said although the process has experienced delays, the commission remains committed to ensuring compliance to the fullest extent of the law. The FCCPC chief said now that sitting has resumed, relevant applications seeking appropriate judicial orders will be presented. Irukera called for information or evidence of activities that can assist in ensuring obedience of the law or retribution for disobedience.
