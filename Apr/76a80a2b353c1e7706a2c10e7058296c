Real Madrid striker, Karim Benzema has welcomed Paris Saint-Germain’s Kylian Mbappe to the Los Blancos. Benzema said he would like to play with Mbappe at Real Madrid, adding that they would score as many goals in the colours of the LaLiga giants. Benzema and Mbappe are teammates with the France national team. Mbappe is widely expected to join Real Madrid in the upcoming summer transfer window. The 23-year-old is yet to sign a new contract with PSG and his current deal will expire at the end of the season. “Yes, I say it often. I like to play with him in the national team and I would like to play with him at the club level,” Benzema told L’Equipe via Managing Madrid. He added: “I think we would score twice as many goals. Or maybe even triple! With Mbappe, I understand myself well in the national team because we know what the other is going to do. For example, we both like to go to the left, but we will never be there both at the same time.”
