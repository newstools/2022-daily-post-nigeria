Gunmen suspected to be kidnappers, on Wednesday invaded and kidnapped four family members in Shadadi community in Kuje Area Council, Federal Capital Territory (FCT). NAN reports that some residents of the community claimed the incident happened at about 1am after the suspected kidnappers shot sporadically into the air. A relative to the abductees, who preferred anonymity, told NAN that the kidnappers, numbering 10 forcefully gained entrance into the house after shooting sporadically into the air and pulling down the burglary proof. “Immediately they entered at about 1am, they told everybody in the house to lie down with each of them pointing their guns on each member of the family. “The next thing they did was to demand a bag in the house and when one of the family members brought a bag, they rejected it and demanded a particular one. “The family member went inside the room and brought another bag that they accepted and abducted the husband, one of his daughters, his brother and his sister-in-law,” he said. The relative appealed to security agencies, particularly the police to come to the aide of the abductees to ensure their safe release. NAN reports that a team of policemen from the Kuje Divisional Headquarters was seen at the scene of the incident to inspect the area. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), DSP Josephine Adeh said she had not been briefed.
