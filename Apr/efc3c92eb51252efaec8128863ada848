Former Liverpool and Manchester City midfielder, Dietmar Hamann has predicted the winner of Sunday’s Premier League tie between his two former clubs. Man City will host Liverpool at Etihad Stadium on Sunday evening. Pep Guardiola’s men are currently on top of the Premier League table with a point ahead of Liverpool. Man City head to the game following a 1-0 win over Atletico Madrid in the Champions League, while Liverpool defeated Benfica 3-1. Asked to give his prediction, Hamann told TalkSport: “Well, if you look at Liverpool in recent weeks, I think they have got a swagger about them. They have got confidence in them. They played a good first half [against Benfica], then had an iffy, fragile half an hour, but they still found a way to score the third goal.” “Even though Klopp does not say it, that probably does put the tie to bed and I just think that defensively they are probably a bit more solid (than City). When you look at the attacking options, I just think that City only play one way. As we saw yesterday, Liverpool can score all sorts of goals and I really do think that Liverpool won’t get beat.”
