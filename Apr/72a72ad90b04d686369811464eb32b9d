Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti has heaped praises on his captain, Karim Benzema, following his impressive showing against Chelsea in the Champions League on Wednesday night. Benzema scored a hat-trick at Stamford Bridge, as Los Blancos won 3-1, taking a big advantage into the second leg of the quarter-final tie. Ancelotti hailed “a fantastic performance up front” from the French striker, but immediately turned his attention to their next league fixture against Getafe this weekend. “It was a good night but it is only the first half of this round.’ “It was really good. We showed good organisation defensively. We had a fantastic performance up front from Benzema. A good performance. “We have an advantage. We have to prepare for the next game in the league and then Tuesday will be another game,” Ancelotti said.
