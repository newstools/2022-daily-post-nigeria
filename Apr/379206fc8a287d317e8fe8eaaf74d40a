Germany’s Defense Ministry has announced that the country has finally agreed to deliver anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine. This move underscores a major shift in Germany’s approach to providing military help to Ukraine. Defence Minister, Christine Lambrecht made the announcement to deliver the Gepard anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine during a meeting of international defense officials at the Ramstein US Air Force base on Tuesday. “We decided yesterday that we will support Ukraine with anti-aircraft systems … which is exactly what Ukraine needs now to secure the airspace from the ground,” Lambrecht said during the meeting at the base. This is the first time Germany has agreed to send such help to Ukraine and it is coming despite Russia’s warning that no such weapons should be provided to Ukraine. The Gepard systems were phased out from active duty in Germany in 2010. Germany had earlier resisted any temptation to provide weaponry to Ukraine, saying it would only focus on providing humanitarian help and medical equipment. This move, however, is against Russia’s earlier warning that any country, especially in the European Union that provides lethal weapons to Ukraine during the ongoing war, would face the consequences of such action.
