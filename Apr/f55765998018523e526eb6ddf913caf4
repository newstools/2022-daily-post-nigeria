The Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, says he will soon announce his decision on whether to run for the 2023 presidency or not. Ngige said he used the season of lent to commune with God, and he spoke back to him. Speaking when he met his followers in Awka, Anambra State on Saturday, the minister said he has consulted widely and would soon reveal his decision. According to Ngige, he would disclose his position on running for the Presidency or not on Tuesday or Wednesday. Ngige said: “I want to assure you that the period of lent we ended it last night. “And during this period, we communed with God; we did our fasting; we talked to God and the angels and God spoke back to us. God has spoken to me. “I want to assure you that I will also not disappoint you.” Stressing that he would speak in a language his followers would understand, the minister said, “It will be very soon — either Tuesday or Wednesday before I go back to Abuja.” Recently, Ngige said he would reveal his presidential intention during the Easter period.
