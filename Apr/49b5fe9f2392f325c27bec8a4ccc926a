The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) says it has arrested a notorious queen of a drug cartel, Lami Rigima, who is supplying psychoactive substances to traffickers in Taraba. The NDLEA Spokesman, Mr Femi Babafemi, said in a statement in Abuja on Wednesday that NDLEA operatives made the arrest months after being on the wanted list. Babafemi said that the 40-year-old came under the anti-narcotic agency’s searchlight when a number of traffickers arrested in the state in 2021 and early this year fingered her as their supplier. He said that the manhunt for Lami paid off on Monday, April 4, when operatives tracked her to her hideout in Iware village in Ardo Kola Local Government Area of Taraba. According to him, the search for Lami began in October 2021 following the arrest, prosecution and conviction of a 50-year drug dealer, Abdullahi Madaki. “After serving his brief jail sentence, Madaki returned to the illicit trade with Lami still as his supplier. “He was, however, rearrested on Feb. 13, while another trafficker, Jamilu Hassan, 20, who is also a member of Lami’s supply chain, was nabbed on February 24,” he said.
