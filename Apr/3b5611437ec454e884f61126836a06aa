Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti, has said both David Alaba and Casemiro could miss their Champions League semi-final against Manchester City on Tuesday. The two players have muscular problems and, while both were included in the travelling squad, there is serious doubt about their availability for the game. Ancelotti, however, will be able to call upon fullback Ferland Mendy, who has returned to full training. “From what we saw yesterday in training, we have some doubts about Alaba and some more doubts about Casemiro,” the Italian said at his pre-match press conference. “Training will tell us more. We have more confidence with Alaba with Casemiro.”
