Chelsea defender, Antonio Rudiger, has been slammed as greedy over his reported move to Real Madrid. Former Crystal Palace owner, Simon Jordan, also described the Germany international as ‘good riddance’ . Rudiger is said to have agreed a move to Real Madrid, a switch that will bring an end to his spell at Stamford Bridge. The Blues, according to their manager, Thomas Tuchel, have worked tirelessly to try and tie Rudiger down to a new contract. The player, however, wants a fresh start to his career, despite his huge popularity in West London. However, according to Jordan, Chelsea are better off without him. “Absolute greed! Good riddance!” he told talkSPORT. “Antonio Rudiger is going to Real Madrid because he is greedy!” Jordan is happy to see Rudiger leave Chelsea and does not want the club to agree to the German’s contract demands
