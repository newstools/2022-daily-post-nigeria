The President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government has come under criticism over the bombing of a Kaduna-Abuja train by terrorists. Reno Omokri, a socio-political activist, alleged that the terrorists responsible for the bombing were government approved. To back up his claim, Omokri lamented the inability of the Nigerian Government to locate and arrest these bandits. The former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan wondered why the Nigerian Government that arrested a pro-Biafra agitator, Nnamdi Kanu has failed to arrest these terrorists. In a tweet, Omokri said if Islamic cleric, Sheikh Gumi can locate these bandits why can’t the Federal Government locate them. He wrote: “The terrorists that bombed the Abuja-Kaduna train are government-approved. You doubt me? Okay. See how Gumi is able to meet them at will. “Are you trying to tell me that if Gumi can locate them, then the Buhari government that located Kanu in Kenya can’t locate them?” On Monday, Bandits attacked a rail line between the Katari and Rinjana train stations along the Kaduna-Abuja route. The bandits killed several passengers on board the Kaduna-bound train, while others were injured.
