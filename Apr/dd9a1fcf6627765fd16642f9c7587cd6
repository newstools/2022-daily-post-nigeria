Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi has revealed that he would abide by whatever decision the All Progressives Congress, APC, take in terms of who emerges as the party’s presidential candidate. Amaechi is one of the APC presidential candidates who would battle for the sole ticket during the presidential primaries next week. The former Rivers Governor expressed his loyalty to President Muhammadu Buhari and the APC during a consultative meeting with executives, delegates and other party faithful at the Rivers State APC Secretariat on Friday. The Minister said that it was sad that many politicians do not understand the concept of loyalty. He explained that being loyal does not translate to only favourable moments when someone is chosen as the party candidate. The former Governor said that loyalty means that one follows his or her leaders and surrenders to their leadership. “Those who are disloyal, I wish them well, those who want to do whatever they want to do, I wish them well,” Amaechi said.
