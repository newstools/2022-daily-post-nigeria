Police said the land was discovered on April 2, having been cultivated for the planting of Indian hemp.

Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Abimbola Oyeyemi, identified the suspects as Nelson Enu, Samuel Paul, Patrick Emmanuel, Ekioya Joe, Endurance Eliobe, Monday Okoro and Stanley Ogejiagba, saying they were all arrested following credible intelligence gathered by policemen at Isara division. The police were informed that the suspects had cultivated the land for planting Indian hemp at Lokuta village, Remo North Local Government Area of Ogun. “The intelligence further revealed that the suspects were threatening the lives of the villagers who did not initially know what they wanted to use the cultivated land for, for daring to disturb them while the planting was going on,” Oyeyemi said in a statement on Tuesday.
