Everton boss, Frank Lampard, said that the support his team got from the crowd motivated them to beat Manchester United in the Premier League on Saturday. Everton were able to put their midweek defeat to Burnley aside as they stood their ground and put Manchester United to sword on Saturday afternoon. Lampard also said it was not the time for the Toffees to play beautiful football but fight and make sure they escape relegation knocking on their door. Raff Rangnick’s side struggled to.make any effort after Anthony Gordon’s 27th minute opener for Everton. “At Goodison we have been good. We are getting clean sheets at home. When we come together with fans and players we are hard to beat here. “The crowd were great but they could switch off if they see people not working. When you are not at your best you have to fight through it. “Beautiful football can come later on. But in the position we are in, fighting comes first and foremost.”
