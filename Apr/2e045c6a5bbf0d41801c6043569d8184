A pro-Biafra group, Biafra National League (BNL) based in Bakassi, Cross River State, has accused Cameroonian forces of killing their commander. One of the officials, who pleaded not to be named, spoke to DAILY POST Saturday evening. He explained that the Cameroonian forces killed Honesty Udom, better known as the Black Scorpion, commander of their Black Marine squad, in his house in the Atabong area of Bakassi. According to this source, the Cameroonian forces had acted on a tip-off. The source did not disclose if Black Scorpion had ventured into Cameroonian territory with arms, or was caught in some criminal acts or had attacked the Cameroonians. He also denied that there was a gunfire exchange. “I am not sure that there was a fire exchange. The information from other commanders is that Honesty was killed in his house in Atabong in Bakassi. “The Cameroonian troops had intelligence about him and traced him to his house. “I cannot really tell what went wrong or what crimes he committed against the Cameroon,” he said. He confirmed that he was killed on Thursday morning.
