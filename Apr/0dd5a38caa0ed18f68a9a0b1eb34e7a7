The Police Public Relations Officer, Lagos State Command, Benjamin Hundeyin, has confirmed that one Toyosi Adesegun and two men will be arraigned over false allegations of rape and kidnap. Toyosi, with the handle, @_misteriouss, tweeted that “I’m being kidnapped guys. I’m being raped. Number 78 Obayan street, Pako, Akoka, Lagos”. She later admitted in another tweet that “it was false. I’m so sorry for this. Please stop calling and threatening the numbers”. However, Toyosi may have landed herself in hot soup, as the State Command has taken up the case. After she voluntarily presented herself at the police station, Hundeyin wrote on Twitter “that 20-year-old Toyosi Adesegun, female, is a regular visitor to Olamilekan Faruk, Ayanfe Ayinde and Olusola Onipede, all male of 78 Obayan Street Akoka. “This morning, she was restrained from leaving the apartment by the young men. Toyosi threatened to tweet what she tweeted if she was not allowed to leave. “The young men called her bluff and she tweeted. “Based on the foregoing, the three men will be arraigned for wrongful restraint, while Toyosi will be arraigned for giving false information.”
