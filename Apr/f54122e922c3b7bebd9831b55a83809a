The Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ, Ekiti State Council has called on Muslims, particularly journalists to use the holy month of Ramadan to seek the face of Allah over the various challenges facing the country. In a statement in Ado Ekiti, Chairman of NUJ, Comrade Rotimi Ojomoyela said it had become so obvious that Nigeria needed divine intervention going by the incredible happenings such as wanton killings and kidnapping of innocent persons, as well as economic downturn. Ojomoyela said, “I believe in the power of prayer, especially in the holy month of Ramadan, let us lay bare the challenges of Nigeria before Allah and I have confidence that our prayers shall be accepted.” He congratulated Muslim journalists for the grace of Allah that sustained their lives to witness the season and prayed Allah to grant them the blessings of the holy month.
