Former Liverpool and Manchester United striker, Michael Owen, has predicted Tuesday’s Champions League quarter-final second leg fixtures. Real Madrid will host Chelsea in the Champions League second leg tie at the Santiago Bernabeu following a 3-1 win in the first leg last week. Bayern Munich will face Villarreal in Germany after losing 1-0 to the LaLiga side in the first leg in Spain last week. Providing his predictions, Owen was quoted by BetVictor as saying: “That was a brilliant result for Real Madrid in London. There is only one man to talk about, Karim Benzema! “Chelsea had chances at Stamford Bridge and probably should have scored more. I can see them scoring in Madrid, but Real are so experienced and will do enough to go through. 1-1.” Speaking on the Bayern Munich vs Villarreal game, Owen said: “What a result in Spain that was for Villarreal. I just fear they are going to regret some of those missed chances. “Bayern are a different animal at home and cruised to the win over Salzburg in Munich in the last round. I don’t see this being anywhere close to as emphatic, but I fancy Bayern. 2-0.” The kick-off time for the match is 8 pm, Nigerian time.
