President Muhammadu Buhari has described the flood that claimed over 300 lives in South Africa as saddening and highly devastating. In a message of sympathy to the South African Government, Buhari said the wave of human and natural disasters, including climate change, should call for a collective approach to tackling them. He took to a statement by his media aide, Garba Shehu to express his sympathy. Recall that a flood occurred in Kwazulu Natal Province of South Africa which has so far claimed 341 lives. Reacting to the calamity on Friday in Abuja, the President said, “I’m greatly shocked by this large-scale natural disaster which has caused widespread sufferings and fatalities in our sister country.” He explained that “the disruption of water and electricity supply, as well as the destruction of homes, makes this natural disaster one of the worst in our recent memory.” While extending his sympathy to the government and people of South Africa, Buhari suggested that other African leaders should “work together towards developing common and effective strategies for improving our emergency management response systems that will help us significantly reduce the human and economic impacts of natural disasters and impending climate change.”
