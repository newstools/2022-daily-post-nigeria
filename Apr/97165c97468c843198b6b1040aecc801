Paris Saint-Germain manager, Mauricio Pochettino, is shocked that Manchester United snubbed him for Erik ten Hag, The Athletic reports. It is understood that Pochettino was caught unaware by Ten Hag’s appointment. Ten Hag was confirmed as United’s new manager on Thursday morning and has agreed a three-year deal with the option of an additional year. Before his appointment, the Ajax manager had been battling Pochettino for the Old Trafford job, with the two tacticians emerging as the frontrunners. However, Pochettino had not been informed by the Premier League club that Ten Hag had emerged as United’s priority target and was caught by surprise. The timing of the news was “awkward” as Pochettino had felt “confident”. His representatives had held discussions with United over contract details as late as this month. Two months before Ten Hag’s appointment, Pochettino is said to have been gathering information about Manchester as a city, the structure of the club and the personality of United players.
