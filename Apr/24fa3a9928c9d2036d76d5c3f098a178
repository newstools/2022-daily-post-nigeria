Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) has urged Akwa Ibom Governor, Udom Emmanuel and the traditional rulers to intervene in the crisis between Yorubas and indigenes of the state. OPC lamented that the violence in Mkpanak, Ibeno Local Government Area, claimed the lives of some Yorubas from Ilaje Ese Odo. A statement on Saturday by the spokesman, Yinka Oguntimehin, stressed the urgent need for intervention to ensure peace between the host community and other ethnic groups. Oguntimehin condemned the wanton killing and destruction of lives and property and charged the governor to investigate the crisis and bring the culprits to book. The OPC noted that Yoruba people in the South-West are very accommodating and do not threaten the well-being of non-indigenes. “Yorubas in the East should be allowed to enjoy their peace wherever they reside. In this age and time, communal crises are outdated. “It should not be the best option to settle minor disagreements. It is sad that a business disagreement between two people can lead to such a gory incident. “The reports at our disposal have it that no fewer than 12 members of the Yoruba community in Eket have been killed while 25 others were still missing,” the statement read. Oguntimehin said a number of houses, vehicles and fishing boats belonging to Yorubas in the area have been razed. The organization appealed to all warring factions to desist from acts capable of worsening the situation.
