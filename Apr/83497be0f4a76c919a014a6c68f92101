The Speaker of the Taraba State House of Assembly, Joseph Albasu Kunini has condemned in strong terms the bomb blast that rocked Iware community yesterday. A local drinking joint, it would be recalled, was on Tuesday, thrown into disarray following a bomb explosion that did not only kill several persons, but left scores with various degrees of injures. The Speaker, who made the condemnation on Wednesday, in Jalingo, the State capital, described the dastardly act by the faceless people as “bestial and inhuman, considering the relative peace the State has enjoyed.” Viewing the act as “disdainful”, “the dastardly act by the miscreants”, according to him, came at the time “when the State Government has been doing everything humanly possible for peace to reign and ensure security of lives and property of the people.” He urged the security agencies to brace up and tackle the ugly trend head on. The State, which he also described as the most peaceful in the North East geopolitical zone, could not afford to witness the carnage and new wave of terrorism. Calling on Tarabans to be vigilant and conscious of the people they relate with, as well as report suspicious persons to the appropriate authorities, especially with the commencement of the electioneering campaigns, all hands, as suggested by him, must be on deck to checkmate hoodlums’ activities.
