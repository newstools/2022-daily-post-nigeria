Chelsea has unveiled a banner at their stadium in honour of former Nigeria captain, John Obi Mikel. The banner has ‘Taking the Mikel’ emblazoned on it and is in tribute to their ex-midfielder. It was unveiled at the Matthew Harding stand of the 40,834 capacity Stamford Bridge Stadium. Mikel Obi made 374 appearances for the Blues and scored six times. He won a Champions League title, one Europa League, two Premier League titles, three FA Cup titles and one Football League Cup (Carabao Cup) title with Chelsea. Chelsea football fanzine @onlyapound made the announcement on Twitter. He wrote: “Very pleased to feature a couple of photos of the latest banner to adorn the Matthew Harding Stand supplied by my good pal Dash, it’s a tribute to @mikel_john_obi, a player who in my opinion is one of the most underrated in the modern era of @ChelseaFC @ John Terry26.”
