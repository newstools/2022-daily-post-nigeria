The Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) has called on political parties in Cross River State to continue to maintain peace and order as they intensify activities toward the general election next year. It has encouraged aggrieved politicians and their parties to resort to competent law courts, if need be, to resolve their grievances instead of shedding blood. Chairman of IPAC in the state, Ogar Osim made this call and in his address when representatives of parties met at the INEC office in Calabar. “We would like to call on all political parties in the state to maintain peace and order in the spirit of great sportsmanship. “To parties that may be aggrieved, if need be, seek redress in legitimate Courts instead of fighting each other and blood-shedding.” Ogar warned that the parties cannot afford to start with disorganized and unproductive bickering amongst themselves. He said politicians should avoid the pitfalls by guiding and ensuring that they do not ‘measure the sea with both legs’. On the part of IPAC, Ogar said they are poised to encourage every political party in the state to carry out their activities within the context of the law. He added that the new leadership of IPAC is coming up with a range of programmes intended to raise the profile and capability of the platform in the discharge of its mandate of building bridges across party divides and promoting harmony between organs and arms of government, institutions and agencies as a way of deepening democracy in the state. He assured that they will continue to work with INEC to sustain peace and tranquillity in Cross River State.
