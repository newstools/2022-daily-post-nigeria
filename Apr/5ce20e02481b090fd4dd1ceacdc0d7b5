The Bishop, Diocese of Nike (Anglican Communion), Rt. Revd. Christian Onyia has condemned rising cases of violence against women. The religious leader, in his Easter message signed by spokesman Chiwuike Uba, stated that “no one should remain in an abusive marriage”. He urged Nigerians to reflect on the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and rededicate themselves to living in peace, oneness and love of God. The Bishop said despite the insecurity across the federation, Nigerians should not lose trust in God but live in peace and unity. “At the start of our forty-day Lenten journey, through the mark of ashes in the Sign of the Cross, we were reminded that, as humans, we will die.” He noted that while death is inevitable, it no longer has a claim upon believers because God’s word “is the same for Jesus Christ, who was crucified, died, laid in the tomb and resurrected”. Onyia appealed to citizens not to allow ethnicity, religious beliefs or places of origin to continue to divide Nigeria. The Bishop declared that violence against women “is both a sin and a crime” and “is never justified.” “No one should remain in an abusive marriage. Marriages are broken by violence and abuse rather than divorce.” The cleric further advised everyone to respond with compassion, solidarity and care for those suffering and the vulnerable.
