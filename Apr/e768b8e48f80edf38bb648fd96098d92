Governor Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed of Bauchi State, at the weekend, said though he pleaded to some of his political aides and commissioners not to resign from his cabinet, they insisted on leaving to run for different political offices ahead of the 2023 general elections. He added that he would not stop any one of them from pursuing their ambitions. The governor said this when he presided over the State Executive Council meeting, saying that as he was running for president, the commissioners and aides also have the right to pursue their ambitions. According to the governor, it was political time with the guidelines and timetable already out, while aspirants were purchasing forms already. “We are all politicians. This is a political time, the time has come. The timetable is out. The guidelines are out and political forms are out. I know that there are so many of us that are political gladiators. “Those that want to go and those that I’m trying to request to stay back and those that refused to stay back. They have the right to refuse because we won’t step upon their universal suffrage. “I may be meeting with some of you for the last time because the timetable is out. As for me, I enjoy working with you,” the governor told his cabinet members. It was learnt that three commissioners have so far not indicated their interest in contesting for various political offices but also obtained nomination forms. These are Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Nuhu Zaki; Commissioner for Health, Dr Samaila Dahuwa; and Commissioner for Power, Science and Technology, Maryam Bagel. It was also gathered that while the three have already obtained nomination forms, the Commissioner for Works and Transport, Abdulkadir Chikasoro; and the Special Adviser to Governor Mohammed on Legal Matters, Kefas Magaji, are nursing political ambitions.
