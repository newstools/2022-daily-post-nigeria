Five key Manchester United players will not be part of the squad that will take on Norwich City in Saturday’s Premier League tie at Stamford Bridge. This was disclosed by Manchester United manager, Ralf Rangnick, during his pre-match press conference on Friday. Rangnick said the likes of Scott McTominay, Luke Shaw, Edinson Cavani, Fred and Raphael Varane would not take part in the Norwich clash. Rangnick’s men head to the game following a 1-0 defeat to Everton in their last game at Goodison Park. “Five players will still be missing for tomorrow, and probably some of them also for the upcoming games,” Rangnick told reporters. “You already mentioned Fred and Scott. Rapha Varane, Luke Shaw had his bolts and metal stuff removed from his leg and Edinson Cavani, those are the five that will be missing.” The kick-off time for Man United vs Norwich is 3 pm.
