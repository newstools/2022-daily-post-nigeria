Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has described the conduct of the 2022 local government elections in Benue State as peaceful, fair and credible. The Governor made the observation at LGEA Primary School, Gbajimba, Guma Local Government Area shortly after casting his vote. He expressed happiness with the large turnout of the people to cast their votes across the state, stressing that having worked very hard, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) would come out victorious. He said that despite the invasion of the local government by Fulani terrorists which has made more than half of the local government displaced, the massive turnout by voters is a clear testimony that the people are conscious of their rights by actively participating in all democratic processes for good governance.  The Governor advised the incoming chairmen and councillors to repay the confidence the people have in voting for them by working with the state government to bring development and peace at the grassroots. The Governor had, before casting his vote, visited the two Internally Displaced Persons camps in Gbajimba where he provided them with food items, meat and cash. The food items include ten thousand tubers of yam, 100 bags of rice and four pigs. Governor Ortom, while addressing the IDPs, enjoined them to remain peaceful and exercise patience as the government was working hard to end the Fulani invasion which has kept them away from their ancestral homes and to enable them to go back to their respective villages.
