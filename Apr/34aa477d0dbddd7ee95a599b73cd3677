The abductors of Abuja-Kaduna train passengers have said their aim was not to gain ransom from the Federal Government, saying they don’t want money. In a video released by the assailants on Wednesday, the bandits stated that the government knew what they wanted, and threatened to kill the victims if the demands were not met. The video was made sequel to the release of a victim, Mr Alwan Hassan, Managing Director of Bank of Agriculture. One of the bandits, who spoke in Hausa language, said the MD was released due to his age and in the spirit of Ramadan. “We are the group that recently abducted passengers on the train. Among them is this man that has been pleading with us due to his old age and we felt pity on him because of the month of Ramadan, so, we want to give him back to his family,” they said in the video. Another bandit, who was amongst others in military uniform, concurred with what their leader said, and asked the FG not to investigate them, else, the victims will be killed. He said, “I want to reiterate that what he said is true. Don’t try to try to investigate us immediately or to rescue them because killing them is not an issue for us. “We don’t want your money, if we wanted money, we wouldn’t have carried out the attack. You know what we want”.
