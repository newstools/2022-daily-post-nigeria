Wayne Rooney’s Derby County have been relegated from the Championship. The Rams were defeated 1-0 by Queens Park Rangers on Monday, while Reading played out a thrilling 4-4 draw with Swansea City. Rooney was able to guide Derby to safety on the final match of the 2020/2021 campaign. However, he was unable to repeat the feat this time around, as they drop down to the third-tier of English football. Their chances of survival took a huge blow last November when the English Football League imposed a 21-point deduction on the club and they entered administration. Rooney began his managerial career with Derby, after cutting short his playing days at MLS side, DC United, in November 2020. The former England and Manchester United striker has said he will only remain at the club next season if there are new owners with American businessman Chris Kirchner named as the preferred bidder to take over. The 36-year-old has already turned down the opportunity to manage former club Everton this season while also saying his “dream job” would be a return to Old Trafford.
