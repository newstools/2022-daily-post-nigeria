Some members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Irepodun local government and Orolu local government have kicked against the alleged attempt made by Osogbo/Olorunda local government’s party leaders and stakeholders to hijack the House of Representatives ticket previously zoned to them. The Secretary of the APC in Osogbo Federal Constituency, Hon Abayomi Oyedeji, in a communique issued after a meeting on Monday in Ilobu, said that the conduct of the political affairs in the constituency has been with mutual agreement and respect for each other, adding that the zoning arrangement should not be disrupted for equity and justice to prevail. According to him, the mutual respect and the unity of purpose within the Federal Constituency had been and will continue to be factors which will help the constituency to garner the highest number of votes among the nine Federal Constituencies in the state “Members of the party in Irepodun and Orolu local government council areas shall work days and nights to ensure a landslide victory, if not moon slide, for our dear party as well as the people’s governor, Alhaji Gboyega Oyetola in the forthcoming gubernatorial election in the state and other future elections. “We wish to point out that whoever thinks that the Osogbo/Olorunda will rob us by snatching the house of representatives ticket from us is nursing a motive that will destroy the peace and harmony of the largest Federal Constituency. We believed it is a rumour, but If the move is true, it will be unanimously resisted by all means and with anything at our disposal as an integral part of the Federal Constituency,” he said. While speaking, Osun State former Commissioner for Finance, Hon Remi Wilson, said that “it is “unholy act” exhibited by leaders and shareholders in Osogbo/Olorunda to have the Senate ticket together with the house of representatives ticket and leaving Irepodun/Orolu with nothing, adding that it can not be possible for them to rub our zone the opportunity to produce either Senator or member of the House of Representatives in the 10th National Assembly”. She continued, “we are entitled to either the Senate ticket or the House of Representatives ticket, we give them the privilege to choose which one they want, it is not possible for Osogbo/Olorunda to take what belongs to all of us, this can not be allowed to happen at all and if they don’t want Senate ticket again, people of Irepodun/Orolu are very ready to take it.” They, however, called Governor Gboyega Oyetola, Chief Bisi Akande and the Chairman, Osun APC, Prince Gboyega Famodun to intervene for things not to fall apart.
