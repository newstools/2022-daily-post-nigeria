The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has given the federal government a 21-day ultimatum to resolve the issues with members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Non-Academic Staff Union of Educational and Associated Institutions (NASU), Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Universities (SSANU), and National Association of Academic Technologist (NAAT). This was contained in a communique released on Wednesday and jointly signed by the NLC President, Ayuba Wabba, and the congress’ General Secretary, Emmanuel Ugboaja. After the meeting with the leaders of the affected unions, Wabba frowned at the government’s failure to honour its 2009 re-negotiated agreement with them. According to him, after the ultimatum expires, the NLC will decide on the next line of action if the government fails to resolve the impasse. “In light of the foregoing concerns, the meeting resolved as follows: “Called on the Federal Government to immediately set up a High-Powered Panel constituted of members with requisite mandates to resolve within 21 days the foregoing issues militating against industrial harmony in Nigeria’s university system; and “Pursuant to the foregoing resolution, the Nigeria Labour Congress would be convening a Special Meeting of the Central Working Committee (CWC) of all the Affiliate Unions of the Congress to decide on the next line of action.”
