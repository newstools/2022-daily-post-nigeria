Police in Anambra have arrested a man identified as a pastor and lecturer at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, for defiling a 12-year-old girl. Though Anambra State Police Command was yet to reveal the name of the suspect, a source told DAILY POST that the man, who is a pastor with a pentecostal church, is named Mr Onyekwelu. The pastor it was gathered was less than a week entrusted with the girl as a house help to help him out with house chores as his family was based in Abuja, but he turned her into a sex slave from the very first day of accepting her. Our source said: “Nobody knew what was happening until on Wednesday night, when the girl jumped down from the two-storey building they reside in, to escape rape after the man came to her to make advances. “She is currently in the hospital receiving treatment as she fractured her leg, after jumping down from the height. “We are calling for justice for the little girl, as she has been able to speak to some neighbours from her hospital bed, saying that from the very day she came to the man’s house, he started sleeping with her. “The girl said on Wednesday, after taking care of the house chores, she was about to go to bed when the man came again. She excused herself that she wanted to ease herself, and while the man was making phone call, she used the toilet window to jump down.” Meanwhile, the command said it has arrested the culprit. DSP Toochukwu Ikenga, the spokesperson of the command, who did not disclose the identity of the suspect said he was currently making a statement at the time he was contacted, assuring that he will send the full detail of the incident to journalists once it was ready. “The suspect is custody and investigation has begun please,” he added.
