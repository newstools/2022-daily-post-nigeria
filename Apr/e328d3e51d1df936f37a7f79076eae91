Brazil football legend, Ronaldinho, has agreed with Cristiano Ronaldo over who should be appointed Manchester United’s next permanent manager. Both men feel the head coach of Spain, Luis Enrique, should be appointed as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s replacement, the Daily Mirror reports. United appointed Ralf Rangnick on an interim basis, but his short-term deal runs out in June 2022. Although Erik ten Hag is the Red Devils’ preferred man and talks with the Ajax boss are ongoing, Ronaldo’s pick has long been Enrique. Ronaldinho was Enrique’s team-mate at Barcelona during the 2003/2004 season, allowing him to be up close and personal to one name on the Red Devils’ four-man shortlist. Enrique, reacting to the rumours during the international break, said: “I will be in Qatar with Spain because I have given my word and there is nothing that makes me more excited than representing my country in the World Cup; later, we’ll see.”
