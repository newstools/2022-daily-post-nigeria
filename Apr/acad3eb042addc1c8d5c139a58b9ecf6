Chelsea defender, Trevoh Chalobah, has named Timo Werner as the fastest player at the club. Chalobah said this ahead of Chelsea’s Champions League quarter-final tie with Real Madrid on Wednesday. He also revealed that Chelsea teammates call Werner ‘Timo Turbo’ because of his speed. Werner joined Chelsea from RB Leipzig for around €50m million in 2020. “I’m always working on my speed. After every game, when we get into training, it will be on the screen: the max speed we hit, the work rate, the speeds, the decelerations, everything. “My highest would probably be 34km/h. That is pretty quick, to be fair, but I think the highest is Timo Werner. “I think he’s got 36 or 37. ‘Timo Turbo’: that is what we call him,” Chalobah told FedEx’s Next in Line (via UEFA).
