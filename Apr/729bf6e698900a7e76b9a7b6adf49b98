A former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri, has insisted that Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi, will lose the race to run for the presidency in 2023. Omokri also slammed Amaechi, by claiming that the former Rivers State governor sold his brother to outsiders. He said this while reacting to Amaechi’s presidential declaration at the weekend. Amaechi declared his interest in succeeding President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. The minister made the announcement at a thanksgiving service organized by the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Rivers state on Saturday. “I stand before you today to declare my intention and submit my application to serve as your next President,” Amaechi announced. Reacting, Omokri, in a tweet via his Twitter handle on Saturday, said Amaechi was supposed to be in charge of rescuing the Nigerians who were recently abducted by terrorists in Kaduna instead of declaring for the 2023 presidency. He tweeted: “See the man who is suppose to be in charge of rescuing the over 100 Nigerians abducted by terrorists during last week’s Abuja-Kaduna train bombing! “Even in Rivers, Amaechi will lose, because when you sell your brother to outsiders, even your buyer won’t trust you.”
