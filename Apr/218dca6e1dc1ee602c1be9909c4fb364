A section of Nigerians have taken to social media to react to the declaration of presidential ambition by the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello. DAILY POST earlier reported that Bello in Abuja on Saturday, officially made known his intention to join the 2023 presidential race. But some Nigerians who reacted to the development, advised the governor to dash his ambition, saying he is not fit to lead the country. While some expressed shock at his move, others urged the Kogi governor to focus on fixing his state before nursing his ambition to occupy the office of president. Below are some of the reactions compiled by DAILY POST. @Sunnybatet: “He has not finished paying salaries and fixing all the terrible roads in Kogi, it is Nigeria he wants to handle. I don’t know what spirit that always deceives these politicians”. @Master4_jee: “That Nigeria needs a youth leader, not this type. He should run for the president of Afghanistan” @OyiboChijoke: “He has finally declared to run mad in 2023 together with his gullible and myopic supporters.” @ Majesty866: “I can’t believe this, does he think that Nigeria is Kogi State that he can be toying with anyhow he likes?”
