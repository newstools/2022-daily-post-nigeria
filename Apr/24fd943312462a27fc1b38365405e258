The Leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, has dismissed claims that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo betrayed Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, by declaring for the Presidency. Since Osinbajo declared his intention, individuals and groups from Tinubu’s camp have been describing the Vice President as a betrayal for making such a declaration knowing fully well that his political leader has the same ambition. However, Primate Ayodele said Tinubu is only experiencing nemesis due to some of the sins he has committed in the past. He said if Tinubu isn’t careful, a local, state and federal politician will betray him and he may lose Lagos State. In a statement signed by his Media Aide, Oluwatosin Osho, the clergyman said Tinubu had made people cry, hence will suffer for it. He said: ‘’Don’t blame Yemi Osinbajo for Tinubu’s political crisis, he has not realized it, he will later, they will keep him off the track completely. Tinubu is facing all of these because he also betrayed some people, the law of Karma is simply playing out. Osinbajo never betrayed Tinubu, He has done worse than these to people so I wonder what brought about the wailings. ‘’Tinubu has made people cry, he is just facing the same ordeal he put people through but unfortunately, instead of asking him to retrace his steps, his followers are deceiving him. God has given him Lagos but if he isn’t careful, he will lose the state and that will be worse. ‘’He has not seen anything, he better not put too much strength on the presidency rather he should return to Lagos if not, they will still betray him in Lagos. A local politician, state politician and federal politician will betray him, this is nemesis fighting Tinubu and it’s only God that can cancel it, he has not seen anything yet.’’
