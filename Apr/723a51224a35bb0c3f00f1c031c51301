Former Bulgaria striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has predicted some of the Premier League fixtures that will be played this weekend. Liverpool and Manchester City face tricky away trips as the title race enters its homestretch. At the bottom of the table, Burnley faces a crunch clash with Watford. On Newcastle v Liverpool, Berbatov told BetFair: “There’s a lot of pressure on Liverpool to get a result, but St. James’ Park isn’t an easy place to go. Prediction 2-2.” Champions Manchester City travels to Leeds, looking to set the pace ahead of Liverpool at the top of the table. “This is where you want something to happen, you want a result for the underdog, which would be a massive result for Leeds, but City is just too good. They have so much talent and they should get the job done here. Prediction 1-3,” Berbatov said. On Everton v Chelsea, he said: “I like Frank Lampard and I like the way he coaches, I would like to see them be safe. They will be ready for war in this game because they need the points and I predict a surprise. Prediction 1-0.” Arsenal currently occupies the last Champions League spot, two points ahead of rivals Tottenham Hotspur. Berbatov said: “This will be a good game. West Ham has a massive game in the Europa League next week, so I think they will be more focused on that, however, I can see it being a draw. Prediction 1-1.” The last game of this Game Week will see United welcome Brentford to Old Trafford. “This is one of those games that Man United should be winning. You have to win these games. Chances for a top-four spot are now very slim, but that doesn’t matter, they have to win this one at home. It’s a must-win. Prediction 2-1,” Berbatov said.
