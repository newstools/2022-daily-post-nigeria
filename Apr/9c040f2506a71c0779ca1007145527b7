Arsenal legend, Paul Merson has hailed winger, Bukayo Saka for the England international’s incredible form this season. Merson referred to Saka’s impressive stats that include ten goals and over five assists in 31 Premier League games. Saka netted from the penalty spot on Wednesday as Arsenal stunned Chelsea 4-2 at Stamford Bridge to increase their chances of finishing top four. “He’s [Saka] the bright spark for Arsenal, he’s the danger man and they don’t have a lot of danger men,” Merson said on Sky Sports. “The figures he’s putting up there are absolutely phenomenal. “When you put those types of figures up in a top, top team you know he’s a quality player. “He plays in a hard position on the football pitch. They [opposition defenders] double up on him,” he said. The Gunners are now level with fourth-placed Tottenham in the League table and welcome struggling Manchester United at the Emirates on Saturday as the battle for top four finish continues.
