The Jigawa State Command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps has warned passengers to avoid boarding vehicles outside motor parks, especially during the Sallah celebration. This was contained in a press statement signed by the Spokesman of the Command, CSC Adamu Shehu. He cautioned intending travellers to avoid boarding vehicles outside designated motor parks. Adamu explained that the Command has recorded several cases of passenger strangulations which resulted in deaths, injuries and more than a million Naira forcefully taken from victims. He said the Command had deployed 950 personnel to the 27 Local Government Areas of the State to provide maximum security before, during and after the Eid-el-Fitr celebration. Adamu urged members of the public to be security conscious, and enforce safety measures both at home and workplace before leaving for the holidays. He said the deployment will cover prayer grounds, recreational centres, motor parks, malls, and durbar routes among others. The State Commandant called on the general public to cooperate with his men by reporting any suspicious activity for appropriate action.
