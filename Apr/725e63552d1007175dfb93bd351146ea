Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State has reviewed the curfew imposed on the three municipal local government areas of Yola North, Yola South and Girei. The night curfew was imposed earlier following the activities of hoodlums and other miscreants using tricycles and motorcycles. “The curfew which was 10 pm to 5 am is now eased to commence from 11 pm to 5 am daily during the period of the Ramadan Fast and the review takes immediate effect,” a statement from Government House said. The statement, which was released to newsmen in Yola Wednesday by Mr Humwashi Wonosikou, the Press Secretary to Governor Fintiri, added, “The development is to enable the Muslim faithful to partake in tafsir sessions during the period.” The state government had in February 2021 imposed a night curfew on the three local councils through the Adamawa State Restriction of Movement of Tricycles/Motorcycles Executive Order No.1 of 2021. The order, meant to check excesses of hoodlums terrorising the areas, prescribed a sentence of six months imprisonment with an option of a fine or both in addition to forfeiting the offending tricycle or motorcycle. Following the current review of the curfew, Governor Fintiri directed security agencies to beef up security across the state, especially in the three councils of Yola North, Yola South and Girei by deploying more service personnel to keep watch, the statement from the Government House said.
