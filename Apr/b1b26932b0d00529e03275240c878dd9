Efforts to boost the transportation system in the nation’s capital may in the coming weeks, see the Federal Capital Territory Administration, commence construction works of 5.76 kilometers rail track. To this end, a total of $272million dollars has been budgeted as cost implication for the entire stretch of the 5.76 kilometers rail track. The Mandate Secretary, Transport Secretariat, Alhaji Zakari Dobi, made the disclosure while inspecting the vandalized light rail track, station and Idu training centre on Monday in Abuja. According to him, the secretariat is leaving no stone unturned to ensure we go back to site for the construction of 5.76 kilometers and fixing of the vandalized areas of the track. He was optimistic that the minister who has so much concern about the Abuja light rail project would quickly approve. “Two things informed this outing. Firstly, to be able to again evaluate and assess the level of vandalisation on the track. “Secondly, to also look at the training centre at Idu rail station with a view to being able to relocate some Departments of the Federal Capital Territory Administration Transportation Secretariat due to challenges of office spaces in Area 11. “What we saw was quite bad even though when I assumed office, I had been briefed about the issue of vandalisation. “We have intention to go back to site for the construction of a 5.76 kilometers rail track in Abuja. The cost of the construction also included fixing of vandalized areas. “We have seen some of the fresh areas that were vandalized and I want to believe that the projection made earlier on fixing the vandalized area will still accommodate what we saw,” he noted during the inspection exercise.
