President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday joined world leaders in welcoming the month of Ramadan, fasting and strong devotion for the Muslim faithful. In a message to Nigerians and Muslims around the world, Buhari said the period offers a special opportunity to “feel the hunger experienced by the poor so as to feel what it is like to be deprived and marginalized.” “Muslims,” Buhari emphasized, “should seek greater personal discipline, which is necessary for the realization of a great nation.” The President disclosed this in a statement by Garba Shehu, his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity. Buhari advised the Muslim elite against food waste and extravagant spending while others face hunger and destitution, urging that they should care for their neighbours, the poor and the marginalized. Buhari also called for prayers for peace in the country and beyond and for healing and harmony throughout the world. He also wished all Muslims a successful completion of the 30-day fasting period.
