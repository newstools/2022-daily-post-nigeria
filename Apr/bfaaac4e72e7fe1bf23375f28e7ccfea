Peter Nwachukwu, the husband of the late gospel artiste, Osinachi, has reacted to his wife’s death. Mr Nwachukwu disclosed that he is innocent of his wife’s death. Speaking from Police custody, the embattled husband denied battering and assaulting his wife while she was alive, Nation reports. Disclosing that his wife had been ill since November last year, Nwachukwu said: “I’m innocent.” Nwachukwu said he first took Osinachi to the Federal Medical Center (FMC), then to Gwagwalada General hospital, and then to the National Hospital, where she finally died. The embattled husband did not disclose the nature of her illness. Osinachi’s death has been linked to the domestic violence she suffered from her husband. Meanwhile, the Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen, had disclosed that Nwachukwu was secretly married to another woman.
