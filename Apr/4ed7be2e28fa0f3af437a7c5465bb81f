Unknown gunmen on Sunday set on fire the headquarters of Osu Local Government Area in Imo State. A resident of the area, who gave her name as Chibuzo Ukah, said the attack, which happened around 2:30am might be the handwork of the unknown gunmen troubling communities within the South East. She said several buildings, including the chairman’s office, administrative block and parked vehicles among others were among the facilities torched. Another community source, who pleaded anonymity, said Orsu is a no-go-area for the youths, especially young men because the activities of unknown gunmen are so rife in the area. He said just like Orlu where it is also alleged that it has become a haven for unknown gunmen, Orsu has turned into a dead zone for young men. The Interim Management Committee Chairman and Members of Orsu Local Govt Council Area, Hon Uchenna Osuigwe, when contacted, confirmed the incident saying , “the information you seek is already trending on Facebook and from what I was told, the fire damaged so many things. You know there is no way a fire will not damage something but the extent of the damage is being assessed. “So in due time, after a fact-finding exercise, we will come up with a comprehensive report on this.” Police spokesman in the state, Michael Abattam, when contacted for confirmation of the incident, denied any knowledge of it . He said, “Officially, I don’t know about it but let me confirm from the DPO in Orsu..”
