Paris Saint-Germain have identified Liverpool ace, Mohamed Salah, as the ideal replacement for Lionel Messi. According to Diario AS [via Fichajes.net], there are serious doubts about Messi’s future at the Parc des Princes with the Argentine possibly on his way out of the club at the end of the season. As a result, the Les Parisiens are reportedly preparing for life without Messi and have identified Salah as his replacement. Messi has not really impressed since he joined PSG from Barcelona last summer. The seven-time Ballon d’ Or winner was recently booed by PSG fans after their elimination from the Champions League at the hands of Real Madrid. Meanwhile, Salah has his contract with Liverpool expiring in 2023 and he is yet to agree to a new deal. The Egyptian captain is said to be happy at Liverpool, who he joined from AS Roma in 2017. However, the former Chelsea and AS Roma star is reportedly not happy with Liverpool’s latest contract offer and could thus be tempted by the prospect of joining PSG.
