Former Newcastle United manager, Graeme Souness, has questioned the appointment of Ralf Rangnick as Manchester United manager. Souness, who has managed clubs in the Premier League, including Newcastle United, queried how a club like Manchester United could ignore top managers in Europe, opting for Russian based Rangnick, who is widely seen as experienced. Manchester United dismissed club legend, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, after a series of poor results, to appoint Rangnick, who was working as a sports director at Locomotive Moscow, on an interim basis. The German is expected to stay at Old Trafford at the end of his six months contract and assume the role of the sports director. The Red Devils scraped past Norwich City on Saturday in a 3-2 victory thanks to a hat-trick from Cristiano Ronaldo. Even if United do manage to secure Champions League football next season, there has been no obvious change since the sack of Solskjaer. Writing in his column for The Times, Souness said: “I’d love to know why one of the world’s most prestigious clubs hired Ralf Rangnick from Russia. What made them think that he was a good fit? “Was Fergie asked for his opinion? It looked like a nice pension plan for Rangnick from day one and still does, as he’s set to stay as an adviser for two more years.”
