A Federal High Court, Abuja Division, presided over by Justice A. R. Mohammed, has dismissed the Application for Mandamus brought by one Chief Edozie Njoku and others, against the Ozonkpu Victor Oye-led leadership of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA). The trio of Chief Edozie Njoku, Barr Hamman Buba Ghide and Adamu Danjuma Musa had brought an Application for Mandamus vide Suit No. FHC/BAU/CS/10/2020: Chief Edozie Njoku & Ors v Independent National Electoral Commission, praying the court to compel Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to recognise him as the National Chairman of All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA). But the court held that the said suit constituted an abuse of court process and was an exercise in futility. The court further held that it lacked the jurisdiction to dabble into matters connected with the internal affairs of APGA. The Learned trial judge further stated clearly that he lacks the powers to sit on Appeal over the subsisting judgments of the Court of Appeal, Kano Division, as well as that of the Abuja Division. The court firmly asserted that the judgments of the Court of Appeal has laid to rest the issue of APGA leadership by affirming Ozonkpu Dr Victor Ike Oye as the National Chairman. Meanwhile, the National Chairman of APGA has hailed the judgement. Addressing newsmen after the judgement at the National secretariat complex, Oye expressed his unwavering confidence in the judiciary. This was contained in a release forwarded to DAILY POST on Thursday night. He stated that the judiciary had once again demonstrated that it is indeed the last hope of the common man and was firmly on the trajectory to rescue Nigeria.
