Manchester United midfielder, Bruno Fernandes, has spoken on manager Ralf Rangnick’s football style after the Red Devils’ costly 1-1 draw against Leicester City at Old Trafford on Saturday.
Hide quoted text Manchester United dropped more points in their pursuit of a top four place in the Premier League at home against Brendan Rodgers’ men. Nigeria International Kelechi Iheanacho put the Red Devils ahead, but Fred levelled for the home side moments later just past the hour-mark. The draw means United trail Arsenal by three points, having played two games more than the Gunners. But the Portugal international defended United’s German coach, saying it was not the manager’s tactics that cost them against the Foxes. When asked about Man United’s tactics the midfielder said: “It’s something we’ve done already against City and it worked really well in the first half,’ said Fernandes, according to Metro. “Today I thought it was working – we had chances and were compact. Leicester didn’t have many chances in the first half. It’s something that sometimes you have to use. It’s something that has to suit the team. “It’s not about one player or two. We have to be there for the team.”
