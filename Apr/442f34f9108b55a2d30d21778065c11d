The Imo West Senator, Ike Ekweremadu, on Saturday, said the southeast needs an extra state because the region is shortchanged. Ekweremadu explained that an extra state would enable the southeast to “match with the rest of the country in terms of opportunities and national assembly.” Speaking during a town hall meeting in Enugu State, the former Deputy Senate President, said the southeast is shortchanged in the area of resource control. Ekweremadu pointed out that the region stands at a disadvantaged position during voting and resource distribution at the National Assembly. According to Ekweremadu: “The number [in the national assembly] is lopsided, because of the way the states were created. “Right now, the south-east has just five states while others have six and seven. With the senate, we have just fifteen [lawmakers], while some have 18 and some 21. “So when it comes to voting and resource distribution, we are shortchanged. If you go to the house of representatives, [it’s a] similar thing. “I believe that the fair thing to do is for the country to agree for us to have an extra state for the south-east. So that will enable us to match with the rest of the country in terms of opportunities and national assembly.”
