Cristiano Ronaldo is among eight players that could leave Manchester United this summer. This claim was made by Former Manchester City right-back, Danny Mills. According to Mills, Ronaldo, Paul Pogba, Eric Bailly, Victor Lindelof, Phil Jones, Jesse Lingard, Juan Mata and Nemanja Matic could leave the Red Devils at the end of the season. Ronaldo has endured a difficult time at Manchester United since joining the Old Trafford club from Juventus last summer, despite scoring 22 times across competitions for the Premier League giants. Speaking on players that will leave Man United this summer, Mills told Football Insider that there is no point in making Ronaldo a part of the rebuilding process at Man United as Erik Ten Hag will take over from Ralf Rangnick. He said, “Pogba, Ronaldo, Bailly, Lindelof, Phil Jones, Lingard, Mata and Matic that is eight already, and that is without even thinking about it. Most of the contracts are up so it is very, very simple. “Ronaldo might be a difficult one, but I am sure somebody would take him. Remember they didn’t pay too much for him. It’s not like they are going to take a huge hit in terms of a transfer fee.” He added, “Ronaldo still has something to offer, but if you are talking about a rebuilding process, and he’s only going to be there for one season, what’s the point? He becomes more of a hindrance than a help. Every time you lose, it is ‘Why is Ronaldo not playing?’ That is the difficulty that you have. If you’re going to start afresh, give yourself that opportunity to start fresh.”
