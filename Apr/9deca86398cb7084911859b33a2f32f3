The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) insists the visit of the Chairman, Abdulrasheed Bawa to Justice Kazeem Alogba was a routine one. Bawa had met with Alogba, the Chief Judge of Lagos State, after a court session where he was a prosecution witness. EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren said the commission was constrained to state the fact of the visit to forestall innuendos and misrepresentation. His statement on Tuesday noted that there was nothing secret or clandestine about Bawa’s courtesy call. Uwujaren maintained the chairman’s visit was in official capacity and not as a witness in a criminal trial before the Lagos High Court. “The visit should not be exploited by mischief makers to fan the embers of disaffection between the Commission and members of the Bench”, the EFCC warned. The statement frowned at “the obvious design to draw a non-existent nexus between the visit and the ongoing case where Bawa has been in the witness box for over 5 years”.
