Real Madrid midfield maestro, Luka Modric admitted that he thought his side were “dead” having gone 3-0 down against Chelsea at the Bernabeu. The Croatian, however, said that support from their fans, the great substitutions made by the manager, Ancelotti and their experience in Europe’s elite competition, gave them the advantage over Chelsea. Chelsea went 3-0 up in the Spanish capital and were on their way into the semi-final of the Champions League, leading 4-3 on aggregate with Mason Mount, Rudiger and Timo Werner all getting on the scoresheet. However, Carlo Ancelotti’s men came back into the game after Luka Modric made a stunning assist, which Rodrygo fired in to send the match to extra-time. Karim Benzema ended Chelsea’s hopes, heading home to secure a 5-4 aggregate win. “It was unbelievable to describe this game,” Modric told the press after the game. “We were dead until the goal that we scored. I can’t say we played a bad game, but they used their chances well and scored three goals. “We kept believing and kept fighting and showed huge character. This stadium and the fans were very helpful with us. When we were losing 3-0, they were there supporting us. That gave us more boost to keep believing we could turn this around. “I think the master [Ancelotti] made great changes and they did well. In this competition, experience certainly plays an important role and today it helped us a bit. “We knew it would be tough, but in the end, we showed great character, desire and togetherness. It’s a defeat that is very sweet.”
