The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) on Saturday confirmed the safety of about 170 passengers that were onboard the attacked AK9 Abuja to Kaduna train on March 28. The NRCs Managing Director, Mr Fidet Okhiria, in a statement on Saturday, said the corporation was collaborating with relevant authorities to ensure the safety of the other passengers. Okhiria said 21 passengers are reported missing by the relatives who made calls to NRC but that human and material resources have been heavily moved to the accident site to ensure the resumption of train services without further delays. This, he said is to reduce the stress currently faced by its passengers in getting to their destinations. ”The corporation is seriously collaborating with the security agencies who had already swung into action, in line with the directive of Mr President to do everything possible to rescue all those that are still missing,” he said. ’ ‘In practical terms, a high powered restoration team, led by Directors have been working round the clock to re-rail the coaches affected by the bomb blast. ”There is a coordinated two-pronged simultaneous restoration approach. While Loco 2702 with re-railment and restoration materials departed Idu Station, Abuja, to the bomb blast site. ”Another team with Loco 2502 departed Rigasa Station, Kaduna, with re-railment and restoration materials to the same site. ”I am happy to inform you that as at the close of work on the 1st of April 2022, Coaches SP00004, SP00009, SP00012, SP00013 have all been re-railed and safely taken to our Rigasa Station in Kaduna. He added that restoration of tracks for full resumption of normal train services will continue today, 2nd April 2022 and arrangements for increased security along the track and onboard the train to prevent the recurrence of the unfortunate incident had been put in place.
