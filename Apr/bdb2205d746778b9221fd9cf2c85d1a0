Ajax manager, Erik ten Hag, has refused to rule out becoming Manchester United’s permanent manager this summer. Ten Hag is one of the favourites to replace interim manager Ralf Rangnick at Old Trafford next season. It is believed the Dutchman was interviewed for the role last month. Ten Hag has now played down the significance of the interview, saying it is a common occurrence to talk with other clubs. Speaking to Sport1, he said: “My focus is currently only on Ajax, but in football, you never know. “I don’t want to rule anything out. If at some point I decide to take the next step, I hope that people here will understand. “Everyone knows each other in the industry. There are always talks with representatives from other clubs, that’s normal. “Manchester United is a great club with great fans, but I can only repeat myself: my full focus is completely on Ajax! We are already planning for the new season.”
