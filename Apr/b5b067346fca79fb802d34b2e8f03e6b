The Lagos State government has shut down Medville Global Health Center at Ago Palace way in Okota area of Lagos State. This was taken after one Chibuike Nwachukwu accused the hospital of being responsible for the death of his wife during childbirth. The Executive Secretary of the Health Facility Monitoring and Accreditation Agency (HEFAMAA), Abiola Idowu, in a statement said preliminary investigations by the team disclosed that Medville hospital was not registered with HEFAMAA, and had inadequate personnel. Mr Nawchukwu claimed the hospital induced his wife to speed up labour but 10 hours after that, she had yet to give birth. He alleged that his wife died as a result of incompetence after a series of procedures were performed on her. He added that the baby is at the Intensive Care Unit of another hospital. Solanke Koya, chairman of the HEFAMAA board, has now ordered a full-scale investigation to uncover the facts surrounding the death of Nwachukwu’s wife. The agency noted that it made the “crucial decision” to shut the facility “in furtherance of public protection pending the final outcome of the ongoing investigations.”
