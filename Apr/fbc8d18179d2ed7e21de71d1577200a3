Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has said Champions League qualification would be a “game changer” for the club. Arteta also insisted they can still seal a top-four place despite a run of three successive defeats. Arsenal travel to Chelsea on Wednesday night seeking their first win in a month. The Gunners are also in sixth place on the table, three points behind North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, but with a game-in-hand. Arsenal are looking to play again the Champions League for the first time since 2016/2017. Arteta told ESPN: “Champions League brings the club much closer to where we want, to play in a competition that has a huge history in relation to our club. “Secondly, obviously it improves every situation with the sponsor, financially, expectations, the capacity to grow our players and expose them into a different dimension of competition and this is where we want to be. “It is a game changer. The Champions League pushes you there with the best teams in Europe and we definitely want to be there.”
