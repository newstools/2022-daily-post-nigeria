There was confusion on Sunday as members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun West protested the zoning formula adopted for the Osun West Senatorial ticket in the 2023 general elections. The party had adopted to zone the senatorial ticket in the district to Iwo. The commotion started when the party chairman for Osun West Senatorial District, Omolaoye Akintola, announced during a stakeholders meeting of the party that the ticket had been zoned to Iwo. The adoption made party members campaigning for the senatorial ticket be zoned to other federal constituencies in Osun West to disrupt the proceedings. They claimed that the party was acting out a script by zoning the senatorial ticket to Iwo which already had about eight contestants vying for the ticket. Reacting, they also maintained that the party leaders within the zone and in the state cannot impose any candidate on them. While insisting that it was the town of constituencies like Irewole and Ejigbo, the meeting was abruptly brought to an end. It was gathered that other candidates who were interested in contesting for the ticket are Ayo Omidiran, a former member of the House of Representatives, for Ayedade/Irewole/Isokan Federal Constituency. Recall that political appointees in Osun, including Dr Tadese Raheem, Commissioner for Water Resources and Energy; and Lateefat Giwa, Commissioner for Human Resources and Capacity Building; had resigned from the Osun State Executive Council. The duo, who both hail from the Osun West Senatorial District, is also vying for the Senatorial ticket of the APC in the 2023 general elections. The resignation was due to the directive of the state government to all political appointees interested in contesting the 2023 elections to resign.
