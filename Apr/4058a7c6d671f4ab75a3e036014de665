The police in Ogun State have set up a special operation squad following the recent cult clashes that have claimed about 15 lives in Abeokuta, Sagamu and other parts of the state in about one week. As President Muhammadu Buhari gave a marching order that those fomenting troubles in Ogun should be suppressed, the state police command said it is setting up the special operation squad to checkmate the activities of members of the unlawful cult groups and to tackle the problem headlong. The police spokesman in Ogun, Abimbola Oyeyemi, in a statement on Friday, disclosed that squad will be coordinated by the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Department of Operations. Oyeyemi disclosed that the squad “is saddled with responsibility of quick response to any cult related issues and will be operating 24 hours of the day.” According to him, the Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, had mandated them to fish out members of the trouble-making cult groups in any part of the state and deal with them in accordance with provisions of the law. While describing the activities of the cult groups as unacceptable, the CP directed the squad to clamp down on any known member of such groups. “The CP also warned parents and guardians to call their wards to order as the battle against cultists is going to be vicious in days to come. He equally warmed cultists in the state to relocate or ready to face the unimaginable onslaught that is going to be visited on them by the newly created squad and other conventional policemen in the state,” Oyeyemi stated. The CP had assured law-abiding citizens of their safety, urging to inform the police whenever they notice any strange gathering suspected to be that of cultists in their vicinity. He assured them that such information would be treated with utmost confidentiality.
