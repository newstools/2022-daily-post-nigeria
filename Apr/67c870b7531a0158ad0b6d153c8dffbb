Suleiman Jimoh, a resident of Alaguntan village, Orile-Owu, in Ayedaade Local Government Area of Osun State is now cooling his heels in police detention after he shot a 78-year-old man to death. Narrating his ordeal during the parade of the suspect at the Osun State Police Command in Osogbo, Jimoh confessed that he was on hunting expedition when he saw an object which supposedly looked like an antelope in the bush and he shot at it with his dane gun.
