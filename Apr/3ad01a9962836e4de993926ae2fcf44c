Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, said the squad needs some “more highly-talented and hungry” players this summer. Rangnick, speaking to Sky Sports ahead of Leicester City’s visit this Saturday, admitted that “it’s obvious something needs to be changed” at Old Trafford. The German replaced Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on a temporary basis last year and will move into an advisory role at the club at the end of this season. He has now spoken about United’s future plans as it concerns the recruitment of players. “It’s obvious that something needs to be changed, something needs to be rebuilt in the summer. “The team could do with some more highly-talented, hungry players who really want to develop their own careers. “I don’t think it should be that much about signing big names. I wouldn’t mind big names! But for me, it’s important about being competitive, hungry, seeing a move to a club not only as a big contract, a big-name club, but the next logical step in his career.”
