Bandits have attacked some houses at Anguwar Maji, Jere town, along Kaduna-Abuja highway, abducting 22 persons in the process. The invasion of the area by the bandits happened barely 24 hours after Usman Baba, the Inspector General of Police (IGP) paid a visit to the highway. A source, who confirmed the incident to DAILY POST, explained that the recent kidnapping took place in the night, on Sunday, around 11pm. According to him, the bandits came to the area in their large numbers, attacked some houses and went away with about 22 residents, including five women. He explained, “Some of the bandits wore security uniforms and attacked the villagers in their large numbers.” He added that they (bandits) moved from house to house and woke their victims up before they marched them into the bush at gunpoint, adding that the bandits operated silently in the community for over an hour. According to the source, the bandits started shooting sporadically while leaving the community with their victims. He stated that one of the 22 villagers kidnapped escaped from the abductors while they were leading them into the bush. Spokesman of the State Police Command, ASP Mohammed Jalige could not be reached when contacted. Jere, which shares a boundary with Tafa-Sabon-Wuse in Niger State, is located on the ever-busy Abuja-Kaduna highway.
