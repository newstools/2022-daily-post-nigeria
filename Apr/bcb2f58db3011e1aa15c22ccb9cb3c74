Amina Muaddi, a Fenty designer, has reacted to reports that she had an affair with ASAP Rocky. Reports had emerged on social media that Rihanna and her boyfriend, ASAP split because he cheated with Amina. Reacting, Amina in a statement on her Twitter page described the rumour as fake. She stated that the rumour was vile and fabricated with malicious intent. “In the last 24h, I’ve been reminded that we live in a society that is so quick to speak on topics regardless of factual basis and that nothing is off-limits. Not even during what should be one of the most beautiful and celebrated times in one’s life. “Therefore I have to speak up as this is not only directed towards me but it is related to people I have a great amount of respect and affection for. While Rih is continuing to live her serene, best dressed pregnancy life and I go back to my business – I wish everyone a beautiful Easter weekend!”
