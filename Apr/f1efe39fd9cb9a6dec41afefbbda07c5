A renowned Islamic cleric, Sheikh Dahiru Usman Bauchi, has decried the spate of increased killings across the country and called on the government to take proactive measures to bring an end to the general insecurity challenges affecting the nation. The Islamic Scholar made the call when a team of northern Nigerian Christians visited him at home for Ramadan iftar-aimed at fostering peace and unity among Nigerians. He emphasized the need for more prayers in the land to overcome the current insecurity challenges leading to the loss of lives and properties in the country. While calling on leaders to remember the judgement day, he urged Muslims and Christians to always live in peace and harmony and guard against provocations that may lead to the destruction of lives and properties. Earlier in his remarks, the leader of the delegation of Christian clerics from some parts of the 19 northern states of Nigeria under the leadership of Pastor Yohanna Buru said, the aim of joining the Muslim scholars in breaking Ramadan fast is to strengthen the Christian -Muslim relationship and promote better understanding among different faith-based organisations in Northern Nigeria and the country as a whole. Pastor Buru who is the General Overseer of Christ Evangelical and Life Intervention Ministry, Sabon Tasha, Kaduna, explained
that for the past 11 years, they have taken peace campaign during iftar to mix and interact with most Islamic scholars, including the Sultan of Sokoto, Abubakar Sa’ad, Sheikh Ibrahim Yakub El- Zazzaky, Sheikh Dahiru Bauchi, Sheikh Salihu Mai-Barota, Sheikh Mohammed ibn Abdul of Niger State, as well as to some neighbouring African countries like the Niger Republic and Benin Republics, with the aim of preaching and promoting peace and unity during iftar. He pointed out that Ramadan Iftar provides a golden opportunity for Christians to interact with Muslims to promote a better understanding among the adherents of the two religions.
