Manchester United are keen on making a shock move for Brentford playmaker Christian Eriksen, the Daily Star reports. The 30-year-old has been in splendid form since joining the Bees in the January transfer window. This has resulted in a fairytale return to the Danish international team, following his cardiac arrest during last year’s European Championship. It has also led to United showing an interest in signing Eriksen this summer. Ajax boss, Erik ten Hag, who was confirmed as the Red Devil’s new manager, is expected to bring in some new faces to improve a faltering United squad. It’s said that he has placed Eriksen on his transfer wishlist and believes he would be a perfect signing to launch his revolution at the Premier League giants. Ten Hag watched Eriksen up close when the player spent time training with Ajax, as he continued his recovery from his cardiac arrest and was left impressed.
