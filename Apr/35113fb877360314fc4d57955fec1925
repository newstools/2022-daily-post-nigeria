Sen. Bola Tinubu, a former Governor of Lagos State has said that Nigeria faces dangerous challenges because of some individuals who do not know the way of truth, love and goodness. Tinubu noted that some people have given themselves over to that which is bad and destructive. He said this in a statement signed by his media aide, Mr Tunde Rahman, on Saturday in Lagos while urging Muslim faithful and non-Muslims alike to renew and strengthen their faith and trust in God and His great mercy. The All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential hopeful also congratulated Muslim faithful in Nigeria and around the world on the commencement and observation of the holy month of Ramadan. “We beseech Almighty Allah to grant Nigeria special favour such that we become the just, prosperous and harmonious society he intends for us to be. “That each of us in our own humble way contributes to the wellbeing of those around us, give succour to people we find in need and study more how to solve problems instead of creating them,” he said “Our nation is one gifted by Allah with bountiful resources and a good and decent people. Yet, we also face serious and dangerous challenges because of a small few who know not the way of truth, love and goodness. “These people have given themselves over to that which is bad and destructive. We shall not be made despondent by the wrongs; these people do not be defeated by them,” Tinubu said.
