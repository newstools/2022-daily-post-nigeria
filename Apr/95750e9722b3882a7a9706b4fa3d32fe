Former Tottenham Hotspur and Aston Villa right-back, Alan Hutton, has urged Liverpool to sign Bayern Munich’s Serge Gnabry as Mohamed Salah’s replacement at Anfield. Salah currently has less than 18 months remaining on his current contract with Liverpool. The 29-year-old is yet to sign a new deal with Liverpool as there have been no advancements in contract negotiations between both parties. And Hutton believes Gnabry will fit in Jurgen Klopp’s squad, adding that he is a great alternative to Salah for Liverpool if the Egyptian international happens to leave the Premier League giants in the near future. Speaking to Football Insider, Hutton said, “Of course, he [Gnabry] would fit into that Liverpool squad no problem. “He’s obviously very technical, he understands, he’s had a good upbringing the last few years at Bayern Munich. I just like what Liverpool are doing at the moment, who they are looking at recruitment-wise. Younger, hungry players, but also they have proved it on big stages as well.” He added: “They are really moving forward. You need a plan A and a plan B. If A doesn’t work, you need to be ready to bring somebody in. If Salah does happen to leave, they will need a replacement through the door. They are doing their work behind the scenes at the moment, sounding people out. Who could come in and slot into this formation? “He’s definitely one of them. We have seen it on Champions League nights what he gives and what he can do. It doesn’t surprise me that a team like Liverpool are looking at him.” Gnabry joined Bayern Munich from Werder Bremen back in 2017. The German international is in a similar position to Salah. Gnabry also has less than 18 months remaining on his current contract.
