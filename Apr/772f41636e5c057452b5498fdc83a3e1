Former Minister of Steel, Wantaregh Paul Unongo, has expressed regret for spearheading President Muhammadu Buhari’s presidential campaign in 2015. Unongo said that he was among those who risked their lives to support Buhari’s presidential ambition seven years ago. The former chairman of the Northern Elders Forum, NEF, however, expressed disappointment with the performance of the Buhari government so far, adding that history will judge him when he finally leaves office in 2023. In a chat with journalists on Sunday evening in Jos, Unongo said: “Some of us that went for Buhari risked our lives. Many of us are disappointed, and I am too old not to speak the truth. We are disappointed with the performance we have seen by the government led by Buhari. “He could have done better, but he didn’t do as we expected him to. History will judge that he has total support from his people; some of them took a risk. I took the risk of leading a delegation to the United States of America (U.S.A.) to plead his cause because of what he had done in the past.” He added, “I addressed the Congress for General Buhari. So, what we are doing is not different from the role we played in the past.”
