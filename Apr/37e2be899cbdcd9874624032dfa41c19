Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has warned criminals that there is no place to hide in any part of the state. Makinde made this disclosure on Friday. The governor spoke during the handing over of 100 operational vehicles fully equipped with communication gadgets to the Western Nigerian Security Network, also known as Amotekun. Makinde speaking at an event held at Agodi, Ibadan, admitted that some people only come into the state with criminal intentions. He, however, warned that security agents in the state will get anyone who intends to make trouble in the state. Makinde explained that apart from the 1,500 personnel currently engaged by the outfit, more than 500 persons will be recruited to further strengthen its capacity in the state. “To criminals and criminally-minded individuals, I was told that they usually import criminal elements into Oyo State. “Well, we have the security vehicles but that is not the only thing we are doing. We are recruiting more Amotekun personnel and would be upgrading their communication structure. “We are also equipping them so that they can respond to you adequately. “So, my advice is, when you come to Oyo State with the intention to carry out any criminal activity, there is nowhere to hide. We will get you, deal with you and it will be your last operation. So, please, stay off Oyo State.”
