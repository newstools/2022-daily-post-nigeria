Clerics of the Interfaith Alliance in Kaduna have protested regular bandits’ attacks in various parts of the State. DAILY POST recalls that Kaduna has been in the news for the past few weeks due to constant bandits’ attacks in various parts of the State, leading to the killing and kidnapping of several people. Bandits had attacked Kagoro community, in Kaura Local Government Area of the State, killed several people and abducted many others. Few days later, they stormed nine communities in Giwa Local Government Area, killed several people, kidnapped scores, among other attacks. Following this development, the clerics staged a peaceful protest, calling on the Federal Government to urgently salvage the situation. Reverend Emmanuel Adebayo, convener of the group, lamented the suffering by victims of banditry, praying God to help them overcome the psychological trauma they passed through during the attacks. The pastors with the hashtag: #Kadunaprays, called on the Federal Government to be proactive in tackling terrorism.
