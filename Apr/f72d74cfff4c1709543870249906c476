Manchester United midfielder, Bruno Fernandes, has identified the major difference between the Red Devils and Liverpool. Fernandes said Liverpool are ready for the Premier League title while Man United are not, adding that Ralf Rangnick’s side needs to look at themselves. The Portugal international said this while speaking on the difference between his team and Liverpool following their 4-0 Premier League defeat to Jurgen Klopp’s side on Tuesday night at Anfield. Liverpool thrashed Man United following goals from a brace from Mohamed Salah and a goal each from Luis Diaz and Sadio Mane. Speaking after the game, Fernandes was asked what he thinks are the main differences between Man United and Liverpool at the moment and the midfielder told Sky Sports: “The fans don’t deserve us to play this way. They deserve more from us. “The way they stay and applaud us, they deserve more. We have to raise our level higher. It is what it is. “I think everyone runs. I think there is an effort from everyone. I don’t think someone does not give 100%. We have to do it for ourselves, the clubs, the fans and everyone. “We have to say things, but that is kept in the dressing room. Now it is over, we have to think of the next game. “Liverpool is ready for the title. We are not. I don’t need to be here saying about the difference in the level. We have to look at ourselves, from top to bottom and understand what is going wrong. “We are competing until the end. Nobody can put down and think it is over. We have something to fight for.”
