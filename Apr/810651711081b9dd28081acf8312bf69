A former Ekiti State governor, Ayodele Fayose has made it clear that he will not drop his presidential ambition for any aspirant in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Fayose stated this during an interview on Channels Television on Wednesday. He also insisted that the PDP must zone its presidential ticket to the South. “I don’t believe in not zoning this presidential ticket. I was a member of the zoning committee except for the last day that I picked up my form. “All they said was ‘because the party ought to have started the process a long time, for reasons on the fact that some people have bought forms, maybe the party can find a way to work around consensus’. They never made that statement (on throwing the presidential ticket open). “Let me say to you, the only solution is zoning. The north can’t contest the last primary — the one we had in Port Harcourt which was an all northern affair — and come and tell us that there won’t be a southern affair,” Fayose said. Fayose also said he will only accept the consensus option if he gets the nomination. He said: “I saw the people going around for consensus. Who will step down for who? You asked me to step down? I won’t step down. “They said they want all of us to come and do consensus. I don’t know about them. I have taken my form today. I am not going to step down. “Who knows if it is me that Nigerians want to vote for? Do you know the mind of Nigerians? Do you know who they want? Any meeting or anywhere they talk about consensus, as good as that language looks, it is undemocratic.”
