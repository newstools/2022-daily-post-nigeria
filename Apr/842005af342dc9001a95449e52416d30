Nobel laureate, Wole Soyinka has revealed what he would do during the 2023 general elections. According to the playwright, it is very likely he would just take French leave of the elections and just watch the results. As the 2023 elections draw near, Soyinka said he might be a spectator, describing the country’s political scene as “turbid”. “So, very likely, all I would do is take French leave from the elections and just watch the results,” he said. Soyinka said this at a press conference in Lagos on Thursday, berating the two leading political parties in the country, the All Progressives Congress, APC, and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, whose members cross-carpet at the slightest provocation. Soyinka slammed the most popular parties for the gale of defections, saying that it was now difficult to distinguish between both political parties. “Look at the two major parties, there has been such cross over from one rivulet to another, each crossing having its own purpose, that it is getting difficult to even distinguish between the two major parties,” Soyinka added.
