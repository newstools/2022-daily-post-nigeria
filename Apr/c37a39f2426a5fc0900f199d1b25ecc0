A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress in Rivers State, Senator Magnus Abe says it is not true that President Muhammadu Buhari has nominated his successor ahead of the 2023 presidential election. He was reacting to rumours that the Minister of Transport Chibuike Amaechi has been nominated by the President to succeed him. Senator Abe also described as “premature” the ongoing jubilation by some members of the All Progressives Congress in Rivers State that the Minister has been nominated to replace the president. The former federal lawmaker was speaking while addressing some members of the APC in Port-Harcourt on Monday. According to Abe: “When you get up and nothing has happened, then you make yourself very happy. It is called premature ejaculation. That is what is happening in the All Progressives Congress here in Rivers State. “Nothing has happened, people are already making themselves happy. They are going around telling people that President Buhari has appointed his successor. I am a member of the All Progressives Congress, I want to stand here and tell you people that I am not aware that the president has nominated anybody to be President. Nobody and that is not what I think is the plan of this party. “The plan of this party is to ensure that party members will have the opportunity to pick who will succeed President Buhari as the flag-bearer of the party”. He said in a few months to come, all the noise by some members of the party would cease. He encouraged members of the party to continue their grassroots mobilization in the interest of the party ahead of the election.
