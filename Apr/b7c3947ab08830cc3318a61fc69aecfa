Simon Ekpa, a self-acclaimed disciple of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu, has reacted to alleged moves by some groups of herders who threatened to attack and takeover Igboland. IPOB had alleged that the herders are planning to invade the region to take over the land as allegedly done in some other parts of the country. Spokesman of the secessionist group, Emma Powerful, while reacting to the threat, said they are not bothered by their threat, saying the region is not like other places they claimed to have conquered. Similarly, Ekpa in a tweet on his official Twitter handle, said the Igbos only believe in actions, saying “Nigerian news will tell the story”. He said, “Those expecting us to respond to Fulani terrorists threat of invading Igbo-Biafra community should understand that we are now in the era of action. Those responding to such threats are seeking relevance. Gone are the days we complain. Let them come, NIG news will tell the story”.
