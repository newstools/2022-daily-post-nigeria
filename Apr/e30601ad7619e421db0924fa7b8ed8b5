Governor Samuel Ortom and his Deputy, Engineer Benson Abounu, on Saturday, April 23, joined other dignitaries to witness the burial of Mrs. Judith Obla, wife of former chairman of Otukpo LGC, Chief Godwin Obla (SAN). In his funeral oration, Governor Ortom poured encomiums on Mrs. Obla, describing her as his personal friend and a woman who related well with everyone, irrespective of their political affiliations. The Governor, who stated that both the Obla family and the entire state would feel the vacuum that has been created by her demise, however, expressed hope that God would give her loved ones the heart to bear the pains. He said that the presence of members of leaders of various political parties in the state is a sign how the family of Chief Obla lived a life by impacting others in the society.  Earlier in his sermon, Reverend Innocent Oyifioda, who described death as the beginning of another world where every individual shall receive God’s judgement, urged Christian’s to always be ready when God would call them back and in order to gain eternity. Reverend Oyifioda called on all to live with eternity in mind by impacting lives of humanity. The burial ceremony which took place at Ogobia, Ugboju in the Otukpo Local Government area was also attended by the Senator representing Benue South Senatorial District, Senator Abba Moro and other top political, military and the legal professions.
