A group, Niger Delta Youth Movement, NDYM, has called on the presidency to gather the political will to tackle persistent banditry, kidnapping in Nigeria, especially in the northern part of the country. It also lamented the proliferation of firearms in the Niger Delta region ahead of the 2023 elections, even as it tasked the security agencies to be on the alert. The group made the call at the wake of bombing and killing of passengers on the Kaduna/Abuja train, as well as the invasion of Kaduna International Airport by terrorists. These were contained in a communique signed by the National President, Comrade Amutadi Tega and the Secretary, Comrade Ediagbonya Joshua, issued to journalists in Uyo on Saturday. According to the statement, “we condemn the bombing and killing of passengers on the Kaduna/Abuja train and the invasion of Kaduna International Airport by terrorists. We urge the Presidency to summon the political will to stem this vicious cycle. “NEC calls on all security agencies and indeed the entire citizenry to be very vigilant and proactive against proliferation of firearms in the region as a prelude to the forthcoming 2023 general elections.” Speaking on the 2023 elections, the group said for the sake of peace in Nigeria, the presidency should be zoned to the southern part of the country as earlier proposed by the Southern Governors and the Middle Belt Forum. It also called on the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) to partner relevant agencies within and outside Nigeria in giving assistance to Ukrainian returnees from the region. The communique added that following the controversies surrounding the Permanent Voters Card, the INEC should intensify local sensitization of youths on electoral processes, such as electronic voting and should ensure that election rigging staff were prosecuted.
