Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has said Real Madrid have a physical edge over his men. The Blues have played 22 matches already in 2022, while their LaLiga rivals have played 20. Also, LaLiga allows five substitutions per game, but the Premier League only approved the rule for next season and currently allow three. “First of all, we wanted it more physical but we need not work hard or intense enough in the first match. “Second of all, we face a huge disadvantage in terms of physicality because Real Madrid has a whole year with five changes and we play the most demanding league, we play the most matches throughout the season and throughout 2022 so it is not always easy to play a physical game. “We are a team that needs the physicality, the sharpness, the commitment and the investment to be a special team,” Tuchel said. Chelsea travel to the Bernabeu with a 3-1 deficit to overturn, if they must make it to the Champions League semi-final.
