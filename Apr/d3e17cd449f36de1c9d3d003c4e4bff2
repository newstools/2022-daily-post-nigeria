Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has said that goalkeeper, Edouard Mendy, qualified for the 2022 World Cup with Senegal but could not help the Blues as they lost 4-1 against Brentford in a Premier League tie on Saturday. A brace from Vitaly Janelt and a strike each from Christian Eriksen and Yoane Wissa gave Brentford all three points against Chelsea. Antonio Rudiger did score for Tuchel’s men at Stamford Bridge. Speaking during his post-match press conference, Tuchel said Chelsea’s match against Brentford was an unthankful game for Mendy. He said, “Actually, I have to watch it again. I think it is an unthankful game for a goalkeeper. Also, for him, he has a lot to process. “That is why he goes and plays these tight matches – a rematch of the African Cup final to qualify for the Qatar World Cup. “He does another penalty shootout and he can feel it. He is part of the team and unfortunately, he couldn’t help us as he did in the first match.”
