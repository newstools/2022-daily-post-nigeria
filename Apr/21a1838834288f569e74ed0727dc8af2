The Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Mathew Kukah, on Sunday said President Muhammadu Buhari has destroyed every aspect of life in the country but has allowed corruption to thrive and grow. Bishop Kukah said this in an Easter message to his congregation in Sokoto state, adding that Nigeria has become one big emergency national hospital with full occupancy and the government seems to be on hibernate mode. “With everything literally broken down, Our hearts are broken. Our family dreams are broken. Homes are broken. Churches, Mosques, and infrastructure are broken. Our educational system is also broken. “Our children’s lives and future are broken politics, economy, energy system is also broken. Our security system is broken. Our roads and rails are broken. Only corruption is alive and well,” he said. According to him, “Nigerians can no longer recognize their country which has been battered by men and women from the dark womb of time.” He noted that the real challenge is not how we got here but how to climb out of this situation. “One would be tempted to ask, what is there to say about our tragic situation today that has not been said? Who is there to speak that has not spoken? Like the friends of Job, we stare at an imponderable tragedy as the nation unravels from all sides. “The government has slid into hibernation mode. It is hard to know whether the problem is that those in power do not hear, see, feel, know, or just don’t care. Either way, from this crossroad, we must make a choice, to go forward, turn left or right or return home. None of these choices are easy, yet, guided by the light of the risen Christ, we can reclaim our country from its impending slide to anarchy,” he added.
