Popular music star, Simi Ogunleye, aka Simi, has weighed in on the death of ‘Ekwueme’ singer, Osinachi Nwachukwu. Osinachi’s death was announced on Friday night after reportedly battling cancer. However, it was later alleged that the singer died in the hospital after suffering domestic violence from her husband. Reports also had it that Osinachi refused to leave the marriage despite domestic violence because of her commitment to the church. Reacting, Simi advised women to leave abusive relationships. “You have no business staying in a physically abusive relationship. However we don’t talk enough about people that stay because they don’t know where to go or how to go. Because everyone they know is encouraging them to stay. Empowerment is more accessible for some than others. “I’ve heard of women that stay because when they ran to their families, they sent them back. ‘This marriage. Make it work.’ “Like I can’t get it out of my head how she knew she was suffering. Her friends knew she was suffering. She worked, so she could afford to leave and sustain herself – but she stayed. Why? What happened. It’s inconceivable to me that there’s no reason. “And if there is one, it’s unbelievable how it was reason enough,” she said.
