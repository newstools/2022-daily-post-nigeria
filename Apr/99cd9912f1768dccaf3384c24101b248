The sum of N44.2 million got missing on Wednesday at the national secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The development led to the abrupt end to the sale of forms, especially for the Senate and House of Representatives over the sudden disappearance of the N44.2 million. The party had put up a canopy where the forms for Senate and House of Representatives were being sold to prospective aspirants. But around 4:15p.m, the canopies were removed by the party and it directed the staff to continue the sale of forms at the International Conference Centre, Abuja. DAILY POST equally gathered that due to the inability of the security agents at the party secretariat to control the crowd, the party chairman, Senator Abdulahi Adamu directed that the staff selling National Assembly forms should move to the International Conference Centre (ICC). It was further gathered that the development may not be unconnected with the sudden disappearance of $75, 000, which is equivalent to N44.2 million. A staff of the party, who pleaded anonymity, said the canopies were removed after it was discovered that the money was missing. The source said: “We heard that someone came to the party secretariat today, but because of the crowd, he could not come into the secretariat with his car. But while struggling to find his way into the secretariat, we learnt that the $75,000 he was holding inside an envelope fell.” However, the party would continue the sale of governorship and presidential forms at the party secretariat to be able to control the crowd.
