Dotun Babayemi, a gubernatorial aspirant during the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) primary election in Osun State has insisted that he is not disturbed by the list released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the Saturday, July 16, Osun gubernatorial polls. Babayemi, while maintaining that he has unshakable faith in the ongoing legal process, also assured that the will of the people would prevail and he would be vindicated at the end of the day. Babayemi reacted to the INEC’s list through a statement issued by Kayode Oladeji, the Director, Media of his campaign organisation. He noted that the list released was a product of a calendar of a defined process, which could not be termed final. He pointed out that by INEC’s timetable, June 16, 2022, is the last day for publication of the final list of nominated candidates by the Commission. Babayemi clarified that, “There is nothing final about the list and I am sure that somebody somewhere knows that. It is only the uninformed that can think it is the end of the process, because it is on INEC’s timetable; the list published is just the submission by various parties. “Fortunately, there is a window of opportunity provided by the new Electoral Act and that is what we are exploring because we believe in the rule of law. Everything you are seeing are tailor-made processes which are amenable to changes when the need arises on account of judicial pronouncements.” He explained that INEC as an agency of government respects the rule of law and would act accordingly when the court makes its pronouncements on the issues at hand. While appealing to the PDP members in the State to remain calm and not take laws into their hands, he assured the citizens of the State that he would triumph at the court.
