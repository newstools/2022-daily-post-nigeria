Pastor David Ibiyeomie of Salvation Ministry, Port Harcourt has identified fake age declarations as the major problem of Nigerian footballers. The clergy, who spoke during the church’s mid-week service on Wednesday, said unlike the 37-year-old Manchester United player, Ronaldo, some Nigerian players who claim to be 32 are already tired. He alleged that a footballer who is a twin claimed to be 31-year-old when his twin brother celebrated 42 years. He said, “Most Nigerian footballers keep reducing their age and when they say that they are 32, they can’t run again but Ronaldo is still running at 37. They can’t run again because that is not their true age, the man is already in his 40s. “There was a Nigerian footballer I won’t call his name, he is a twin from his name you will know he is a twin, they have the way they call their names. “Now, his own twin brother was already 42 when he was 31, so I wonder how they were twins so he retired early at 31, 32 he retired, because there was no way he could run, Messi mate cannot play football again”.
