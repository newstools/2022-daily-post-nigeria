Barcelona president, Joan Laporta, has promised that the club will change its ticket policy for European games. This comes after around 30,000 Frankfurt fans gained entry into Camp Nou for Thursday’s Europa League game. Frankfurt were allocated 5,000 tickets for the match by Barca, but thousands more secured seats in the home end to watch the Bundesliga club stun Barca 3-2 and book their place in the semi-finals. “We feel really bad, it was shameful,” Laporta told Barca’s website on Friday. “I am appalled by the image presented and feel ashamed as this should never have happened. “The club is not guilty regarding events leading to the tickets ending up in the hands of German fans. However, we do accept the responsibility that falls on us. “We do not want this to happen again at Barca and we will take action: the measures that I can announce for now — and that will be adopted for all international competitions — is that tickets will become non-transferable. “It is something we never wanted to do because it is inconvenient for fans who follow the rules. But we have no option to ensure that what happened against Frankfurt does not happen again.”
