Famous gospel artiste, Frank Edwards has said he is ready to put his weight behind the case involving the death of Osinachi Nwachukwu. The ‘Ekwueme’ singer was confirmed dead on Friday night. Hours after her death, reports emerged that the singer suffered domestic violence and was beaten by her husband which landed her in the hospital. Frank Edwards, who had earlier reacted to her death, went on Instagram live expressing sadness about Osinachi’s death. The singer said although he has never taken anyone to court or locked anyone up, he is ready to follow this case up. He urged those suffering from domestic violence to leave their relationships or marriage before considering any other action. Frank Edwards said: “I have never pulled my weight against anybody even people who hurt me I’ve never done it. “I’ve had reasons to take people to court but I didn’t but this case cannot go like that because this is a colleague and a voice that was blessing the world. “If you are being physically abused, leave first.”
