The Osun State Police Command had disclosed that investigations have commenced to unravel the circumstances surrounding the death of Abiola Afolabi Olamide. It also promised to make the outcome of the investigation public to assuage the members of the public. This was made known by Olawale Olokode, the Commissioner of Police, Osun State, in a press release signed by Yemisi Opalola, the Command’s spokesperson and made available to DAILY POST on Monday in Osogbo. Olokode, who urged members of the public and the youths to believe in the police and allow for justice to take its course, added that he had met with the State government and representatives of Civil Societies Organisations in order for justice to be done on the matter. While calling on the youths, individuals and groups who were still planning to embark on protest to jettison the idea, the Osun police boss called on members of the public to go about their lawful duties. He assured that the police would not relent in discharging its constitutional responsibility of protecting lives and properties.
