Another Russian General, Vladimir Petrovich Frolov, has been killed in the Ukraine-Russia war. Frolov, who was the Deputy Commander of the 8th army of Russia’s armed forces, died in the war in Ukraine, the Russian news agency TASS reported on Sunday. Frolov’s death was confirmed by St Petersburg governor Alexander Beglov. Beglov said: “Vladimir Petrovich Frolov died a heroic death in battle with Ukrainian nationalists.” He added that Frolov “sacrificed his life so that children, women and the elderly in the Donbas would no longer hear bomb explosions. To stop waiting for death and leaving home, to say goodbye as if it were the last time.” Recall that Russian Lieutenant-General, Yakov Rezantsev, was killed in Ukraine last month. The war between Russia and Ukraine began in February this year. Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered the invasion of Ukraine over disagreements on some political issues. As of today, several casualties have already been recorded as a result of the war.
