Imam, Nuhu Khalid who was recently sacked by the committee of a mosque at Apo Legislative Quarters, Abuja has vowed to always speak up on the state of the nation. DAILY POST recalls that the Imam had in his sermon, lamented the security situation and disregard for human lives by government officials, stating that the high level of insecurity in the country is because of the collective failure of Nigerian leaders, particularly President Muhammadu Buhari. The committee of the Mosque which found the sermon offensive, suspended him on Friday last week and finally terminated his appointment on Monday. Speaking with Channels TV, the sacked Imam opined that he was not wrong to demand security for the nation citing the recent attacks in Kaduna State. He said he was ready to go to hell if talking to power regarding the state of security in the nation is a sin, saying the leaders need to fix the nation’s security. He said, “I said President Muhammadu Buhari was supposed to have done more than what he did. And I said if they are only concerned with voting in elections, then will we give them conditions for our votes. And the condition is, secure Nigeria before 2023 or we will not vote again. “All we want is security and if it is a sin to ask for that, then I am ready to go to hellfire. But I am aware that it is not a sin to ask for a secured Nigeria”.
