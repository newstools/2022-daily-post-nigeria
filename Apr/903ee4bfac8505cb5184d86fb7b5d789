A former Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, Victor Umeh, has insisted that it is an injustice for the South-East region of the country not to produce Nigeria’s President in 2023. Umeh said this during an interview with Channels Television’s Politics Today, on Monday. As President Muhammadu Buhari, who hails from Katsina State, completes his two-term constitutional tenure by 2023, there have been demands by the southern governors for the presidency to be zoned to the region. DAILY POST had reported that the governors from Southern states of the country jointly agreed that its region must produce the next President. Precisely, most easterners want the South-East region to produce President Buhari’s successor in 2023. “It is an injustice,” Umeh said. “South-East has never produced a President for Nigeria. “Nobody from the South-East has been President, it is the turn of the South to produce a President now. “The way we have shared power over the years, you will see that the South-West has produced a president through Obasanjo democratically for eight years, now they have the vice president standing out for eight years with Buhari, then the South-South has produced President through Jonathan who has been there for nearly six years,” he added.
