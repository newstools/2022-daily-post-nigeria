Real Madrid goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois has sympathised with Edouard Mendy of Chelsea following the Senegalese’s error which allowed Benzema to complete his hat-trick in first leg of their Champions League quarter-final at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday. Karim Benzema scored two brilliant headers to give the 13-time European champions a two-goal lead after 24 minutes. But through much struggles, Kai Havertz managed to pull a goal back for Chelsea. A mix-up between Blues’ goalkeeper Mendy and defender Antonio Rudiger shortly after the restart then led to Benzema’s third goal of the night. Speaking about the mistake by Mendy, Courtois told BT Sport, “Yeah, that’s unfortunate. “There are things that happen unfortunately in football for us goalkeepers, you miss a pass there’s no one behind you who can save it. “He gave Chelsea a lot of points last year, he helped them to win the Champions League, so I don’t think they will blame him too much. “I understand for him it will be a hard evening, but he will bounce back.”
