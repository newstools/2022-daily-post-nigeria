Real Madrid striker, Karim Benzema has explained his “mental confidence” behind taking a Panenka penalty in their 4-3 defeat to Manchester City on Tuesday. Benzema struck twice at the Etihad in their Champions League semi-final first leg. One of the key moments came after Aymeric Laporte was punished when the ball struck his arm in the area. Benzema converted the penalty with a cheeky ‘Panenka’ chip down the middle to make the score 4-3, eight minutes from the end. This came after the in-form Frenchman missed two penalties in Real Madrid’s last game with Osasuna. “I always have it in my head that if you don’t take a penalty, you will never miss a penalty. “That’s mental confidence and that’s all. I have a lot of confidence in myself… so I do it and it turns out well,” Benzema said.
