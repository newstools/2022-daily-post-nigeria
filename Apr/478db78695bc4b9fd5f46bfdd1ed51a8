Former Anambra State Governor, Peter Obi has condemned the killing of over 100 people in Plateau State and more than 20 individuals in Benue State. The 2019 Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) vice presidential candidate described the massacre as horrific and unacceptable. Obi noted that the degree of the killings questions the government’s responsibility to protect lives and properties. “Nigeria must cease being a killing field. These numbers are human beings and loved ones of many families”, his statement Wednesday night reads. “As a nation, we cannot be insensitive to the ongoing bloodletting and targeting of the most vulnerable and helpless in our society,” he added. He said such security measures must be proactive and holistic, especially in areas close to ungoverned rural and urban communities. Obi conveyed his thoughts and prayers with the families of the victims of the wicked acts. Reacting to the killings, President Muhammadu Buhari had declared that the sponsors and perpetrators must not be forgiven.
