Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel has told his striker, Timo Werner to start ‘helping himself’ at the club. The German gaffer said this following the player’s brace in Chelsea’s 6-0 win over Southampton on Saturday. Werner has really struggled to make any impact at Stamford Bridge since his £47.5 million move from RB Leipzig in 2020. The German striker’s poor form led to the signing of Romelu Lukaku from Inter Milan last summer. Werner has scored just three goals in the Premier League this season and has been unable to secure a regular role in the team despite Lukaku struggling for form. Ahead of Chelsea’s Champions League clash with Real Madrid, Tuchel was asked if he has spoken to the striker to motivate him, and the former PSG boss said, “Yeah, but it would have been a long talk from October until April. “At some point there are no words, you must help yourself. You sign for Chelsea, you sign for a top club, you have to live up to it and accept the pressure that comes with it. And you also have to help yourself. “It means when you come on the pitch, you have to be ready when the chance comes.”
