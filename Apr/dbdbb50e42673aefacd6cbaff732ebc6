The four bidders looking to buy Chelsea Football Club have been given until next week to present their final bids to buy the club, according to Sky News. The initial deadline to make improved offers was set for Monday, but it has now been pushed back by “a small number of days”. The prospective buyers were informed after the Blues lost 3-1 to Real Madrid on Wednesday, that they would need to submit binding takeover proposals before next week ends. The bidding process is being overseen by American bank, Raine Group, who were appointed by Roman Abramovich. Abramovich asked Raine to find buyers for Chelsea, before his assets were frozen by the UK Government in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Raine Group has given extra time to the interested parties, in order to “give them a full and fair opportunity to adequately finalise the details of their proposals”. The Raine Group are also waiting for clearance from the Premier League before presenting a preferred buyer to the UK government.
