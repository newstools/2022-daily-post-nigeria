The Federal Government says Nigeria has not broken relations with Russia for invading Ukraine. It added that Nigeria’s relationships with Russia and with Ukraine remain intact, the war between the two EU countries notwithstanding. Alhaji Zubairu Dada, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, stated this in Abuja on Thursday while fielding questions from newsmen at the weekly ministerial briefing organised by the Presidential Communications Team, NAN reports. Dada stressed that the ongoing war between the two neighbouring countries had not in any way affected Nigeria’s diplomatic ties with either of them. Corroborating the assertion, Nigeria’s Permanent Representative at the UN, Prof. Tijjani Bande, said Nigeria had never contemplated breaking diplomatic ties with Russia for invading Ukraine. “Nigeria has not broken relations with Russia and there are several connections between Nigeria and Russia on many issues. Education is one. Nigeria is not at war with Russia. “Russia remains a member of the UN Security Council and a member of the UN; it is a significant player in world politics. “Who knows, next week there may be no problem between Russia and Ukraine and how do you start your relationship with Russia all over? “It is a balancing act. It is not like we have reached a point where Russia is so evil that Nigeria should not even relate with it; should not eat food produced in Russia, or we cannot take gas because it is Russian-produced. “Balance is fundamental in diplomacy and Nigeria has been very clear in its view that the attack by Russia on Ukraine was unacceptable.”
