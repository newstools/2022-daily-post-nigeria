The Speaker, Adamawa State House of Assembly, Aminu Iya-Abbas, has declared the seat of Joseph Kwada, popularly known as ‘Depolis,’ member representing Michika Constituency vacant, for dumping the Peoples Democratic Party for the All Progressives Congress. Kwada had over the weekend in Michika dumped the PDP to APC giving injustice as the reason for his defection. He is the third legislator to defect to another political party under the 7th House of Assembly in the state. Ibrahim Italiya and Umar Musa Bororo, members representing Mayo Belwa and Mubi South had dumped the PDP for the APC, the opposition party in the state. Iya-Abbas, said Kwada’s seat was declared vacant following Pwamwakeno Mackondo’s presentation that the matter was a constitutional one, citing section 109 (1g) of the 1999 constitution to that effect.
