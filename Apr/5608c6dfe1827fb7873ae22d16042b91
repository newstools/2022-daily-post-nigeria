Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has revealed that Russian troops are accumulating forces, driving new battalion tactical groups and trying to start mobilisation in the south and east regions of Ukraine. Zelensky said that none of these steps by Russian troops would help Russia in the war against Ukraine. He made the comments in his latest video message to Ukrainians, according to BBC. “In the south and east of our country, the occupiers [Russian troops] continue to do everything to have a reason to talk about at least some victories,” Zelensky said. “They are accumulating forces, driving new battalion tactical groups to our land. They’re even trying to start the so-called mobilisation in the occupied regions of Ukraine. “None of these steps will help Russia in the war against our state. They can only delay the inevitable – the time when the invaders will have to leave our territory. In particular Mariupol – a city that continues to resist Russia, despite everything the occupiers say.” Meanwhile, Russian forces captured 42 villages in the eastern Donetsk region on Thursday.
