Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel has slammed his ‘sloppy’ side after Brentford thrashed them 4-1 on Saturday afternoon. It was Brentford’s first win over their West London rivals since 1939 as they move closer to relegation safety. The Blues took the lead through Antonio Rudiger three minutes into the second half, but Brentford responded with three goals in 10 minutes. Vitaly Janelt scored twice and Christian Eriksen netted his first goal for Brentford while Yoane Wissa added a fourth for Thomas Frank’s side. Tuchel told BBC Sport: “Nobody saw it coming, especially after going 1-0 ahead. It was very untypical of us. “But we stopped defending. We were not aware enough of the danger, were sloppy with the defending and got punished. “They made the most of it in those 10 minutes. “They were lucky and clinical enough to get three goals. We did not defend like it is needed to in the Premier League and got punished.” The German boss added: “We lost control for 10 minutes. It was a tough start for us which is also not the first time after an international break.” He said Chelsea players were comfortable after they scored the first goal thinking they have already won the match but got punished in 10 minutes. “In general we allowed too many shots and in general we lacked energy. We looked mentally tired which is normal after being around the world,” he added. “After scoring we forgot we still had 40 minutes to play. I think it was deserved that we took the lead. The German said his team made life difficult for themselves, adding that he did not expect them to win the match because they struggled in the game despite finding a way to be in the lead. He specifically blamed his defenders saying they stopped defending.
