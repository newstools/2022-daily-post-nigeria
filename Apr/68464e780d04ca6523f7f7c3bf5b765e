Ex-Manchester United midfielder, Paul Scholes has said that outgoing midfielder, Paul Pogba has ‘never learned as a footballer’. He, however, believes the outgoing Red Devils star could go on to become world-class. Reports emerged Tuesday morning that the France international has exited the Red Devils’ squad WhatsApp group. This happened a few days after his manager, Ralf Rangnick confirmed the 29-year-old has played his last game for the club. Asked about Pogba’s imminent Old Trafford exit, Scholes told talkSPORT: “I don’t know. I was there when he was a kid and this lad has got absolutely everything you would want in a footballer and a midfield player. “His physique, he can run. I just don’t think he’s ever learned as a footballer, he constantly seems to make the same mistakes over and over again. “It’s disappointing, it looks like he’s going to leave. He’ll go somewhere, a manager will get a grip of him, and I think he’ll do really well, as he did at Juventus. “For some reason, at Man United, it hasn’t worked out. It’s a big disappointment. You see what he does with France. “People see him the wrong way. He’s a nice lad, he wants to work and learn. I hope he goes on and does really well. We all know he’s got the ability and talent to be world class.”
