Former Arsenal and Barcelona star, Cesc Fabregas has sent a message to Chelsea’s potential new owner over manager, Thomas Tuchel. The Spaniard said that whoever succeeds in buying the club should feel ‘blessed’ to boast Tuchel as their manager. The former Chelsea star said this despite the Blues’ last night’s painful Champions League exit at the hands of Real Madrid. The German gaffer tore into Chelsea players after last week’s shock 3-1 defeat to Real Madrid at Stamford Bridge. And the Blues came within a whisker of completing a remarkable act of escapology at the Bernabeu on Tuesday night. Goals from Mason Mount, Antonio Rudiger and Timo Werner looked to have completed a remarkable comeback for the west Londoners. But Real Madrid managed to find their way back into the contest with Karim Benzema providing the decisive moment six minutes into extra time. And Fabregas, who won two Premier League titles during his spell with the Blues, was full of praise for Chelsea’s boss, tweeting: “Whatever happens. Chelsea are blessed with Thomas Tuchel. What a manager.”
