The Sector Commander, Mr Paul Okpe, said this in a statement issued by the command’s spokesperson, Mrs Agnes Ogungbemi, in Osogbo. Okpe said the accident happened at seven kilometres from Iwaraja junction at about 2.44 p.m., involving a Howo Sino Truck and a Nissan bus with number plate WEN 397 AA. “Three adult males and three female children were involved in the accident, killing two female children and injuring rest of the passengers. “The accident occurred due to speeding, tyre burst and total disobedience to road traffic regulations by the motorists involved,” the sector commander said. According to him, there was a tyre burst in one of the vehicles leading to loss of control before the accident happened. He said that the command would sanction any motorists found violating the traffic rules and regulations, NAN reports. Okpe said the corpses have been deposited at the morgue of the Wesley Guild Hospital, Ilesa, while the injured victims were taken to the same hospital for treatment
