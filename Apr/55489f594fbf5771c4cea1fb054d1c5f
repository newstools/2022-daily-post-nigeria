A former federal lawmaker that represented Zamfara Central Senatorial zone between 2021 and 2019, Senator Garba Kabiru Marafa has boasted that no power will allow Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle remain on seat beyond 2023. He said that there was no reason enough to allow Governor Matawalle continue to destroy the fortunes of Zamfara State. He did not, however, mention whether his group would dump the All Progressives Congress, APC, for another party. “We are are now set to revolt against the present government in the State through massive revolution because the people are tired of all these problems in the State,” he said. Zamfara APC has been faced with crisis following the conduct of the Party’s State congress.
