Veteran Nollywood star, Mercy Johnson Okojie has recalled her days of humble beginning and how she survived. The mother of four took to her Instagram page on Saturday, disclosing that despite the disadvantages faced in life, she always battled her storm in smiles. She wrote: “I tell them all the time, I am a Ghetto child. I know hunger, I know thirst, I know shame, yet I have always battled my storm in smiles. “22nd of May approaches and my heart does not stop skipping with lots of questions on my mind.” According to her, she was not perfect but chose to do better for her children and has seen a lot. “From nothing to here, all the suffering, I was not perfect at all but I chose to do better because of my kids. “So no matter what comes, I don see 99, so 100 is not anything,” she added.
