The Bishop of Methodist Church Nigeria, Diocese of Abakaliki, Rt. Rev. Lawson Elom on Friday warned politicians against the killing of innocent Nigerians, especially in the forthcoming 2023 general election. The Clergy warned Nigerians especially the leaders to stop looting the resources of the country and desist from killing to occupy political positions. Elom gave the charge while speaking with journalists, shortly after a Good Friday Service at the cathedral of the Holy Trinity, in Ebonyi State. He called on Christians, Nigerian leaders and the world at large to repent, change their attitudes and show much concern in making heaven at last. He said, “Christians should be getting themselves prepared because most of the things predicted by the scripture are gradually coming into fruition. People should change their attitudes, those in leadership in Nigeria should change their attitudes. “The way we behave doesn’t show that we have been hearing from the scripture. It doesn’t show that we are concerned about making heaven. Our interest is in making money. And when we acquire wealth, die and perish here, what gain have we made? “Not Christians alone, the world should change for the better. Look at the things the scripture talked about, sicknesses of all sorts, destructions here and there. These things are fulfilling one after the other, showing this is the end time. “The world should change for the better especially our country Nigeria. Our leaders should now repent from their sins. They should stop pursuing money the way they are doing it. “The 2023 general election is at the corner. A lot of them are going to kill people just to make sure that they occupy a position. What if, they occupy a position and trumpet sound tomorrow? And Jesus will ask you, why did you waste people’s blood in the 2023 election?” He stressed.
