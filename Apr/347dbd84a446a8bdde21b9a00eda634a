These are the Streets! And we answer the call. All of us lured by the sensational symphony of sound, aroma, taste, and color. We gather side by side for a chance to indulge in glorious, mind bending, soulful food. Together we share in the delights of the adogan, the mortar and pestle, and the koko irin. Seemingly ordinary pieces of iron and wood; yet seasoned by time and tradition, never failing to create the incredible. A quality we all share. The GTCO Food and Drink Festival. Witness the incredible”.
