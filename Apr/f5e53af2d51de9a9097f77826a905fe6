Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has told the club’s incoming manager Erik ten Hag to learn from Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta, and try to do what the Spaniard is currently doing at the Emirates. Ajax boss, Erik ten Hag will take over from interim boss Ralf Rangnick at Manchester United at the end of the season. The Dutchman has signed a three-year deal and has been given the mandate to rebuild the club and return them to their former glory. And Scholes, a former Manchester United midfielder, has given his verdict on the appointment, urging the Dutchman to follow Mikel Arteta’s blueprint at Arsenal. “It’s a big job for him, it’s a big job for anybody,” Scholes told talkSPORT. “There’s an element of risk about it, but there’s a risk with any manager you appoint. “I think he’s done really well at Ajax. He’s got a really good pedigree, working with Pep at Bayern as well. “He has to believe in his method. This job is ten times the job of Ajax. “We know they’re the best team in Holland. But Man United is a worldwide football club. “He’ll have to accept criticism, but I think he’s got a talented group of players. “He just has to get them to believe in his methods. It’s quite obvious they haven’t believed in what they’re being coached with the last two managers and haven’t believed in the way they’re playing. “If you look at what Arteta has done at Arsenal, that was a big rebuilding job and he’s taken no nonsense. I think this manager has to do exactly the same.”
