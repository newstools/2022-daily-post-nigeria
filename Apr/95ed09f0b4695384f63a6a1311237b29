The ruling APC in Cross River State has advised aspirants for different political offices to decamp if they are not satisfied with consensus arrangements in the party. Chairman of the party, Alphonsus Eba spoke over a radio programme. Many aspirants in the state who were told to accept the consensus arrangements have expressed displeasure. Eba said it is not compulsory for disenchanted ones to remain stuck in APC when they can decamp or form their own parties. “If any one of you feels dissatisfied with the decision of the party to go for consensus candidates you can decamp to other parties who are looking for candidates and pursue your ambitions. “Better still, you may proceed to form your own party where it can be possible to impose your candidature. “In APC, the decision of the party is supreme.” Speaking to journalists, a party stalwart, John George Alaha who spoke on behalf of one of the aspirants, said, “consensus is never part of democracy. We have spent money to buy forms, do declarations and consultations, and we are asked to step down. This is not going down well.” Another chieftain, a US-based Archbishop, Ikpeme Johnson called on political parties in Nigeria to tread the issue of consensus candidates cautiously. “Let there be a level playing ground for all contestants both in Cross River State and the country. “The aspirants should be allowed to test their popularity amongst the people.”
