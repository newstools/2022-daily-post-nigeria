The picture of a baby, born by one of the abducted pregnant women in the camp of terrorists that attacked the Abuja – Kaduna bound train has been released by the hoodlums. DAILY POST gathered that the baby’s mother was barely 8 months pregnant when she was kidnapped along with several others in the ill-fated train attack on 28 March, 2022. The picture of the new born baby girl, clad in a thick pink dress and a light lemon sweater cap was allegedly revealed on Wednesday evening by the terrorists group suspected to be Ansaru, a breakaway group from Boko Haram. Recall that two days ago, the social media, as well as the conventional media, were awash with the news that one of the pregnant women abducted by the terrorists had delivered a baby girl.
