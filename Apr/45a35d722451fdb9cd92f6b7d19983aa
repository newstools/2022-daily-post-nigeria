Liverpool legend, Jamie Carragher, has told new Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag to sell two or three players when he takes over at Stamford Bridge in the summer. According to him, two or three troublemakers must leave the club if the Dutchman is looking forward to making a success of his reign at Old Trafford. The Red Devils confirmed earlier today that the 52-year-old Dutchman is now the next permanent manager and will take over from interim boss Ralf Rangnick at the end of the season. He has already signed a three-year deal at the club which can be extended by a year if agreed by both parties. Asked what the Dutchman’s priority should be once he arrives at Manchester United, the Liverpool legend told Sky Sports: “Getting good players and getting some out. “If he can get two or three signings right, move two or three players on who are maybe causing problems or don’t suit his way of playing. “He’ll revitalise some players and he’ll probably have to add three or four players to the starting XI.”
