With the 2023 general elections gathering momentum, traditional rulers in Ondo State have urged politicians to see public office as a place to serve the people rather than making it a do-or-die affair. The monarchs under the aegis of 130 Crowned Obas tasked politicians to always have the fear of God by playing the game by its rules. While admonishing the political class to evolve a rancour-free electioneering process, they maintained that a premium should be placed on issues-based campaigns devoid of mud-slinging and calumny. They also advocated a conducive environment for journalism practice in the country, with advice to media practitioners to ply their trade in line with the law of the land and to be patriotic in carrying out their constitutional role. In a statement signed by the Olumoru Of Imoru, Oba Rotimi Obamuwagun, on behalf of the traditional rulers, Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, was lauded for his courage in ensuring peace across the State despite “coordinated and unrelenting attacks by bandits.” They pointed out that, despite security being the sole responsibility of the federal government, the Ondo State government has taken on the burden of protecting the people and their property at a very high expense.
