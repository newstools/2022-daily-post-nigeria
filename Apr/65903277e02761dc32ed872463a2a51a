Acting National Chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Olu Agunloye has resigned from the position. The former Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain said he has assumed the position of Acting National Secretary. Agunloye made the disclosure to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Akure on Wednesday. The politician explained that his resignation was not due to his suspension by the party in the State. The development, he said, was to strengthen the platform’s chances ahead of the 2023 general elections. Agunloye was suspended from his ward (ward 10) in Akoko North-West Local Government Area, following a resolution of the executives. He said the SDP National Executive Committee (NEC) met on March 22 and announced that all positions zoned to the South are now zoned to the North. “There is no big deal about swapping in the party because the presidential aspirant is coming from the South. One of them is coming from Ondo State. “It is not politically expedient to allow the presidential candidate to come from the South and the national chairman also from Ondo. “And for me, to do so without commotion is to resign my position as a national chairman of the party,” he said. The former minister stated that his suspension has no effect because those who took the decision have no such powers. “They are frustrated people and we will not provoke them the more. But if they take it away from political rascality to crime, we would curtail them”, Agunloye warned.
