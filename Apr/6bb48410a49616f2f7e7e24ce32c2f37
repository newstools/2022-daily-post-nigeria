Some yet to be identified gunmen on Tuesday night ambushed the convoy of the member representing Jos North/Bassa Constituency in the House of Representatives of Plateau State, Hon. Musa Agah. DAILY POST gathered that the lawmaker, who was elected on the 26th February 2022 in a by-election in the constituency, and his aides were said to be returning home from a thank-you tour around 9 pm when the attackers struck along Twin Hill Miango, in Bassa LGA of the state. Agah was said to be in the company of his wife, two kids, personal assistant and driver. Narrating the incident, the National Secretary-General, Irigwe Development Association, Danjuma Dickson Auta, said, “We thank God, the lawmaker and all others escaped, but his car was battered and shattered by gunshot bullets. “While on a sad note, two others on a motorcycle who were ahead of them first encountered the ambush were killed.” However, when contacted, the Spokesman of the State Police Command, ASP Ubah Ogaba, said, “We are aware of the incident in Miango, last night. “The CP has sent in a tactical team to investigate the incident. “Initially we got information that two men were ambushed and killed, then we later got informed about the attack on the lawmaker; so as I said investigation is still ongoing.” “But everywhere in the affected area is calm, and peaceful”, he maintained. Bassa LGA and in particular the Irigwe chiefdom has been the hotbed of attacks by suspected Fulani herdsmen in the past five years; the recent being the killing of two persons, and another over two weeks ago, when 10 people were killed and 19 others injured during “Zereci,” a festival that ushers in the farming season. Also, in 2012, Sen. Gyang Dantong and Hon. Gyang Fulani, were both killed when gunmen attacked mourners who went to bury some victims of attacks in Barkin Ladi LGA of the state.
