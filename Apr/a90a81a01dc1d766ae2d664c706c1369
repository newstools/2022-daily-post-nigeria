The Executive Director of the Nigerian Institute for Oil Palm Research (NIFOR), Dr. Celestin Ikuenobe, has submitted the outstanding payment vouchers of N100 million to the Senate Public Accounts Committee. The Senate panel through the report of the Auditor-General for the Federation had queried the Institute for spending N210 million without payment vouchers. It was gathered that the alleged infractions by the Auditor General of the Federation against the Institute were committed during the previous administration. But, the NIFOR boss was able to present N110 million vouchers to the Committee and it was resolved that the Executive Director of the Institute should provide the outstanding vouchers of N100 million to the panel two weeks ago However, at the resumption of the Committee meeting, the Director of the Institute presented the outstanding voucher of N100 million, putting to rest the allegations of spending the N210 million without payment vouchers. He presented relevant vouchers for clearance before the panel, ahead of the Easter break. The query had said: “Four hundred and twenty-three (423) payments totalling ₦210,921,849.66 (Two hundred and ten million, nine hundred and twenty-one thousand, eight hundred and forty-nine naira, sixty-six kobo) were made without payment vouchers and internal audit checks, contrary to Financial Regulations 601 and 1705 which stipulate that all payments must be vouched for, and the head of the internal audit unit in all Ministries/Extra-ministerial offices and other arms of government shall ensure that100% pre-payment audit of all checked and passed vouchers is carried out and the vouchers forwarded under security schedule directly to the appropriate central pay office for payment. “The Executive Director’s response vide Ref.
