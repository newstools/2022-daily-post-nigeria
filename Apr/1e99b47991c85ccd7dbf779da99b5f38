Gunmen on Thursday evening invaded a cattle market in Igboukwu in Aguata Local Government Area, Anambra State, killing cows and goats. DAILY POST gathered that the gunmen headed to Igboukwu after they left Ekwulobia, the headquarters of Soludo’s local government council, where they burnt down structures and vehicles. Mr Iyke Orji, who was in the area, confirmed the incident. In a Facebook post, Orji said: “The unknown firemen/gunmen after burning Aguata local government Secretariat, plied through Ekwulobia and headed straight to Igboukwu. “Stopping at Igboukwu gallop, there’s a cattle ranch where they sell over 30 cows by your right hand, those cows belong to an Igbo man. “These guys entered there, and killed all the cows belonging to an Igbo man.” A video trending on social media also showed slain cows littering the cattle market, with traders bemoaning their loss.
