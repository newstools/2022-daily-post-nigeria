Former Manchester United defender, Rio Ferdinand has said Chelsea defender, Antonio Rudiger will regret his reactions at full time, after they were dumped out of the Champions League by Real Madrid. Rudiger pushed Madrid centre-back David Alaba away when he tried to console him after the match. Chelsea were eliminated from the competition despite winning 3-2 on the night, as they had lost 3-1 at Stamford Bridge. As the final whistle went, Alaba went to put his arms around Rudiger and console him, but the Germany international pushed him away and stormed off screaming, before dropping to his knees. Other Real Madrid players tried to speak with Rudiger, but he remained furious on the ground. Ferdinand, speaking on BT Sport, said: “It’s emotional, man. And I don’t think he’d necessarily want to react like that or see those pictures. “But the feeling there you can’t control it. We’ve all been there after big games, I’ve said and done things that you regret, you think: ‘that’s not me, that’s not my normal personality’. But this is what football means to people.”
