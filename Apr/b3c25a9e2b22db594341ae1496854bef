The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) New Generation has condemned the “intimidation” of Nigerians by the All Progressives Congress, APC-led government. Addressing the media on Wednesday, the Director, Audu Mahmood insisted that freedom of expression and right to protest are guaranteed in the constitution. “The people granted their rights to criticize and lead protests against the PDP government are now the ones intimidating and oppressing individuals speaking against the incompetency of the APC-led government”, he lamented. Mahmood recalled how a minister blamed government’s lack of proactiveness and provision of needed technology for the Abuja-Kaduna rail attack. He said the mayhems in schools, roads, railways, and airports “revealed carelessness of the leadership at the federal level”. Mahmood stated that “the lazy Nigerian youths mentioned by President Muhammadu Buhari are all in APC”. The official charged the young demography across the country “to talk the talk, and walk the walk”. “We were born during the regime of General Muhammdu Buhari as Head of State, and we are still in another regime of President Muhammadu Buhari. “We can no longer sit on fence by merely agitating on social media, while the older generation to take all slots and continue to misrule us. “It is time to take our rightful place at the table, where the issues of our future are discussed and negotiated,” he said. Mahmood told the youths to be courageous and either run for offices in any party of their choice or participate actively in the electoral process. The PDP body advised the national leadership to ensure that aspirants “are not imposed on godfatherism basis”. Mahmood also demanded that primaries should be conducted in a way that will produce “the best flag-bearers at all levels”.
