Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, has reacted to their 3-1 defeat at Arsenal on Saturday. The Red Devils came into the game at the Emirates, looking to bounce back from a 4-0 hammering against Liverpool. However, they were two goals down in the first half, thanks to goals from Nuno Tavares and Bukayo Saka, before Cristiano Ronaldo pulled one back. Granit Xhaka’s long range effort settled the thrilling affair between the top-four hopefuls. Speaking after the game, Rangnick said: “The only weak side of our performance today was we didn’t defend well on the sides of the box. “We showed an improved performance but a disappointing result. We had numerous chances to score more goals. “We hit the post twice plus the crossbar. Very unlucky for us.”
