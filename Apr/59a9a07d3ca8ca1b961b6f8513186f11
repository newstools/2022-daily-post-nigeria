Three power towers have collapsed in Ogun State, plunging Abeokuta and other Ogun communities into darkness. The Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC) said three towers on the Papalanto/Ojere 132KV double-circuit lines collapsed, leaving the State capital, Ayetoro, Imeko, Owode Egba and Mowe with no power supply for days. In a statement signed by its Management on Wednesday, the IBEDC said the collapse of the towers adversely affected Abeokuta Transmission Sub-station (T/S), Ojere and New Abeokuta T/S at Kobape. According to the statement shared on its social media handle, it was stated that all the 33KV feeders from the affected sub-stations will be out until the towers are reconstructed.

The distribution company apologized to its consumers for the inconvenience, assuring them that power would be restored as soon as the towers are fixed. “Dear esteemed customer, Kindly be informed of the collapse of three towers on the Papalanto/Ojere 132KV double-circuit lines.
