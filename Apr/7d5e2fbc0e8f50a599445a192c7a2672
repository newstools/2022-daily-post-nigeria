Bauchi State Governor Bala Mohammed has told a former Jigawa State Governor, Sule Lamido, that it was a pity he was not consulted before he was selected as one of the Peoples Democratic Party’s consensus candidates by northern elders. Lamido had slammed the PDP Northern elders for picking Mohammed and former Senate President, Bukola Saraki as party consensus Presidential Candidates. As DAILY POST reported earlier, northern elders met at the home of former military ruler, Ibrahim Babangida and decided on Mohammed and Saraki as consensus candidates after deliberations. This decision did not go down well with Lamido, who, kicking against it, said the northern elders who made the selection do not speak for PDP members in the North. However, Mohammed in reaction to Lamido’s comments said he was entitled to his opinion, adding that the fact the former Governor was not consulted does not mean other members of the party were not reached out to before the endorsement. Addressing reporters in Bauchi on Saturday, the Governor said, “People may take it as something that is influenced. “I have tremendous respect for Alhaji Sule Lamido as a former Governor and who is leading former Governors. He is entitled to his opinion. “It’s a pity if he was not consulted or if he was not contacted but certainly, he is not the only person in Northern Nigeria.
