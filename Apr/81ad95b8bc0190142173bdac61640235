The Kogi State Police Command has debunked the kidnap of 15 passengers along the Anyigba-Itobe highway of the state. The Kogi Police Public Relations Officer, (PPRO), SP William Ocvye Aya, while reacting to an online media report (not DAILY POST) concerning the incident on Thursday described the report as false, malicious and highly mischievous. Aya noted that the command had on Wednesday 6th April 2022 received a distress call about a kidnap incident in Ojuwo-Ajebgo village of Ofu Local Government Area and immediately, the police swung into action to rescue the affected victims. Narrating the incident, the PPRO said, “on Wednesday 6th April 2022, the Command received a report that one Toyota bus with Registration Number Benue 192 XA driven by one Benard Ejeh conveying 16 passengers from Abuja heading to Benue State via Ankpa ran into kidnappers at Ojuwo-Ajebgo village of Ofu Local Government Area along Anyigba road. “Immediately the operatives of Quick Response Unit stationed at Itobe promptly swung into action pursued the hoodlums into the bush and rescued 12 passengers including the driver while four other passengers are yet to be seen. “The Commissioner of Police, CP Edward Egbuka who was on a visiting tour at Kogi East Senatorial Zone got the information while he was on his way to Ejule, immediately moved to the scene met with the rescued passengers and ordered that they should be moved to Itobe Division for debriefing. “The Commissioner of Police immediately deployed a tactical team to the area to continue trailing the hoodlums with a view to rescuing other victims.” He however urged members of the public, especially social media handlers, to always verify facts of incidents from the police before publishing or misinforming the general public.
