The Global Climate and Health Alliance has issued its position on the Mitigation of Climate Change report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The communique proposes drastic action to provide humanity with a chance to limit overall global warming to within Paris Agreement targets. In a statement on Tuesday, the global coalition of health professionals and health civil society organizations said the report could not be more explicit. Executive Director Jeni Miller urged leaders worldwide to rapidly phase out fossil fuels and transition to clean, renewable energy. Miller demanded that all sectors, governments and businesses immediately reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The official said the war in Ukraine and its repercussions further highlight the urgent need to navigate away from activities that put people’s health and lives at risk. “During his April 4th speech, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterrez made clear that countries that are increasing fossil fuel production are ‘dangerous radicals’. “If we continue to tolerate this radical behaviour that flies in the face of robust, consensus scientific evidence, we would condemn our children, and the generations that follow, to a planet that is close to uninhabitable.” Miller noted that by putting health and equity at the centre of climate policy making, governments can deliver policies that garner widespread support and maximise returns on investment. The director said policies that reduce emissions can also deliver cleaner air and water, healthier diets, more livable cities, and transportation systems designed to benefit the people’s health. The coalition charged citizens hold their governments to account by demanding climate action and advised leaders to summon the courage “to step away from business as usual”.
