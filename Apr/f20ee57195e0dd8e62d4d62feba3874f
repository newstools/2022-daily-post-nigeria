Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard has named Mohamed Salah, Bruno Fernandes, Kevin De Bruyne and Virgil van Dijk as the best legs in the Premier League he wishes he could have played alongside. Gerrard retired from playing football in 2016 after a glittering 19-year playing career. The former Liverpool captain made 710 appearances for the Reds winning nine trophies including the Champions League. In a Q&A with United legend Gary Neville for The Overlap, the former England captain was asked to name one current player in the Premier League he would have loved to have played with. He said, “Mo Salah. I love Bruno Fernandes – you might agree with that. I really like him. “Kevin De Bruyne for sure, 100 per cent, I think he’s one of the best in the world right now. Defensive-wise, I think Virgil [van Dijk] is out of this world.”
