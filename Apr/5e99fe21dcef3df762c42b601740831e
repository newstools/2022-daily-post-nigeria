From the Osun 2022 gubernatorial election timetable set by the electoral umpire, political parties were to kick off their campaign by Sunday, April 17, 2022. The INEC time table also directed that July 14 will be the last day for the governorship campaign. It was also learnt that fifteen candidates from approved political parties will be jostling for the number one political office in the State. From the outcome of the gubernatorial primaries of the contending political parties, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, who is the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) will be seeking re-election into office for a second term of four years. Also, the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Ademola Adeleke, who was the close contender in the 2018 gubernatorial election, will again fly the flag of the opposition party. A former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Lasun Yusuff will be flying the flag of the Labour Party (LP), while Akin Ogunbiyi is the Accord Party candidate, among others. In the APC, the faction loyal to Rauf Aregbesola, a former Osun governor and Minister of Interior, which opposed the emergence of Adegboyega Oyetola has filed a case in the court seeking the party to present Moshood Adeoti, their own candidate as the gubernatorial candidate. Also, Dotun Babayemi of the PDP is embroiled in a legal tussle challenging the candidature of Ademola Adeleke as the PDP gubernatorial candidate.
