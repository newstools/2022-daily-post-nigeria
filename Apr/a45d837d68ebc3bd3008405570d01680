An All Progressives Congress Chieftain, Olorogun Jaro Egbo, also known as High Voltage and his supporters have dumped the party and rejoined the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP in Delta State. The party man said he decamped from the party because it failed to fulfil its promises to Nigerians after it took over from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. At a mega rally held in Ughelli Township Stadium, Olorogun Egbo said the PDP is the “promised land”. The people in the APC are deceitful and they made promises without fulfilling them. He thanked the leaders of the PDP for accepting him and others back into their fold “I have come with a good message. PDP remains the hope for all Nigerians. I am back to the PDP and I want to assure the governor of the State and the PDP that victory for the party come 2023 will begin from Ughelli North.” In a remark, the Delta State Governor, Arthur Ifeanyi Okowa stated that the PDP is on a mission to rescue the Country from the hardship being meted on Nigerians by the APC led federal government. “Nigerians have suffered enough and they’re tired. So, we must give them hope that there will be light at the end of the tunnel. The PDP Chairman in Delta State, Kingsley Esiso in a remark welcomed the decampeea back to the party.
