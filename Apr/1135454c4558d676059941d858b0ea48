Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand has sympathized with Liverpool’s Joel Matip, insisting that the defender should be fuming at being dropped for the Reds’ Champions League semi-final first-leg 2-0 win over Villarreal on Wednesday night. Recall that Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp opted to drop Matip for Ibrahima Konate, who paired Virgil van Dijk in defence, as an own goal from Pervis Estupinan and a strike from Sadio Mane gave the Reds the win over Villarreal. Matip has started 27 matches in the Premier League this season, but Konate and Van Dijk have shared duties in Champions League. “If I’m Joel Matip, I am fuming,” Ferdinand said on BT Sport before Liverpool vs Villarreal kick-off. “He has been exceptional all season and we talk about being the best defenders on form in the league, he would be in there for a shout after Van Dijk. “So yeah set-pieces must be a big thing for his team selection this evening. “I think the most impressive thing for me is the way [Jurgen Klopp] has been able to utilise his squad. “Just shuffling the back at any given time, and those players are coming in and impacting the team. “They’re playing big roles in that, Konate is a good example for that, he has come in and scored goal after goal, and as a manager it’s a dream scenario at the business end of the season.” He added: “It is a Champions League semi-final so of course you are going to play your best team, but I think Matip all season has been number one all season, but I think the goals that Konate has scored in the past few games, he does add something different.”
