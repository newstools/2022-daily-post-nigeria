Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM), says 13 of the 19 Nigerians held in different camps in Poland have been released. The Nigerians, according to the Commission, were released due to the intervention of Nigeria’s Ambassador to Poland, Christian Ugwu. NiDCOM announced this in a statement signed by the Head of Media, Public Relations, and Protocols Unit, NiDcOM, Abuja Abdur-Rahman Balogun, on Wednesday. The Federal Government had swiftly ordered the evacuation of Nigerians, largely students, stranded in the Russian-Ukraine crisis back home in March. Some Nigerians, on the other hand, opted to stay behind and were detained in Polish detention centres. According to Ugwu, one of the six people still in detention camps claimed to be Cameroonian because their mother is from the country. “Unfortunately, the remaining five, including Igwe Ikechukwu Christian, who had been interviewed by certain foreign media, all applied for international protection (asylum) in Poland. “They would not be released until the Polish government makes a decision on their application or until they decide to withdraw it,” the Envoy said. Despite the fact that Nigerians had been thoroughly warned about the anticipated repercussions of continuing as unauthorized immigrants in Poland, he assured Nigerians that the mission would continue to do everything possible to protect their interests.
