Another Nigerian Air Force (NAF) plane has crashed. Two pilots may have lost their lives. An impeccable source told DAILY POST on Tuesday night that the incident occurred “some hours ago”. “An Air Force plane has crashed, two pilots feared dead. The plane was flying from Kaduna to Abuja”, the informant said. It is not yet known if bandits/terrorists struck again or if the cause was a mechanical failure. NAF Director of Public Relations, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet did not take phone calls for a reaction. The spokesman’s number was off when called again before press time. On July 18 2021, DAILY POST first reported that a NAF fighter plane went down while on a mission in the North-West. After initial denial, the military confirmed the mishap in a statement the next day. NAF explained that Alpha aircraft was returning an air interdiction between the boundaries of Zamfara and Kaduna States. Bandits opened fire which led to its crash in Zamfara. The pilot, Flight Lieutenant Abayomi Dairo survived.
