A notorious bandits’ leader, known as Nasanda, has demanded the sum of N30 million from Zamfara State government for neutralizing his wife, her uncle and her aunt or he would kill 300 persons to revenge the killings. According to reports, the bandits’ leader had already given a 14-day ultimatum to the State government to pay the 30 million naira as compensation for the three deceased persons or face massive killings in the State. “If the State government fails to pay the compensation, I vow that I would lead to the killing of 300 community people,” he said. In a recorded audio message trending on social media, Nasanda described the murder of his bride, her uncle, and aunt as deliberate, saying that the Yansakai men knew that they were related to him. In the audio, the Nasanda was quoted as saying that he has been realistic and not greedy in asking for the N30 million compensation, adding that if he was greedy, he would have demanded for N50 million for each of the people killed. “I cannot give months for the government to settle me, the 14 days would be enough to settle my demands. And we will not attack until when people are on their farms. If our Fulani people are not allowed to live in peace, we will also not allow others to live in peace. “If the government can’t pay the N30 million demanded, the government should be ready to see me in action. I will kill 300 people to avenge the death of my bride and two of her relations. Yes, the lives of 900 will be in danger,” he warned. DAILY POST reports that as of the time of filing this report, there has been no official statement from Zamfara State Police Command and all efforts to get the State Commissioner of Security and Internal Affairs, DIG (rtd), Mr. Mamman Tsafe for confirmation over the threat proved abortive, as his line was not going.
