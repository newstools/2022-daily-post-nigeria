Ex-Sampdoria and Cagliari manager, Walter Zenga, is keen to become the head coach of the Nigeria national team, Tutto Napoli reports. The role is vacant since Augustine Eguavoen stepped down after the Super Eagles failed to qualify for the 2022 World Cup. The Nigerian Football Federation, NFF, are currently scouting for a new handler. Those who have shown interest include former Sporting Lisbon coach Jose Peseiro, ex-Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde, former PSG and France coach Laurent Blanc and former PSV Eindhoven manager Phillip Cocu. Zenga has now joined the race after the NFF contacted him for the job. It is believed he is keen to return to work after his last experience at Cagliari in 2020. Zenga won the Serie A title in 1989 and the UEFA Cup in 1991 and 1994 with the Nerazzurri. He has successfully managed clubs in the United States, Italy, Turkey, Romania, Serbia, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and England.
