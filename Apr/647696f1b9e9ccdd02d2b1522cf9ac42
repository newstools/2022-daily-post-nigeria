Liverpool and Manchester United fans united on Tuesday in support of Cristiano Ronaldo. The two clubs’ fans came together during tonight’s crunch league clash following news of the Portugal international’s baby son’s death. Ronaldo had on Monday night announced that he and his partner Georgina Rodriguez’s baby son had died. The baby died during childbirth and for this reason, he was excused from the Manchester United game against Liverpool. However, both club’s fans paid their respects to the football icon and his family and rose to their feet to clap during the seventh minute of the match. Liverpool are already leading United with a 3rd-minute effort from Luis Diaz and fans still took time to clap for Ronaldo. Liverpool fans also sang their popular ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’ song for the Portugal international and his family. Also, both sets of players wore black armbands in respect of the 37-year-old former Real Madrid and Juventus star.
