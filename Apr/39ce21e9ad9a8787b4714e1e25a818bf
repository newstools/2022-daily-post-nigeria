Ghanaian actor, Majid Michel has said there’s nothing wrong with using weed describing it as a God-made plant. Majid said this while speaking with Kent Mensah on Asaase radio in Ghana. The actor and preacher asked the Ghanaian government to legalise and commercialize the use of weed in the country. Majid said: “I have done drugs before and indulged in drugs before. “I have done hard drugs not weed but I don’t see anything wrong with weed, it was God-made. It was created by God. “Maybe because of the smoke maybe that’s why it’s not advisable health-wise. “It’s advisable for people to brew and drink it because that’s not wrong at all.” He, however, advised the Ghanaian government to take precautionary steps before legalizing weed. Majid also advised those below the age of 25 not to indulge in the use of weed. “I’m for it completely but then again before anything is legalized, the government must ensure that they are ready to take responsibility and must exhaust the consequences that come with the legalization of ‘weed’ before the decision is made. “Before the government decides to pass a law for the legalisation of weed then they must make sure that they’ve exhausted all possible avenues by learning from countries who have done it. “If the government is not ready to take responsibility for the consequences [for legalising ‘weed’] then it should not make that decision,” Majid advised.
