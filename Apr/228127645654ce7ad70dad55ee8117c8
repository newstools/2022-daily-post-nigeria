Suspected bandits reportedly attacked several communities in Kagarko Local Government Area of Kaduna State and killed several residents, including an All Progressives Congress, APC, ward chairman. A source, who resides in the community, Alhaji Umar Sani, told DAILY POST on Tuesday, that the gunmen invaded the communities in what he described as coordinated attacks on Monday night, shooting sporadically. He said the sound of the gunshots made several villagers scamper for safety, adding that the ward chairman of the APC, Mr. Illiya Auta, was hit by a stray bullet and died immediately. According to him, scores of the residents were abducted while some cows were rustled during the attack, which occurred on Monday night “It was during the attack that the Aribi ward chairman of the APC, Mr. Illiya Auta, was gunned down. “Several other residents were killed during the attack that occurred Monday night. “The bandits also whisked scores of the villagers to an unknown destination while others were seriously wounded,” he said. He added bandits also rustled several cows and household animals, just as he appealed to the government to come to their aid as bandits have taken over their villages. The Kaduna Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige did not pick his calls when contacted by DAILY POST.
