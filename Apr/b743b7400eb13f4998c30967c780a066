Nollywood actress, Mary Njoku has told married men who are not satisfied with having one wife to have an open marriage. According to her, this will restore peace of mind as the women will also respectfully help themselves too. On her Instagram page, she wrote; “Dear married men, if your wife cannot satisfy your ‘inner room’ needs kindly ‘Open’ your marriages and with her blessing, you can have peace of mind to discreetly share your ‘talent’ with the world. “While she quietly and respectfully helps herself too, with your blessing of course. Being with one man for the rest of her life is BORING too but she loves you too much to complain.” Njoku, however, concluded that a happy couple and one that works together results to mentally healthy children. “At all times, the couple have to WORK together It’s amazing what you can achieve when you are in WORK TOGETHER’ Happy Husband, Happy Wife, mentally healthy kids,” Njoku read. Njoku spoke on the backdrop of the news of popular Nollywood actor, Yul Edochie’s second wife saga. Despite criticisms, Edochie took to his Instagram page declaring his first wife still remains his number one.
