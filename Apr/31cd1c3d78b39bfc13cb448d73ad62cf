Arsenal midfielder, Granit Xhaka has recalled he planned to dump the north London side over the lack of support from the Gunners fans. The midfielder had in 2019, said his ‘bags were packed and he was done with Arsenal’. In 2022, Xhaka who is still at the London side claims he is now ‘finished’ with the Gunners and that he can still see the faces of angry fans even when he closes his eyes’. Xhaka spoke about his career at Arsenal in a candid interview with the Players’ Tribune. “I had barely begun to move when I heard the boos,” he said. “And it was not just a few guys in the corner – it was a lot of people. I was shocked. I had never experienced anything like this. “This is hate. Pure hate. I am really not exaggerating this. “To feel that level of hatred and disrespect – I wouldn’t want it for my worst enemy,” he said. “Still to this day, if we have lost, I hate walking those last metres to the tunnel, because I still recognise the faces. The same people are sitting there. “So now, I just keep my head down. I lived through that nightmare once. I don’t ever want to do it again.”
