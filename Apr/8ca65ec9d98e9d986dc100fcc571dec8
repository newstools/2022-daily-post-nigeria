The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has said that the minor fire outbreak, which occurred at its Makurdi branch early Thursday morning, had been put out and no damage was done. Director, Corporate Communications, Mr Osita Nwanisobi, said this in a statement posted on the apex bank’s website on Thursday. The statement said, “A minor fire occurred at our Makurdi Branch at about 7.00 a.m. Thursday, April 21, 2022, and was swiftly checked moments after it was detected. “The prompt response of the Bank’s security and facility management units as well as support from the Benue State Fire Service helped to extinguish the fire and prevented any damage from being done at the main office building. “Reports indicate that the fire started from the fuel dump behind the branch building, sending smoke into the atmosphere. Fortunately, there were no fatalities and the affected site has since been cordoned off for further investigation. “Normal work has also continued at the branch,’’ it said.
