Nollywood actress Tonto Dikeh has reacted to the messy fight between Nkechi Blessing and her ex-husband, Opeyemi Falegan. Blessing had on Instagram live dragged her husband after he confirmed their split and called her a lesbian. She accused Falegan of not having a functioning manhood and low performance in bed. She has since continued to defend herself while slamming her ex-husband. Reacting to Nkechi’s outburst, Tonto, making a comment on the Instagram post, stated that she thought she was the crazy one but Nkechi has proven to be crazier than she ever was. “I think say ‘I’m crazy, take your flower,” Tonto wrote. Recall Tonto Dikeh currently began dragging and mocking her ex-lover, Prince Kpokpogri. Remember the couple fell out in 2021 after Tonto Dikeh accused Kpokpogri of cheating on her, claiming he has in possession sex tapes of his lovers and exes.
