A group, Concerned MACBAN Youths, has lamented tenure elongation by the national executives of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN). Umar A. Bonga, National Coordinator of the group, in a statement expressed dismay at the attempts to elongate the tenure of officials of MACBAN. The statement explained, “In the interest of justice, fairness and duly regards to legitimate authorities, the above association of Concern Members has risen in complete disagreement with the continuous remaining in power of the elected officials whose mandate and authority were expired on 10th day of April 2022. As a result of the provision of the MACBAN’s constitution stipulates four years per term.” The statement observed that incidentally, the national officials have served for two terms of eight years consecutively, saying that the tenure elapsed on 10th April 2022 with no plan to elect new officials. It noted that unfortunately and against travesty of justice, they have refused to relinquish their seat even though they no longer have powers of electorates and mandate which made it possible for them to be there in the first place. It regretted the unconstitutional posture and abuse of constitutional provision of MACBAN by the expired officials, alleging that the national executives have established alliances with states executives to flout their constitution. The group noted that as such, their decision is unanimous and appealed to the Sultanate to ensure that due process is followed which includes handing overall office activities, official engagements, official documents and financial statements to the Board of Trustees (BOTs) that would subsequently appoint a Caretaker Committee that will act as a transition body pending when proper fair and free election is conducted. The group stressed that only setting up a caretaker committee would bring back the sincerity, patriotism and the much talk about protection of the MACBAN members all over the country.
