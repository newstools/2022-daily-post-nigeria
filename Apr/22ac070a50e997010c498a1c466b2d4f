As power outages continue to bite harder across Nigeria, the National Chairman of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Mr. Ralphs Nwosu, on Sunday, condemned President Muhammadu Buhari’s ineptitude and lack of political will to ensure a constant power supply in the country. Nwosu, in a statement in Abuja, said this in reaction to the over 48 hours of electricity blackout nationwide due to grid collapse. He said the power outage has badly affected the poor masses and small scale enterprises coupled with the high-cost of fuel and diesel. He carpeted the ruling All Progressives Congress, saying that the party has failed woefully by snubbing their own electioneering campaigns, urging Nigerians to chase APC out of power in the 2023 general election. The party called on President Buhari to sack the Minister of Power for his inability to effectively tackle power challenges. “Sack power minister over his inability to take responsibility and efficiently pilot the sector to achieve power infrastructure renewal and private sector investment in grid and off-grid renewable energy sources. “Barely 24 hours after the National power systems crashed at about 10:40 am on Monday, the grid collapsed at 5.10 pm on Tuesday evening and again at 6:30 pm on Friday”, he said. He further faulted the APC-controlled government that power remained at 2,000 megawatts for the past months.
