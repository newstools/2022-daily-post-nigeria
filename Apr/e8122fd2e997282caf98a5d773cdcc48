Armed men suspected to be bandits terrorising Kaduna State and other parts of the Northeast have attacked communities in Kagarko Local Government of the state. Governorship aspirant, Shehu Sani confirmed this in a post on his verified Twitter handle on Monday. The former lawmaker said the incident which led to the abduction of an unspecified number of Almajirai, one Yusuf, Alh Kasuwa and others, occurred on Sunday night. He said, “Yesternight, bandits raided Jere, Kagarko LG in Kaduna State near Abuja and kidnapped some people; Yusuf and his family. Kasuwa and his family. Dantala Direba and his family. Sule Maishago and his family and an unspecified number of Almajiri. We pray for their release”. Efforts by DAILY POST to reach the Kaduna State Police Public Relations Officer, Mohammed Jalige for comment on the purported incident, proved abortive as of press time. Bloodthirsty bandits have been on a rampage in Kaduna State for the past few weeks, killing and abducting unsuspecting citizens in different communities and highways.
