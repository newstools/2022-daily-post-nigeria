Dr. Uche Ogah, the Nigerian Minister of State for Mines and Steel Development, and chieftain of the All Progressive Congress (APC), has declared that he will contest the governorship seat of Abia State in the upcoming general election in 2023. This is coming against the recent statement by a chieftain of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, Chikwe Udensi, wherein he claimed the serving minister had dumped the APC for the APGA in Abia State, and had also registered his membership at his Onuaku Uturu ward in Isiukwato Local Government Area of the State. The APGA leader also claimed that the minister had picked the gubernatorial nomination form of the party to vie for the seat under the platform. But Oga expressed dismay that some individuals were taking advantage of his good image to seek popularity on their inordinate ambition for power, ahead of the 2023 general election in Abia State. “I have no intention going to any other political party. I can tell you that some people are trying to use my good image to seek cheap popularity. “And I want to urge the people of Abia State and indeed, the general public to disregard what Chikwe Udensi said. He may have woken up from a wrong side of his bed. “I have not seen Chikwe Udensi for the past one year, so,bdon’t be surprised that some people will come out from rehabilitation centers and be talking what they like. “I’m the face of APC in Abia State, the bride of the people in the State, and anybody can use me to sell his party, which happens all the time”, Ogah submitted.
