Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has said leaders and members of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will rally behind whoever emerges as the party’s presidential candidate. Makinde made this disclosure on Thursday in Ibadan. He spoke when Akwa Ibom State governor and one of the presidential aspirants of the PDP, Mr. Udom Emmanuel, met party delegates from the South-West geopolitical zone. Makinde, while speaking, explained that the party has many qualified people among the presidential aspirants. He, however, added that the leaders will support whoever emerges at the primary election of the party ahead of the 2023 presidential election. He said that the PDP will rescue the country. Makinde said, “The good thing here is, we have so many qualified individuals within the PDP. My brother, others will come and at the end of the day, I believe the will of God is going to be done for Nigeria, our country. “You will go somewhere while some godfathers will endorse you and that will be all. But this is not the situation today. “This is PDP and after we have chosen the flagbearer, we are also still going to work together to rescue Nigeria. We will support whoever God has decided to give to us at this moment.”
