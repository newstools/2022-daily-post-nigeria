President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed sadness over the death of two officers in a Nigerian Air Force (NAF) plane crash in Kaduna. His message was conveyed Wednesday night in a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu. Flight Lieutenant, Abubakar Alkali and Flight Lieutenant Elijah Haruna Karatu died in the mishap. Buhari urged NAF to establish the cause(s) and publish reports on the accident, as well as others that occurred previously. The Nigerian leader said he was shocked beyond words by the demise of the promising young men who risked their lives. “There is no reward big enough to pay for the services of the dedicated professional airmen”, he noted. Extending sympathies to the Chief of Air Staff and the families of the deceased, Buhari called for more safety measures to forestall tragic incidents. “I call on them (NAF) to publish and implement the recommendations of the reports of past investigations into air accidents,” he said. The President believes this would prevent future tragedies and give closure to the families and friends of the late officers.
