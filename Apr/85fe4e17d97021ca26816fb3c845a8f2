Real Madrid goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois, has brushed off the boos from Chelsea’s fans during his side’s Champions League win against the Blues at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday. Chelsea lost 3-1 against Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-final first-leg tie in front of their home supporters. Karim Benzema’s hat-trick gave the LaLiga League leaders a first-leg advantage ahead of the second leg at the Santiago Bernabeu next week. Courtois, meanwhile, was booed by Chelsea fans during the first-leg tie. Asked about the hostile reception he received from Chelsea’s supporters, Courtois, a former Chelsea player, speaking to BT Sport, boasted that he won two Premier League titles during his time at the Premier League giants, adding that he knew his return to the Stadium would not be friendly. “Obviously, I knew it would not be friendly, especially in the stadium,” the Belgium international said. “Maybe if you see some people outside the ground, they will be more friendly. “It’s obviously part of football, that is unfortunate because how they painted my departure was not how it went through. “But I’m happy with the result and I will always care about the special moments here at the Bridge, two leagues… it’s not easy to win two Premier Leagues in four years, so I am happy for that and the moments here, so what happened today [the boos] I don’t take it too much,” he said.
