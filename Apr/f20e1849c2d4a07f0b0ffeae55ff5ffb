Cross River State government has hailed the installation of the new Seriki of the Hausas/Fulanis community in the state. Speaking on behalf of the government, the Director-General of the State Primary Healthcare Development Agency, Dr Janet Ekpenyong who alongside her team paid a courtesy visit, said the peaceful installation of Seriki Garba will consolidate the good relationship both parties have had in recent times. The installation follows the demise of the former Seriki Hausa. Ekpenyong said the partnership with leaders of the community has been a binding force between her agency, themselves and other supporting bodies to achieve maximum output in health care delivery for citizens and residents in the state. She said there has been greater and wider acceptance of health programmes in the community, especially the improved vaccination figures and indices of child and maternal mortality and morbidity. “The need to visit the new Seriki was to, among other things, congratulate him for being chosen to represent his people as well as to consolidate our very good relationship which has existed between both parties, particularly in the area of health interventions and the optimal utilization of health care facilities in their localities. ” As part of building the relationship, she disclosed that the state primary health agency will hold an event, tagged “Outbreak Response” (OBR1), a high impact intervention against Oral poliomyelitis for children between the ages of 0-59 months and other supplementary health services for mothers and the vulnerable. Responding, the new Seriki Hausa of Cross River State, praised Gov Ben Ayade for the all-inclusive representation in his government. He confirmed that his community has benefitted more from unlimited access to quality and effective health care. He promised to support the state Government in raising awareness of the dangers of Oral Polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases which affects children across the country.
