The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun has assured all aspirants of fairness ahead of the primaries for the 2023 general elections. State Chairman, Sikirulai Ogundele, who spoke at the official declaration of Jimi Lawal for the governorship ticket, said nobody can hijack the party. Lawal, a former aide to Kaduna Governor Nasir El-Rufai, joins Ladi Adebutu, David Bamgbose and Segun Sowunmi in the race. Ogundele stated that the platform would not stop eligible members from aspiring or contesting for any political office. “We thank God for the peace that we now enjoy in our party after the reconciliation”, NAN quoted him saying. “We will be transparent and fair in the selection of the flag bearers for the various political offices. “Let me allay fears over misconceptions concerning the activities in Ogun. The party is for all of us and nobody has pocketed it.” Ogundele vowed not to be a part of anything that will destroy the PDP in Ogun. The chairman urged all chieftains and members to support aspirants that emerge as candidates after the primary elections.
