Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has sent a message of condolence to his Rivers State counterpart, Nyesom Wike over the fire incident at Bonny Jetty in Port Harcourt that claimed several lives today. Several persons were said to have died from the inferno and others sustained various degrees of injuries. Ortom lamented over the tragedy which he said further added to the woes of security challenges facing the nation. He, however, urged his colleague to see the incident as a challenge that should be addressed by directing authorities concerned to always apply safety measures at all times. The Governor advocated for insurance cover for all public and private facilities, saying that such measures could mitigate or assuage the plight of victims. He extended his condolences to the immediate families of the deceased just as he asked authorities to see to the welfare of their dependants since they died in active service. The Governor added that the government and people of Benue State identify with the people of Rivers and share in their moment of grief.
