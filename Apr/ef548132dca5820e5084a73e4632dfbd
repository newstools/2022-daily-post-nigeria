Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State has said that President Muhammadu Buhari cannot hold an AK-47 rifle or be in every state of the federation to ensure the security of lives and property when there are chief executives in place in the states. The governor said this while challenging all governors in Nigeria to take responsibility for security in their states amid the security challenges facing the country. Bello said he did not expect the President to secure Kogi as a governor and had put a lot in place to bring crime to almost zero in his state. He stated this on Friday in Abuja at his Second Annual GYB Seminar for Nigeria’s Political and Crime Editors and Correspondents. “I’m not a governor that will expect the President to secure my state,” Bello said. “I refused to politicize insecurity. Buhari is a man who loves truth and reality. I’ll let you know that the President loves this country. “This insecurity isn’t a thing of the President though we should not pass the buck because that is why we came on board. It’s a successive failure of various administrations. “The President will not sit in the Villa and hold an AK-47 to come and secure my schools and roads. “Some of these crimes that we see today are more than what we see on the surface. I will never come out here and point out the flaws. Whatever I observe, in terms of loopholes and lapses, it’s between myself and the President to let him know. “I will never be that governor who will come out and say that the President didn’t secure my schools and roads.”
