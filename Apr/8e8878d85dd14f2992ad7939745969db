The Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has berated President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressive Congress, APC for failing to deliver campaign promises to Nigerians, saying Nigeria requires a president that can galvanise, take charge and fix its security and economic problems. He said Nigeria is blessed with so many intelligent people but requires a president that can harness their potential, improve the country’s economy and tackle insecurity. Governor Wike stated this on Tuesday when he visited the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Owerri, capital of Imo State to canvass support for his presidential ambition. He said, today Nigeria has a President that cannot move around but depends on his aides. Even when he is told that terrorists have taken charge of an international airport in the country. Wike urged the PDP leadership to stop giving party tickets to those who prefer to answer former presidential candidate of the party after losing election but to him who has no other party to go to. The Rivers State Governor assured the Imo PDP leadership that if given the party ticket he would go to war and win the 2023 election. “Nigeria needs somebody who will have the knowledge to fight insecurity, protect lives and property. I have the courage to overcome the various challenges of security, economic development and growth of the country.” “What Nigeria and PDP need now is results, whether I’m shouting or not gentle about it. We have suffered enough. If we don’t take power now it will be difficult to win election in Imo.” Responding, the State’s PDP Chairman, Chief Charles Ugwuh said that Wike’s consultative visit to Imo PDP allows them to hear from him, saying the PDP is blessed with an array of Presidential aspirants.
