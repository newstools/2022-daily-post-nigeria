The Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) has bombarded ISWAP commanders’ enclaves and training camps near Lake Chad. The aerial assault was led by the Nigerien Air Task Force at the Tumbun Rego axis in Borno State. An Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platform had discovered a large number of terrorists, a logistics and training camp. Also sighted were dozens of motorcycles and at least four vehicles parked under trees. The April 14 airstrikes eliminated ISWAP leaders including Ibn Usman, Hani Abdullahi, Abakar Shuwa, Abu Jibrillah and Abu Ali. “A mix of Nigerian Air Force and Nigerien Air Force aircraft attacked adjoining locations that served as havens of the fighters. “The airstrikes and the operations of ground troops led to the death of scores of terrorists and many others seriously injured”, an officer told PRNigeria. Mop-up operations were conducted on Friday by a Nigerian Army contingent under Operation Lake Sanity. The military says many terrorist locations in Sambisa Forest have been captured while an onslaught is ongoing in the Tumbuns.
