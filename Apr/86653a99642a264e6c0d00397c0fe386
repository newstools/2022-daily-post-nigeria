Oyo State coordinator of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) Mrs. Balikis Olawoyin has declared that FGM has no benefit. Olawoyin, who spoke on Friday in Ibadan, the State capital, revealed that FGM is harmful to the female child. Speaking at a training program organised for journalists on FGM, she said that FGM is extremely harmful to the body of girls and women. Olawoyin added that the negative effect of FGM is irreversible. The coordinator, while explaining that Oyo State is one of the States with highest prevalent rate of FGM, said that the training for the journalists from the print, online, electronic media and those from various ministries became necessary in order to sentisize members of the public on the negative effects of FGM. She said, “Female genital mutilation has no known benefit. It has immediate and age-long term consequences. “It is an extremely harmful practice. The damage caused is irreversible. The society thought that FGM is a way to protect women against being promiscuous, but we discovered that it does not. “We do not know when it started. It does not discourage women from being promiscuous. It has no benefit. So, the media should help us spread the message to the people at the grassroots. We appeal to the religious leaders, traditional rulers, men and women tell their families to stop this act”. A lawyer, Barrister Tolulope Adeoti, while speaking, said that FGM is a violation of the right of the female child. She said that all stakeholders must rise to stop the practice. Emmanuel Oni, who spoke on behalf of HACEY Health Initiative, explained that FGM is a crime in the State. He said that anyone caught engaging in FGM would be prosecuted in line with the recent laws passed in the State. “With these laws, the government has given us the go-ahead to officially prosecute any perpetrator of FGM. The passage of these laws has given us the support to work with security agencies to ensure that we bring this practice to an end,” he said.
