Labaran Maku, National Secretary of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) has dumped the platform. Maku defected to his former base, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The politician served as Minister of Information under President Goodluck Jonathan’s administration. Maku confirmed his defection to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Lafia. He said the decision was in response to the yearnings of the people of Nasarawa State. Maku left the PDP for APGA in 2015 after his unsuccessful attempt to clinch the PDP governorship ticket. He contested for the Nasarawa governorship position in 2015 and 2019 on the APGA ticket.
