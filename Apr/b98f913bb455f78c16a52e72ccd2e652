Former Rivers South-East Senator, Magnus Abe, has spoken on the crisis rocking the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers. He explained that it was not about the national convention of the party nor the South-south vice chairmanship position. Abe addressed APC stakeholders at the Freedom House in Port Harcourt, the capital. He said before the contest, members were aware that there was consensus among South-South leaders. “Everybody in Nigeria knew that consensus will not work in Rivers State and that is how it played out.” Abe confirmed that some people agreed that there should be a consensus and those who are not favoured by it should withdraw. “We decided that we will not withdraw because we wanted to make a point that consensus cannot be reached in Rivers without respect for members.” The former lawmaker said their position was why Worgu Boms did not step down for anybody. Abe further expressed satisfaction that his ally did not cry when he got to the podium.
