Former Liverpool defender, Jose Enrique, has hit out at Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo following the Red Devils’ Premier League 1-0 defeat to Everton on Saturday. Enrique said he doesn’t like Ronaldo because the Portugal captain believes he is a god and can do whatever he wants. Ronaldo was seen smashing a young fan’s phone following Man United’s defeat to Everton at Goodison Park, where he left the pitch seething. His actions have been hugely condemned by many, but the five-time Ballon d’ Or winner has since apologized on Instagram for the incident. Ronaldo wrote: “It’s never easy to deal with emotions in difficult moments such as the one we are facing. Nevertheless, we always have to be respectful, patient and set the example for all the youngsters who love the beautiful game. I would like to apologize for my outburst and, if possible, I would like to invite this supporter to watch a game at Old Trafford as a sign of fair-play and sportsmanship.” In reaction to the incident, Enrique wrote on Twitter: “I always said it. Don’t like him he believes is God and can do whatever he wants. That doesn’t take that is been one of the best players in the history of football but as a person I don’t like him.”
