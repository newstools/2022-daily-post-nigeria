The youth wing of apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo has urged Governor Charles Soludo of Anambra State to exercise restraint in his handling of the security situation in the State. DAILY POST reports that Anambra is witnessing rising security challenges shortly after Governor Soludo assumed office. He had offered amnesty to the unknown gunmen operating in the State and equally announced an end to the Monday sit-at-home. But the situation has since worsened, with several government facilities set ablaze and many security operatives killed. In a statement made available to journalists on Friday, the President-General of Ohanaeze Youth Council, OYC, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike said Soludo was worsening the situation by his unguarded utterances. Okwu said, “the OYC has keenly followed the recent developments in Anambra State since Prof. Charles Soludo took over as Governor. No day passes by without one unfortunate incident or the other being recorded in the State. “We also observed that the worsening situation is traceable to the Governor’s outbursts shortly after he was sworn-in as Governor. “One should have expected the Governor to first study the situation and begin to engage diplomatic moves than his quick orders on sit-at-home and amnesty for the agitators.” He called on Governor Soludo to restrain his steps to prevent more avoidable damage from befalling the State. “At this moment, we expect Prof. Soludo to talk less and do more of engagement. Letting his mouth open at every slightest opportunity would not do Anambra State and indeed the South-East any good. “The only amnesty is to collaborate with his colleagues and other South-East leaders in their push to get a political solution to this problem and see to the release of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu from detention,” Okwu further advised.
