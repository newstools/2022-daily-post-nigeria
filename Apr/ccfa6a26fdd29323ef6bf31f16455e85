The salary of the Super Eagles’ new coach has been revealed. According to Sporting Sun, the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has given the nod to appoint Portuguese coach Jose Peseiro as Super Eagles’ new coach. The report added that Peseiro would reportedly earn a monthly salary of $50,000. Peseiro will take over the Super Eagles coaching duties with two full-time assistants, a fitness coach and a match reader. The 62-year-old and the NFF are expected to finalise an agreement in the coming days. He will be assisted by the trio of Salisu Yusuf, Finidi George and Usman Abdalla. The NFF had recently announced that Augustine Eguavoen stepped down from his role as interim manager of the Super Eagles following Nigeria’s failure to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar later this year after losing to the Black Stars of Ghana. The NFF had named Peseiro as Super Eagles’ substantive head coach in December 2021, after sacking Gernot Rohr. Peseiro was expected to take charge of the Nigeria national team after the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cameroon. However, Eguavoen was given the Super Eagles job on an interim basis following Super Eagles’ elimination from the AFCON.
