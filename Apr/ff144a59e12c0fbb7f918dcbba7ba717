Popular Afrobeat singer, Seun Kuti has said if 14-year-olds are having sex, parents should begin early sex education. Kuti said this while reacting to the viral video of Chrisland students involved in filming adult content. He said everything in Nigeria is centred around sex and children are inundated with sexual images from songs to sex tapes online, therefore parents should stop “forming saints” and teach their children about sex. He said 14-year-olds had sex in his generation and that it was no surprise that the age has dropped for kids in this generation. His post on Instagram read: “ Everything in Nigeria is centred around sex. Children are inundated with sexual images. All the songs the media feeds them everything is hyper-sexualised. Sex tapes of their media role models are everywhere coupled with the internet. “Just start sex education early instead of forming saints. In my generation, most 14-year-olds were already doing it or planning to do it. I am not surprised the age dropped.”
