Abdullahi Adamu, the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has said the party would deploy either of the three strategies in its next Presidential primaries. Adamu disclosed that APC would use either direct, indirect primaries, or consensus in picking the party’s flagbearer in the next primary election. He disclosed this while fielding questions from State House Correspondents after his meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, yesterday. When asked on the next route for the party’s primaries, Adamu said: “When we get there, we’ll talk, alright? But the options are there; direct primaries, indirect, and consensus. The party has a choice which of these paths to take.” Some top Nigerians have declared to run for the Presidency on the platform of the APC. Politicians like Bola Tinubu, Rochas Okorocha, Orji Uzor Kalu, among others have declared to run for the Presidency.
