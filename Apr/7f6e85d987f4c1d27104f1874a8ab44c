President Muhammadu Buhari has been criticized for granting state pardons to former Governors of Plateau and Taraba States, Joshua Dariye and Rev. Jolly Nyame. Reno Omokri, a socio-political commentator, said Buhari pardoned Dariye and Nyame, who stole billions only to pursue and prosecute freedom fighters Nnamdi Kanu, Sunday Igboho and Sheikh Zakzaky. In a tweet via his handle on Friday, Omokri questioned Buhari’s action of pardoning Dariye and Nyame, adding that the President is also rehabilitating repentant Boko Haram terrorists. He tweeted: “Dear General Buhari, “You just pardoned Dariye and Nyame, who stole billions. “You are also rehabilitating repentant Boko Haramists. Yet, you are prosecuting Kanu, Igboho and Sheikh Zakzaky. How can you forgive thieves who are killers, only to pursue freedom fighters? On Thursday, the National Council of States, under the chairmanship of President Buhari, met in Abuja, considered and approved the state pardon for Dariye, Nyame and others. Dariye and Nyame were both jailed for stealing N1.16bn and N1.6bn, respectively. The two former governors, who are members of the All Progressives Congress, were convicted by Justice Adebukola Banjoko of the Abuja High Court in 2018. Dariye, who was Plateau Governor from 1999 to 2007, was sentenced to 14 years in prison. But his term was eventually reduced to 10 years by the Court of Appeal in Abuja, while his conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court. On his part, Rev Nyame, who was Taraba Governor from 1999 to 2007, was sentenced to 12 years in prison. The judgment was also upheld by the Supreme Court.
