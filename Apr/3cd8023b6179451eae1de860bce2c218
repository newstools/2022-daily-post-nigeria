Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has admitted that his Liverpool counterpart, Jurgen Klopp, is not his friend. However, the Spaniard made it clear he admires Klopp, who he claims has made him a better manager. Guardiola was speaking after their 2-2 draw with the Reds on Sunday. Both sides will meet again in the FA Cup semi-final next weekend. “I don’t know if Jurgen respects me but Jurgen has to know I respect him a lot. He has made me a better manager. “His team is always there, they are always aggressive. “We are not friends, we never see each other, I have his number but I don’t call him. “I have respect for him, but he knows next Saturday [in the FA Cup semi-final] I am going to try and beat him,” Guardiola said.
