Akwa Ibom State Governor, Mr Udom Emmanuel has said Nigeria needs sincere leaders with capacity and experience. He regretted that based on the constitution of the country, the minimum qualification for a person who wants to be the president of a country with over 200 million population is just WAEC, without experience. The governor made the assertion on Friday at the government house in Uyo. He described as unfortunate a situation when a Managing Director of a company is to be recruited, the employer would require an over three pages Curriculum Vitae while that of a president of a country with so much population would be only a Secondary School Certificate. He said, “if we are looking for an MD of a particular company, the CV we seek, spans 3-4 pages, but when we are looking for a President of the country, based on the constitution, all we need is WAEC, no experience.” The governor regretted that premium is not paid to the leader in whose hands lie the destiny of over 200 million people, as it is done for a managing director of a company that has only a few shareholders and stakeholders. He moved for certain things to be corrected in 2023 so that the country can move forward.
