Derby County manager, Wayne Rooney, has said Lionel Messi is the only player in the world that is not jealous of Cristiano Ronaldo. Rooney’s comments come after Ronaldo called him “jealous” for criticizing his second return to Manchester United. During his appearance on Monday Night Football this week, Rooney took aim at Ronaldo’s return to United and suggested that the 37-year-old does not offer enough when he’s on the pitch. Ronaldo replied “two jealous” in his response to his former United team-mate’s Instagram post. But when asked about Ronaldo’s comment on Thursday, Rooney replied: “I actually saw that this morning and I’d probably say that there’s probably not a football player on the planet who isn’t jealous of Cristiano. “The career he’s had, the trophies he’s won, the money he’s earned, his six-pack, his body. “I think every player, bar probably Lionel Messi, is jealous of Cristiano.”
