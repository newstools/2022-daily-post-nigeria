Real Madrid have finally reached a verbal agreement to sign Antonio Rudiger from Chelsea. According to football transfer expert, Fabrizio Romano, Rudiger will sign a long-term deal with Real Madrid in the coming days. Romano disclosed this in a tweet via his Twitter handle on Monday. He tweeted: “Real Madrid have reached a verbal agreement with Antonio Rüdiger. Contract not signed yet – but Real Madrid are now closing on Rüdiger deal on a free: here we go soon! “It’s gonna be a long-term deal. Final details to be discussed soon, before signing the contract.” Rudiger’s current contract with Chelsea will expire at the end of the season. Chelsea’s talks over an extension for Rudiger have been hampered by the sanctions placed by the UK Government.
