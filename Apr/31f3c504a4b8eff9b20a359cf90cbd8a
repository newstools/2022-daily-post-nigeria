Chelsea legend, John Terry, has expressed his admiration for Liverpool’s Luis Diaz. Diaz put in a scintillating performance in Liverpool’s Premier League 2-0 win against Everton on Sunday. The Colombian international was surprisingly left out of the starting line-up despite his impressive displays in recent weeks. Diaz came on as a substitute for Sadio Mane at the hour mark against Everton and produced a game-winning performance for Jurgen Klopp’s side. Liverpool dominated possession throughout the match but was unable to find the back of the net during a frustrating first half. However, two second-half goals from Andrew Robertson and Divock Origi gave the Reds all three points against Frank Lampard’s side. But Diaz’s skill and overall performance caught the eye of Terry. And Terry wrote on Twitter: “@Luis Diaz what a player this man is.”
