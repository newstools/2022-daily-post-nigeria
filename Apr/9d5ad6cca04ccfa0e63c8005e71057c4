The Federal Government has ordered that the Nigerian Railway Corporation, NRC, hand over the processing of train passengers to Secure ID. Secure ID is the technology firm controlling the e-ticketing platform for the Abuja-Kaduna rail service. Rotimi Amaechi, Minister of Transportation, stated that this decision would reduce crime, and security cases on the corridor and enable the firm to match faces with the names of passengers. The Minister said this in Abuja when the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) presented the Full Business Case Certificates (FBC) for Lagos- Ibadan and Itakpe-Warri e-ticketing service to him. “One thing I think I may disagree with the public on is the issue of tickets racketeering. I have spoken to the person in charge of Abuja-Kaduna to take over the identification process from NRC. “Because what the National Assembly told me was that NRC does not cross-check the ID of passengers on the tickets and they (Secure ID) had wanted to do it, but they have not gotten the approval from NRC. “So, I have told NRC to allow them do it, so that we match faces with the names. It’s not all about crime but it is also security, so we should release it to those security outlets,” he said. Amaechi concluded that this will reduce the danger of having to run into security crises.
