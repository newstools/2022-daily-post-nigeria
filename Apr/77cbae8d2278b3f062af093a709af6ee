The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has condemned the “provocative advertisement” of Sterling Bank during Easter. CAN described the comparison of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ to ‘Agege Bread’ as “ungodly, wicked and insensitive”. National Secretary, Joseph Daramola told Sterling Bank that the resurrection of Jesus affirms the immense power of God and should not be a joke. His statement on Wednesday noted that where Jesus was buried, it is boldly written; “He is no longer here, He has Risen!” “That is what we are celebrating at Easter and for Sterling Bank to compare it with a loaf of bread is blasphemous to the religion embraced by billions of people globally”, he wrote. CAN said Christians will not be provoked “not only because it is not in our character but it came from an uninformed mind”. The body further advised Christians to be wary of the banks and other financial institutions they patronize. The Advertising Practitioners Council of Nigeria (APCON) has reportedly intervened in the matter with a view to sanctioning Sterling Bank. CAN said it would wait for the decision and demanded the removal of the Chief Executive Officer, Abubakar Suleiman and the management team. The statement appealed to Christians not to take laws into their hands in seeking redress, but allow relevant authorities handle the matter.
