The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Monday arraigned Bolarinwa Abiodun, a fake Army General. Abiodun was docked before Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo of the Special Offences Court in Ikeja, the capital of Lagos. He faces a 13-count charge including obtaining money by false pretence, forgery of documents and possession of documents containing false pretence to the tune of N266,500,000. The offences violate Section 1 (3) of the Advance Fee Fraud and other Related Offences Act 2006; Section 363 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015 and Section 6 of the Advance Fee Fraud and other Related Offences Act No 14 of 2006. Abiodun, who posed as a General in the Nigerian Army, allegedly made false representations to the complainant, Kodef Clearing Resources. The defendant claimed that President Muhammadu Buhari shortlisted him and one other as nominees for Chief of Army Staff (COAS) position and that he needed a grant to “press and process the appointment”. Abiodun, arrested at his house in the Alagbado area of Lagos, on Wednesday January 12, 2022, allegedly forged a letter of appointment purportedly signed by the President. The defendant is alleged to have, in May 2020, forged a Nigeria Army ID card with serial number 387140, claiming it was issued by the Army. Abiodun also “forged a Letter of Recommendation” purportedly signed by ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo listing one Adebayo Rasaq Adebola, with recruitment No 77RRI/OG/556/0032555 and Adeogun Emmanuel Adesola with No 77RRI/OG/352/0123751 for employment into the Army. At the time of arrest, six pump action guns, three cartridge bullets, a swagger stick and several doctored documents were found in his possession. Abiodun pleaded “not guilty” to the charges when read to him. Prosecuting counsel, A.O. Muhammed, prayed the court for a trial date and for the remand of the defendant at a Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) facility. The defence counsel, Kayode Lawal informed the court of a summons for bail filed on behalf of Abiodun. Justice Taiwo adjourned till Thursday April 14, 2022 and ordered that the defendant be remanded at the Ikoyi prison.
