The Management of the Lagos State Waterways Authority (LASWA) on Tuesday denied the report of a boat mishap on the state Inland Waterways. Miss Wuraola Alake, Public Affairs Officer, LASWA, who gave the denial in a statement on Tuesday said video making rounds across social media of a boat of mishap was false. The report claimed that a boat mishap occurred at the Five Cowries Terminal this morning, April 26. But Alake said that the incident was actually a routine safety simulation exercise being carried out by the LASWA Emergency Rescue Team as part of their training exercise. She said that the training demonstration which took place in Lagos was part of LASWA safety preparedness against any possible incident on the State Inland Waterways. She, therefore, urged the general public to disregard the video, as it was done unprofessionally by an unknown source without proper Investigation and verification.
