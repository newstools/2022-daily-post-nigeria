An Ondo State High Court sitting in Akure, the state capital, has ordered the state government not to demolish structures at the state’s Trade Fair Complex. The state government was alleged to have already issued a quit notice to the owners of structures situated within the complex which is located on Igbatoro road, Akure. With the government already demolishing some of the structures, the owners of the structures objected to the government’s move, claiming that their rent on the site had not yet expired. Some business owners within the complex had earlier raised the alarm over the development as they accused the government of acting illegally despite that their rents were still running. To that purpose, the claimants had filed an interim injunction to prevent further demolition through their counsel, Mr Olumide Ogidan. Ogidan had previously asked the court to halt the destruction pending the outcome of an interlocutory injunction motion. The Ondo State government, the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, as well as the Commissioner for Commerce, Investment, and Corporative Services, are also defendants in the case. In his judgement Justice Adegboyega Adebusoye, granted the application restraining the defendants from continuing with the demolition pending the hearing of application for interlocutory injunction which will come up on April 25, 2022.
