Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Russia will respond ‘lightning-fast’ if any country intervenes in Ukraine amid the ongoing war between both nations. Putin, who boasts that Russia has all tools, gave the warning on Thursday during an address to lawmakers in St Petersburg. DAILY POST reports that this is coming less than 48 hours after Putin said Russia and Ukraine managed to achieve a “serious breakthrough” during talks in Istanbul, Turkey but the situation changed “dramatically” after the allegations against Russia for crimes in the Ukrainian town of Bucha. Both neighbouring countries have been fighting for almost two months since Putin declared the invasion of Ukraine in February due to political differences. Several casualties have already been recorded as a result of the war. “If someone intends to intervene in the ongoing events (in Ukraine) from the outside and creates unacceptable strategic threats for us, then they should know that our response to those strikes will be swift, lightning-fast,” Putin said. He added, “We have all the tools for this — ones that no one can brag about. And we won’t brag. We will use them if needed. And I want everyone to know this.” Putin, however, did not provide further details on the “tools” he was referring to. “All the decisions have been made in this regard,” Putin told lawmakers, promising to achieve “all the goals” of the Russian “special operation” in Ukraine.
