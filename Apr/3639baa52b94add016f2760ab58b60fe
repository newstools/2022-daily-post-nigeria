Former Liverpool and Wales striker Dean Saunders has sympathised with Chelsea striker, Romelu Lukaku over his recent struggles at Stamford Bridge. Sounders explained just how difficult these moments can be for a goalscorer, adding that the player may sometimes be seeing snakes on the pitch instead of balls. “He [Lukaku] has lost all his confidence, all his self belief,” added the talkSPORT pundit. Lukaku, who left Chelsea as a youngster, joining Everton and Manchester United before moving to Italy, where he won the Serie A with Inter Milan, returned to Stamford on a £97.3million deal last summer. The Belgium international, who started brightly under Thomas Tuchel, has faded into a bit-part player in recent months, starting only two games against lower-league opponents. Lukaku has lost his striker position to Kai Havertz and came off the bench in the 77th minute during the Blues’ 2-0 FA Cup semi-final win over Crystal Palace on Sunday. Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Mason Mount scored for Chelsea, who will now face Liverpool in the final at Wembley. Lukaku had the opportunity to put his name on the score sheet but sent a glorious chance cannoning off the post.
