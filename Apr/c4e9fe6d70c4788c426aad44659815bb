Sergeant Haruna Muhammad Funtua, one of the victims of the Kaduna-Abuja bombed train has died. According to a family source, Funtua sustained a head injury from the bandits’ gunshot and was taken to the hospital for treatment. But he was pronounced dead. DAILY POST recalls that bandits had attacked the Kaduna-Abuja train with over 300 passengers. Eight were confirmed dead, while 26 other passengers sustained gunshot injuries. Many Nigerians had immediately donated blood for the aid of gunshot victims as the hospital blood bank had insufficient blood. For some weeks now, bandits have not given Kaduna residents a breathing space as they kidnap at will, demanding large sums as ransom from the families of their victims. They had attacked Kagoro, killed several people, and kidnapped scores. Days after, they attacked nine villages in the Giwa Local Government Area of the state, kidnapped several people and killed scores.
