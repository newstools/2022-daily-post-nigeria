A legal practitioner, Kayode Ajulo, has faulted the comment by Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, on engaging foreign mercenaries to fight terrorists in Nigeria. His statement on Monday in Abuja warned that the option could have severe consequences. Ajulo stressed that the pillar of national security was to safeguard Nigerian sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. The constitutional lawyer said any country or federating state that fails to ensure the safety of its citizens will be regarded as a failure. He lamented the high rate of killings, bombing, kidnapping, robberies and conflicts in the country. Ajulo said though El-Rufai ‘s position could be justified due to the demand for a strong response to the atrocities in Kaduna, he must tread with caution. “The existing security framework has shown that there is no clear chain of command, making it difficult for the security authorities to deal with the rising wave of insecurity. “However, one must not shy away from the dire consequences of the attempt to engage the services of foreign mercenaries to combat insurgency in the state,“ he said. Ajulo cited instances where mercenaries have been used to topple the government and cause anarchy in a sovereign state. The lawyer stressed that this was the major reason nations are wary of inviting mercenaries and private military companies to handle internal security.
