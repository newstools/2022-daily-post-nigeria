President of the United Church of Christ in Nigeria (HEKAN), Rev. (Dr.) Amos G. Kiri, on Sunday, urged Nigerians to be security conscious, anywhere they are. He also urged Nigerians to join hands to step up the fight against bandits and kidnappers in the country. Rev. Amos spoke with journalists at the end of 56th Hekan Annual National Convention, in Kaduna on Sunday The cleric averred that he was saddened that hardly a day passes in this country without the sad news of the killings of innocent Nigerians either by kidnappers; bandits, unknown gunmen, ritualists, among others. Rev. Amos, who praised security operatives for their efforts in tackling insecurity, noted that the bandits seem to be having their field day, adding that more efforts need to be intensified. Rev. Amos, while frowning at the recent killings in Kaduna, advised residents in the state to always report strange faces to security agencies “Oftentimes, I have said that these heartless people are not invisible and invincible; they have human bodies and mingle with us daily,” he said. According to him, “The government should properly equip our security personnel with technological devices that have capacity to monitor the movement of these criminals perpetrating evil,” adding that their movements should be monitored, while those caught should face the wrath of the law. He warned those aiding, sponsoring and financing banditry to desist, stressing that those caught should face appropriate punishment. The cleric also comforted those that lost their loved ones during bandits’ attack, just as he prayed that the souls of those who have departed this world find eternal rest with the Lord.
