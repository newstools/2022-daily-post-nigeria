Arsenal striker, Alexandre Lacazette, has admitted he has been in talks with other clubs ahead of the summer transfer window. Lacazette’s current contract at the Emirates runs out at the end of this campaign. The Frenchman is widely expected to leave the Premier League and has now said he wants a return to Champions League football. “I’m in discussion with a lot of clubs, I’m open,” Lacazette told Canal Plus. The 30-year-old has refused to rule out returning to his former side Lyon, whom he left in 2017 to join Arsenal. However, Lyon are out of the Champions League spots in Ligue 1 in seventh, six points behind third-placed Rennes, who occupy the playoff spot. “I never cut contact with Lyon since I left. Now Lyon know that I’m free, they’ve come by the information. “It’s a bit more complicated. I want to play in Europe. It’s been a long time since I’ve played in the Champions League, I miss it. “Nothing is impossible in life, but it’s a bit more complicated,” Lacazette added.
