Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode has alerted that Enugu Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi is a target of promoted attacks by his rivals in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The former presidential aide said that though were in different political parties, he could corroborate “the integrity and decency of one of my dearest friends and brothers”. In a statement on Monday, he noted that the baseless allegations being peddled are totally unbecoming of “the identifiable individual” behind them. “When you see a lie you have a duty before man and God to expose it for what it is and shoot it down,” Fani-Kayode wrote. “That is decency and justice and it does not matter whether you and the object or target of such perfidious mendacities are on the same side of the political divide or not.” He said premeditated lies, coupled with a heavy dosage of libel and slander against fellow human beings, diminish everyone. The former minister advised Nigerians to eschew the politics of hate, division and renounce persons who try to bring down those seen as an obstacle to their political aspirations. Fani-Kayode further disclosed that he had conversations with the governor about him leaving the PDP for the All Progressives Congress (APC). “There is nothing that I did not do or say to try to get him to leave the PDP and join the APC but he simply refused to do so. “I respect his decision and the fact that we are in different parties does not mean I cannot vouch for him when others in his own party are trying to destroy him,” he said. Fani-Kayode advised masterminds of the smear campaign to know that it does not serve them well to attempt to disparage “one of the brightest stars in the East and Nigeria”.
