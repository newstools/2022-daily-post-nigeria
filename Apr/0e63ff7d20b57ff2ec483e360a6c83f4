An All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain, Paul Okorie, has described the endorsements of aspirants for elective offices as undemocratic. The former Commissioner for Housing and Transportation in Ebonyi spoke to reporters in Abakaliki on Wednesday. Okorie said democratic practices dictate that people be allowed to choose their preference in open and free contests. He spoke in reaction to the alleged endorsement of Francis Nwifuru, an APC governorship aspirant, Governor Dave Umahi. Okorie noted that anyone who wants to lead should subject himself to scrutiny and not hide under anybody or people to push him through. He said aspirants should not short-change others or use shortcuts, but leave themselves open for the people to assess on the basis of their antecedents and character. “The alleged endorsement is undemocratic and runs counter to the democratic principles of fair play, transparency, equity and free contests. “I do not see why a person who wants to preside over the affairs of a state or constituency will be looking to be endorsed as a consensus candidate”, NAN quoted him saying. Okorie, who vied for Ebonyi governorship ticket twice, added that power belongs to the people and not to one person or group of individuals.
