Shehu Sani, a former Kaduna Central Senator, has reacted to Pastor Enoch Adeboye of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG’s remark regarding the 2023 elections. Sani described Pastor Adeboye’s remark as a missile. The General Overseer of RCCG had said the 2023 election may not hold. Adeboye had said he is still in doubt as to whether the general elections would hold in 2023. Papa G.O. as he is fondly called said God has not revealed to him if elections would hold in 2023. He, however, added that God might still speak to him. Reacting, Sani tweeted: “When I saw the missiles I thought it was from Bishop Kukah or Father Mbaka then I found out it’s from Pastor Adeboye. “Many religious clergies lose their gospel voice or dilutes their sermons when the oppressor is of their faith or denomination.”
