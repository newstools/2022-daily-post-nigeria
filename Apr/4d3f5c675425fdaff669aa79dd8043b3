Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State has said that if the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Asiwaju Bola Tinubu was a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) he would have been given the party presidential ticket. Mohammed, who is also a PDP presidential aspirant, said despite being an aspirant, he has great admiration for Tinubu. Speaking as a guest on AriseTV, Mohammed commended Tinubu for the formation of the APC and noted that if not for him, Buhari would not have been President. “I was lucky I met Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, (vice president) Osinbajo we discussed, he (Tinubu) called me consensus. “I told him (Tinubu), if you were in PDP, we would have given you the (presidential) ticket because we know that without you, (Muhammadu) Buhari wouldn’t have been the president. “In PDP, we recognise contribution. We have people in Nigeria that we must recognise and it was definitely a good outing for me.”
