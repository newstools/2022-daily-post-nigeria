Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba has assured the public that the security agency was making progress in the probe of Osinachi Nwachukwu’s death. The demise of the famous gospel musician caused public outcry with citizens and organizations demanding a thorough investigation. At a meeting with Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen at his office in Abuja on Wednesday, the IGP said the singer’s death was heart-breaking. He revealed that information from sources close to the family and independent witnesses fingered Osinachi’s husband, Peter Nwachukwu, as being responsible for her death. Baba said the FCT Command, in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred, arrested Peter at about 5pm on April 10 at their residence in Lugbe, Abuja. The suspect is currently in the custody of the Command as investigations proceed. The IGP emphasized that considering the sensitive nature of the case and the need to get justice, the command has approached the National Hospital in Abuja for post-mortem examinations. Baba said this would ascertain the cause of death, and Peter will be charged to court as soon as it is established that he was responsible for her death. The Police chief added that it is both illegal and immoral for anyone human to take the life of another in any manner. He reiterated the commitment of the Force to ensure that domestic violence, sexual and gender-based violence, rape, and others are accorded utmost attention, while the perpetrators are made to face the law.
