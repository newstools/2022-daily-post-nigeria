President Muhammadu Buhari has hailed a former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, describing him as the voice of the voiceless. A statement signed by Femi Adesina said that Buhari joins leaders and members of the APC in celebrating with the former Governor of Edo State, on his 70th birthday, April 4, 2022. The President congratulated Oshiomhole on another milestone, saluting his salutary “contributions to development of democracy and good governance.” Buhari said he believes “Oshiomhole’s leadership strides in various sectors will stand the test of time, deploying his time and strength to the good of workers and Nigerians as a labour leader, Chairman of the Nigerian Labour Congress, and accepting the call into politics to serve his state.” He noted the “mental soundness and experience of the former APC leader, willingly dedicating himself for the greater good of the country, and acting as the voice of the voiceless in different ramifications.” As the former Governor turns 70, Buhari prayed for good health, and continued service to God and humanity.
