National Security Adviser (NSA) Babagana Monguno said he never accused Kaduna Governor Nasir El-Rufai of disclosing classified information on terrorism. The NSA spoke on Friday through, Zakari Usman, Head of Strategic Communication in his office. Monguno had on Thursday addressed the media after the Security Council Meeting chaired by President Muhammadu Buhari. A statement by Usman noted that Monguno, a retired Major General, was quoted “out of context”. “The NSA did not at anytime during the briefing criticize and accuse Governor Nasir El Rufai of divulging classified information”, it reads. Usman said the NSA was not referring to the Kaduna helmsman in his comment on the protection of sensitive operational information. He clarified that Monguno, while responding to a question, cautioned security agents who are “in the habit of revealing unauthorized sensitive operational details”. The statement said El-Rufai “has been a consistent and exemplary partner to the security sector” and the NSA would not discredit him.
