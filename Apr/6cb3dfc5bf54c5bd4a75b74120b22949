Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has demanded more support from the Stamford Bridge crowd when the Blues face Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-final first-leg tie on Wednesday. Recall that the atmosphere at Stamford Bridge was flat during Chelsea’s Premier League 4-1 defeat to Brentford over the weekend. Speaking at his pre-match press conference on Tuesday, Tuchel said: “We absolutely need it and we need to be better on the pitch, we are the first to admit it but we need the crowd to be better, the supporters to be better. “We need everybody on the front foot, it’s a big match, the quarter-finals and it’s a big opponent and it’s a big occasion. “Normally we have this kind of atmosphere in the evening games and big matches throughout the season when the spectators are back in, like the Champions League matches, which gave us a huge push in terms of atmosphere and in terms of energy and we need it. It’s crucial in these games. “We feel it in every away game, when you play in Turin, Malmo, Saint Petersburg and Lille, it’s super hard. “It’s much harder to play against the spectators and we will face it next week in Madrid. “Everybody needs to be on top level, we need to be the first one to set the spark, but everyone needs to arrive tomorrow ready to support.”
