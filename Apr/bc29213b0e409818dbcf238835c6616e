Former Nigeria international, Vincent Enyeama, has urged Super Eagles goalkeeper, Francis Uzoho, to stay strong and never give up. Enyeama said this while reacting to Uzoho taking all blame for Nigeria’s failure to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Uzoho had taken all the blame for Nigeria’s failure to qualify for the 2022 World Cup.  He also promised to make sure he returned the smiles on the faces of Nigerian supporters. Recall that it was Uzoho’s error that gave the Black Stars of Ghana their only goal at the MKO Abiola Stadium last month, which denied Nigeria a place in Qatar in November, 2022. A shot from Arsenal’s Ghana captain Thomas Partey squirmed under his body and went into the net and Uzoho was disappointed with himself. Following the disappointment of not qualifying for the 2022 World Cup, Uzoho took to his Instagram handle to express his regrets. He wrote, “The past couple of days have been the worst in my lifetime. I wanted to take my nation to Qatar but rather did the opposite.” However, replying to Uzoho’s post, Enyeama wrote on Monday: “Never give up dear. we’ve all been through it. Stay strong. better days ahead. You have a very good team.”
