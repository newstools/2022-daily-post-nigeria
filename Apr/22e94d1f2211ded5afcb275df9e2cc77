Former Chelsea striker, Tony Cascarino, has insisted that Alexandre Lacazette’s lack of goals so far this season is an issue for Arsenal. Cascarino believes Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, needs to replace Lacazette when his contract with the Gunners expires at the end of this season. Lacazette has scored six times in 31 games across all competitions and just four times in 25 Premier League matches. And Cascarino believes those numbers are simply not good enough for Arsenal. Speaking to talkSPORT, Cascarino said: “Lacazette is probably the lowest scoring centre forward. He’s got four Premier League goals this season. Obviously, he’s been in and out of the team at times, but he’s played 25 games in the Premier League now and he’s got four goals.” He added, “Lacazette is an issue. His contract is up in the summer and that’s an area they [Arsenal] need to fill. You cannot do anything in football having a centre-forward that’s got four, five or six goals in a season.”
