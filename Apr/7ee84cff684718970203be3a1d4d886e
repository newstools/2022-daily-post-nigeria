Manchester United legend, Gary Neville, has branded the club ‘a joke’ after they slipped to a damaging defeat against relegation-threatened Everton at Goodison Park on Saturday. Everton were a point above relegation zone following Wednesday’s defeat at Burnley United struggled to make any effort after Anthony Gordon’s 27th minute opener for Everton. Everton goalkeeper, Jordan Pickford, made a sharp late save to deny Cristiano Ronaldo what would have been a scarcely deserved equaliser. “United a joke,” Neville wrote on Twitter after the game. “Well done to Everton. Would have also been hard for Frank Lampard to hear Sean Dyche say what he said so well done to him. Some response.” Everton matchwinner Gordon, told reporters, “You can see by the results we get here. We definitely feed off the fans and are a better team with them. “They are a top team with top players at the front end of the pitch so we did really well to keep a clean sheet. “The gaffer always says you make your own luck by working hard and winning the ball back. I made my own luck with a bit of hard work. “I can only speak for myself but I’m really sore and have had a few kicks.”
