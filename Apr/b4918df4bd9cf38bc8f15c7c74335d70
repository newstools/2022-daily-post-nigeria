President Muhammadu Buhari has advised his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan not to be discouraged by the recent accident that happened in Abuja, especially as it regards his peacebuilding efforts. Recall that Ex-President Goodluck Jonathan narrowly escaped death as his convoy was involved in an accident near the Abuja airport. But two of his aides were not too lucky as they died in the incident. Buhari’s condolence message came through Femi Adesina, his media aide on Friday. Buhari said he joined fellow countrymen in praying for the repose of the deceased aides of the former President and urged their families to see their demise as a sacrifice for the nation. “Let me express gratitude to Almighty God for having President Jonathan escape unhurt from the accident, but not to be distracted from his frequent local and international travels which are linked to peacebuilding at home and abroad,” Buhari said in his condolence message.
