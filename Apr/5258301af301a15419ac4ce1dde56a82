The police in Ogun State said they have arrested no fewer than 37 suspected cult members terrorising the state. DAILY POST reports that cult clashes between the Eiye and Aiye confraternities claimed the lives of about 15 persons in Abeokuta and Sagamu, including Tommy, a popular area boy killed in the Panseke area of the state capital, on March 24. On Sunday, the Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said two of the suspects, said to be members of the dreaded Aiye cult group were arrested in the early hours of the day, in different locations. The two suspects, who were identified by Oyeyemi as Habeeb Muideen (aka Oko 8) and Ibrahim (aka Ayin), were taken in following a distress call received by SWAT operatives. According to Oyeyemi, the group members were engaging in a supremacy battle with another rival cult group at the Iberekodo axis of the Abeokuta metropolis. “Upon the distress call, the Commander of SWAT, CSP Kalejaye Olanrewaju, quickly led his men to the scene. “On sighting the policemen, the cultists ran to different directions but were hotly chased and Habeeb Muideen was arrested at Iberekodo, while Ibrahim was apprehended at Ajitadun area of the metropolis,” Oyeyemi revealed. He added that the two suspects are being interrogated at the SWAT office to determine their roles in the clash, which he said left one Eiye member dead. He added that battle axes and assaulted charms were recovered from the suspects. “Not less than 37 members of the various cult group have been arrested in the last one month when the command started clamping down on cultists across the state,” Oyeyemi stated, saying the Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, has ordered a comprehensive manhunt for the fleeing members of the groups.
