UEFA, on Wednesday night, revealed Champions League all-time top scorers. The Europe football governing body released a list of the top ten all-time highest goal scorers in a post via its Twitter handle following the completion of this season’s quarter-final first-leg fixtures on Wednesday. Recall that Real Madrid defeated Chelsea 3-1 at Stamford Bridge, thanks to Karim Benzema’s hat-trick, while Villarreal won 1-0 against Bayern Munich.
