Aloy Ejimakor, Special Counsel to Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has advised the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government on a step to take towards his client. Ejimakor said the Buhari-led Federal Government should dialogue and abandon the trial of Kanu. The Special Counsel informed the Federal Government that dialogue is amicable. Ejimakor made the remark while quoting a section of the Federal High Court Act. In a tweet, he wrote: “Sec. 17 of Federal High Court Act (Reconciliation in civil & CRIMINAL cases) says: “In any proceedings in the Court, the Court may promote RECONCILIATION among the parties thereto & encourage & facilitate the AMICABLE settlement thereof”. Dialogue is amicable. Trial is not. #MNK.” The Nigerian Government has a seven-count charge against the IPOB leader before Justice Binta Nyako of an Abuja Federal High Court. The charges, which were initially 15 counts, had eight struck out by Justice Nyako. The judge struck out counts six, seven, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.
