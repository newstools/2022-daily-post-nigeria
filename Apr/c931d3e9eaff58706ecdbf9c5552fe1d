Nigerian singer, Divine Ikubor, popularly known as Rema has lamented over the lingering Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU strike. ASUU embarked on a one-month warning strike on February 14th and extended it by another two months, over the alleged failure of the government to fulfil its agreements. Students have been at home since then waiting for the strike to be called off. Rema who had earlier disclosed he got admission to study at the University of Lagos, UNILAG, on Monday urged ASUU to call off the strike. He lamented that he has not started schooling since he got the admission. The 21-year-old star said this via this Twitter handle. His tweet read: “ASUU, since dem give me admission I never start school o, e don do nau! Meanwhile, Chris Ngige, the Minister of Labour and Employment, at his last meeting with ASUU told the union to look for better ways to pressurize the ministry of Education rather than embarking on strike. The minister noted that he has no control over the current impasse between the Federal Government and the ASUU, adding that things are above his control because he’s not the Minister of Education.
