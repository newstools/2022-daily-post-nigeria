For the second time, the planned arraignment of Omoyele Sowore on cybercrime charges was on Monday in Abuja aborted due to the ongoing Easter vacation of the Federal High Court. The Federal Government filed three-count criminal charges against Sowore, a presidential aspirant in the 2023 presidential election. The filing of the criminal charges followed complaints to the Federal Government by a businessman, Mr Ned Nwoko. Sowore was initially to take his plea on the charges on Wednesday, March 16 but the arraignment stalled due to the inability of the Federal Government to serve the charges on Sahara Reporters as required by law. This prompted Justice Emeka Nwite to shift the arraignment to Monday, April 25. However, although Sowore was personally present in court today having been served with the charges, the arraignment could not be conducted due to the absence of the trial Judge, Justice Emeka Nwite. Lawyers in the matter were informed that the Federal High Court was still on Easter vacation and were also told to pick a fresh date for the arraignment. After extensive consultations, the lawyers in the matter agreed on June 2 for the arraignment. Sahara Reporters, an online medium, was charged as 2nd defendant along with its publisher, Sowore in the criminal charges. At today’s proceedings, Emmanuel Inegbenoise stood for the Federal Government while Mr Tope Temokin appeared for Sowore.
