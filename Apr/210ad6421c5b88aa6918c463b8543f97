The All Progressives Congress (APC) national chairman, Abdullahi Adamu says the party has received President Muhammadu Buhari’s “order” on the 2023 elections in Nigeria. The leader spoke on Friday after receiving his certificate of return from the Chairman of the Convention Planning Sub-Committee, Governor Mohammed Badaru. Adamu noted that the committee conducted its assignments in a “very efficient, honest and equitable manner”. The ex-Nasarawa Governor said APC has zero tolerance for failure under the new dispensation because claiming the party has an enormous responsibility ahead. “On the coming elections, we cannot move the way we are to an election. We have a marching order from the leader of this party, President Muhammadu Buhari. “We will have to deliver, there will be no excuses whatsoever and we need every hand on deck for this to happen”, the Senator said. Adamu disclosed that Buhari’s guidance and appeal to party members to embrace consensus has helped the Election Committee to do their job easily. “There were 78 positions contested for the NEC members and the zonal executives. The consensus was achieved in 66 positions. “This demonstrates the fact that the APC is indeed one family and the members will always listen to President Buhari and his call for peace and unity”, the Jigawa helmsman added.
