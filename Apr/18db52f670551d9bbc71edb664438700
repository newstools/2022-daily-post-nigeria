A downpour in Kaduna on Saturday night has destroyed properties worth millions of naira. The rain that lasted for over an hour, came with windstorms, removing many roofs, falling fences in various communities in the state. A resident, whose roof was removed during the downpour in Kurmi Gwari, Kaduna South Local Government Area, Mr. Jeremiah Danlami described the experience as unexpected. “The house I live in is just four years old. It was built with new zinc. During the downpour, I have no knowledge that the entire roof will remove. I was sitting with my family in the palour. All of a sudden, everywhere became cleared and we began to see stars. Heavy rain descended on me and my family. We were all soaked with water, all my certificates, clothes, and chairs were soaked,” he said. Also, Dr. Samuel Amuta who fenced his house said it fell on top of his car parked inside the compound. According to him, his car was smashed beyond recognition. In Kakuri, Kaduna South Local Government, a church building roof was removed during the downpour as the wind blew away the entire roof. Although the church pastor was not available to comment, church members were seen arranging benches and chairs as early as 6.00 am on Sunday for early morning mass.
