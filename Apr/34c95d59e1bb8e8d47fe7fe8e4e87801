WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange may be close to being transported to the United States for trial under the Espionage Act. Assange is wanted in America to answer 18 criminal charges over WikiLeaks publications. In 2010, the portal published thousands of classified files and diplomatic cables that shook the world. On Wednesday, a London court sent an extradition order to the British Government for approval, CNN reports. It is expected that UK Home Secretary, Priti Patel will endorse the transfer of the fugitive to the US after many years of a legal battle. Assange, who can appeal the decision, joined the hearing virtually from the Belmarsh Prison in London. The defendant has been at the facility since he was taken from the Ecuadorian embassy in London in April 2019. Citing his mental health, a Magistartes’ court, in January 2021, decided that Assange could not be extradited as it would be “oppressive”. The High Court overturned the ruling in December because the U.S. Government assured Assange would get fair treatment. America said he would not be made the subject of “special administrative measures,” nor be held at a maximum-security prison before or after trial. In March, 50-year-old Assange married his long-term partner Stella Moris inside Belmarsh prison.
