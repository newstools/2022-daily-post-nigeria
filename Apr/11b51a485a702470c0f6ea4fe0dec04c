He further disclosed that a suspect in connection to the incident had been arrested by the police. According to the relative, “The deceased lecturer was about to complete his PhD before the sad incident. “The death of Sani has indeed shocked everyone of us, but we believe that Allah has permitted that he would no longer be with us anymore.” He confirmed that both victims were buried Tuesday morning, according to Islamic rites. “We pray Allah forgive them. Sani was a very jovial and friendly person,” he lamented.
