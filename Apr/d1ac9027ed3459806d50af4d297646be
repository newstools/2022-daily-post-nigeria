Immediate past Governor of Adamawa State, Senator Jibrilla Bindow, has declared intention to seek a return to Government House come 2023. Bindow, who was the state governor between 2015 and 2019 under All Progressives Congress (APC), said Monday that he would be seeking the party’s ticket for the 2023 governorship election. Bindow, who first made his formal declaration at the state APC Secretariat in Yola Monday afternoon, later granted an interview to newsmen at his house, within the Jimeta metropolis of Yola, stressing that he had lessons from his first term that will prove useful if he gets the chance for another term. “I am a man of infrastructure. Infrastructure not only in terms of roads but infrastructure in other areas,” Bindow said. “I will declare state of emergency on education and water if I become the next governor, Bindow said. He appealed to the APC to give him the party’s ticket for a chance to consolidate on the achievements he made on his first coming as governor, as he is better placed now to deliver on governance. Senator Jibrilla Bindow, who in 2019 lost to the present Governor, Ahmadu Fintiri of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in circumstances widely blamed on internal wrangling within APC, is believed still to be best placed within the APC to face the incumbent PDP governor who, incidentally, also formally declared rerun bid earlier on Monday.
