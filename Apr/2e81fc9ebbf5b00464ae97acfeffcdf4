A Former Governor of Kaduna State, Mukhtar Yero, has called on stakeholders in the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to unite themselves ahead of the 2023 general elections to enable the party sweep polls. Yero, who made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Kaduna, said the party may lose the elections if the members fail to unite. He said it was imperative for the party members to unite to win upcoming elections in the country. He said, “It is important for the PDP family to come together to rescue the country. “We must eschew all bitterness and put personal interests aside and look at the collective interest of Nigerians as well as the party. “So that when Nigeria becomes a better country, all of us will rejoice and will be happy with the situation. “But if we continue to fight each other and only promote our personal interests, we will end up losing.” Yero also admonished the youths to use the 2023 elections to establish themselves as “true leaders of tomorrow.”
