A group of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 2023 presidential aspirants seeking a consensus candidate has said contrary to speculations, the consensus move is not a northern agenda, but a collective effort to rescue Nigeria. The aspirants include former President of the Senate, Sen. Bukola Saraki, Gov. Mohammed Bala of Bauchi State, Gov. Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State and a businessman, Muhammad Hayatu-Deen Speaking on behalf of the aspirants after they met with Enugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi in Abuja, on Tuesday, they assured that all PDP aspirants from North and South will meet to decide on it. Saraki explained that “When we started about three weeks ago, most of the aspirants we had then were mainly in the north. We are talking to aspirants across the country now, because more people have come out in the South and we are all going to meet.” Saraki continued, “All the aspirants are going to meet. We are talking about Nigeria. We are not talking about the northern aspirants or southern aspirants. “I have good news that already, moves are being made by the aspirants in the South to meet and eventually, we all will meet and see one consensus, that consensus is a Nigerian that represents all the groups. “So, I just want to be clear about that, and be reassured it is not just about the issue of a northern consensus, not at all, it’s a consensus for the PDP and one Nigeria.” Saraki stressed that the move will also help unite all the aspirants to ensure that they take over the government in 2023. In his brief remarks, Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State said that he believed in justice, equity and fairness in arriving at a consensus candidate.
