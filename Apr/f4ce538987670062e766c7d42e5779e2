Following calls for the former President, Goodluck Jonathan to run for the 2023 presidential election, he is reportedly in a meeting with some stakeholders. DAILY POST reports that there has been speculation that the former president who lost to President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015 is nursing an ambition to return to power. A source told DAILY POST on Friday, that Jonathan who has kept mum on the speculation, may clear the air after the meeting. Some of his supporters had earlier stormed his Abuja residence in protest, asking him to declare for the 2023 presidency. The protesters, who were mostly women, wielded placards and banners with inscriptions such as ‘Goodluck Jonathan must run for president 2023′, “Jonathan is our candidate’, among others.
