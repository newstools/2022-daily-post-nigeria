Erik ten Hag has picked former Arsenal striker, Robin van Persie as his assistant at Manchester United. The Dutchman, who wants to work with a majority of his countrymen at Old Trafford, had earlier picked Mitchell van der Gaag as another assistant. All is set for the 52-year-old Hag to take over as manager at Old Trafford in the summer. The Mirror reports that the Dutchman has already decided to bring Van der Gaag, who is currently his assistant at Ajax. Van Persie, who also played for Manchester United towards the end of his career, would also be part of Ten Hag’s backroom staff at United. It is thought that Van Persie is undecided about the offer with family ties back in Holland at the forefront of his decision making. Robin van Persie spent three years at Manchester United as a player.
