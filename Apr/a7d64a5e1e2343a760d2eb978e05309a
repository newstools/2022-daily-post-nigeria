Former Chelsea winger, Pat Nevin has given his verdict on the Blues’ Champions League tie with Real Madrid. Chelsea will host Real Madrid in the Champions League last-8 first leg tie at Stamford Bridge, on Wednesday. Thomas Tuchel’s men head to the game after losing 4-1 to Brentford in a Premier League tie over the weekend. Real Madrid, meanwhile, defeated Celta Vigo 2-1 in a LaLiga tie. But Nevin believes Real Madrid will be disappointed after the match at Stamford Bridge. “If Real Madrid thinks they can watch this game back and expect the same result, performance, system and even personnel, especially in the midfield, they’ll be very disappointed. “This will be one of those special nights when I have no doubt it will be a pleasure to be at Stamford Bridge, maybe even a game to be talked about for years and decades to come,” Nevin told Chelsea’s official website.
