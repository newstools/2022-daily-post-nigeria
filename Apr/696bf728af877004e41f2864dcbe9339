Real Madrid goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois, took a dig at arch-rivals Barcelona after they were confirmed LaLiga champions on Saturday. Los Blancos needed only a point against Espanyol, but ran out 4-0 winners. The result saw them open a 17-point gap ahead of their nearest challengers Sevilla, with four fixtures left. Courtois has now pointed at their 4-0 loss to Barca in El Clasico as the key moment in the season. “The key moment came after the Clasico,” Courtois told Movistar+. “Some celebrated as if they had just won the title, that they had come back, but we kept our calm to beat Celta in a tough match and then Getafe, who are always difficult opponents. “La Liga is a team effort. We all attack and defend. That day against Sevilla was crucial, coming back from 2-0 down when everybody thought we were on the floor and that killed our rivals a little.”
