A former Governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, has hit back at the General Overseer of Citadel Global Community Church, formerly known as Latter Rain Assembly, Pastor Tunde Bakare, for saying Igbos cannot rule Nigeria, because they are under a curse. Okorocha, who is now a senator representing Imo West, insisted that Igbos are an asset to the country and that they are not the problem of the country. He stated this on Tuesday at his Unity House Campaign office in Abuja, when he was visited by the National Youth Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr Dayo Israel. In a viral video, Bakare said: “Why should anyone in this country say the Igbo man cannot be president of Nigeria? I was at Imo State and I told them the reason why the Igbo cannot rule Nigeria and I want to remove the curse today.” However, Okorocha reacting to those comments, said: “When I listened to Bakare mention that the Igbos are cursed in the cause of his preaching, I think that is an overstatement and unwarranted preaching. “I must state here categorically that Igbos are not cursed and they will never be cursed.” Okorocha admitted that although Igbos may not be good politicians, they “are a great asset to this country. They are not the problem”.
