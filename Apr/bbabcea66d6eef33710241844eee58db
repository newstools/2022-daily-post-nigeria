One of the gubernatorial aspirants on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo State, Engineer Joseph Tegbe has dumped the party. DAILY POST gathered that Tegbe, until his defection, was one of the aspirants jostling to contest the gubernatorial election on the platform of APC in 2023. Tegbe was one of the gubernatorial aspirants who were asked to step down for Mr. Adebayo Adelabu during the 2019 general elections. He has now joined the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the State. Tegbe said that he left APC for PDP after deliberation with his supporters. In a statement obtained by DAILY POST Friday morning, he added that he had resigned his membership of APC and since then, he has joined the ruling PDP. He maintained that he agreed to step down as a team player during the APC primary in 2019 but that the recent developments in Oyo APC had become worrisome. He alleged that a minority group had hijacked APC in the State. He said, “Though I was a frontrunner in the 2018 campaign, I agreed to step down as a team player and continued to make my contribution to the party. “Unfortunately, the recent developments in the Oyo APC has become worrisome. We watched a minority hijack the party structure, backed by some powers at the top. “We saw congress results, democratically agreed at Ward and LG level being altered to favour this minority group. Efforts to make the National Leadership of the party see reasons have yielded no fruits. A house divided against itself cannot stand. “After careful consideration and deliberation with my support groups, I have resigned my membership in APC and I am now a member of the Peoples Democratic Party. “This decision is in line with my commitment to serve our people, and contribute my quota to the development of our dear State, with those who appreciate the power of a team. I thank the leadership of the PDP for welcoming us”.
