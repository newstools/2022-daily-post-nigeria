Imo West Senator, Rochas Okorocha has urged the All Progressives Congress, APC, to zone its presidential ticket to the South-East. Okorocha explained that APC should zone its presidential ticket to the South-East for the sake of equity, justice and fairness. The former Imo State Governor said lack of zoning the presidency may hurt the nation “from time to time.” He noted that the Presidency can only be thrown open after all zones have produced a President. “APC presidential ticket should go South for equity, justice and fairness and to give everyone a sense of belonging. “Secondly, even in the South, there is a need for micro-zoning like it was done in the days of Olu Falae and President Olusegun Obasanjo. They should look at the South-east and micro-zone it to the South-east to complete this long-awaited cycle for justice and peace. “Maybe after four years or after eight years, you might now say okay the cycle is completed. Now, it is an open game for all. But as long as that cycle is not completed, it might be hurting the nation from time to time because something is wrong,” he told ThisDay. Some political stakeholders have been calling for the zoning of the Presidency to the South-East.
