Abductors of Apostle John Okoriko, the general overseer of Solid Rock Kingdom Church, Mkpat Enin Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State have reduced their ransom demand to N30m. DAILY POST reported that Okoriko was abducted inside his house on Tuesday evening and his abductors contacted his family the following day, demanding for N100million ransom. It was gathered from a family source that when the family could not raise the requested amount, the kidnappers reduced it to N30million. According to the source, who pleaded anonymity, “this morning again, the man of God called us and asked that his abductors are now looking for N30m, we don’t have such money, we are still begging them.” However, some stakeholders in the church have requested members to stop all social media postings to help security agencies in intelligence gathering on the abduction of the man of God. Meanwhile, the Akwa Ibom State Police Public Relations Officer, Odiko Mcdon has already assured the public that the Commissioner of Police, Andrew Ammieghene had ordered investigation into the incident.
