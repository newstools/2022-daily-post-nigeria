Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, has given reasons he won’t resign yet to contest the 2023 presidential race. Ngige, who had declared to run for presidency in 2023, disclosed that he has not received any specific instruction from the All Progressives Congress (APC) on his presidential ambition. Speaking to newsmen after the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting on Wednesday, Ngige denied knowledge of the APC directives that all appointees should resign ahead of the May 30 presidential primary. He maintained that his decision to remain a member of the Federal Executive Council is in line with the 1999 Constitution, as amended. The Minister further stated that the March 18 judgement of the Federal High Court in Umuahia, struck out Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, adding that he is under no compulsion to resign his appointment. When asked when he will resign in line with his party directives, he said: “Because I don’t know about that I’m hearing for the first time from you. But like I always say, I’ll be guided by the letters and spirit of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”
