A commercial driver, Samaila Hamisu Garba, has been convicted and sentenced to six months in a correctional facility by a Bauchi State Traffic Mobile/Magistrate Court for assaulting a Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) personnel in the state. The convict was, however, given the option of a N40,000 fine. Garba, who was charged with dangerous driving and assault on the Corps personnel on official duty, was arraigned and summarily convicted in charge number FRSCBH/01/22, FRSC vs Samaila Hamisu Garba as revealed by the Zonal Legal Officer of the FRSC. The court directed the convict to pay N20,000 compensation to the FRSC operative assaulted and for the injury, he sustained in the course of the assault. Garba was further ordered to fix the damaged windscreen of his OPEL Salon car, with registration BSA 247 AS, at his own cost. Reacting to the judgment, Bauchi State FRSC Sector Commander, Yusuf Abdullahi, commended the court for the prompt judgment, which he noted would serve as a deterrent to others who may be nursing such acts. Abdullahi, however, warned the Corps personnel against engaging any traffic offender in fisticuffs, saying that if such an offender gets away today, he will definitely be apprehended tomorrow. While emphasising that their reason for being on the road is to ensure the safety of all road users, the Sector Commander urged drivers to see FRSC personnel as partners in the safety of lives and properties. He urged motorists to relate with Road Safety officials as friends and brothers working together for the good of all.
