One of the founding members of the Peoples Democratic Party in Akwa Ibom State, Inibehe Okorie has returned to the party after sojourning several years in the opposition All Progressive Congress, APC He cited persistent disunity, and acrimony in the APC as part of the reasons for returning to the PDP. Okorie while addressing the leadership of the state chapter of the PDP led by Chairman, Mr. Aniekan Akpan, described his move to the opposition APC in the state, as “a wrong step in the wrong direction”. Okorie, a founding member of the PDP in 1998, regretted the move, explaining that his return was borne out of the fact that “the APC in the state has become a confused assembly with factional leaders crippling the progress of the party in the state”. Commending the unity and cohesion within the PDP family, Okorie noted that such values would place the party on a good pedestal to win the upcoming polls across all positions in the state. He said he was not returning to seek any political position but to add value with his wealth of knowledge and experience to bear in further strengthening the party ahead of the 2023 elections. Besides, Okorie commended Governor Udom Emmanuel for uniting the party and building effective structures from the wards and chapters to the state level and pledged to join hands in the rebuilding process. The Chairman of the party in the state, Aniekan Akpan, expressed delight at the return of Okorie, saying “the PDP is the only party with one house in Akwa Ibom”, adding, “We already have two APC offices in the state, who knows before the weekend, there won’t be another one?”. He, therefore, urged Okorie to be part of the success story in sustaining the winning ways of the PDP he co-founded, as the 2023 general elections draw closer.
