Singer, Timi Dakolo has opined that the saying that ‘money is the root of all evil’ is one of the biggest lies told by pastors over the years. Dakolo made this known in a tweet on his Twitter page. He said people now see the drive to chase money as evil because of pastors. “One of the biggest lies we were taught was that ‘money is the root of all evil’. And people we looked up to as the mouth piece of God screamed it repeatedly until it stuck in people’s mind. “They saw the drive to want and chase money as evil. So many people settled.”
