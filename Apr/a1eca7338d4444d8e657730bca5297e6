A 30-year-old man, Ajibola Akindele, has been accused of raping a girl inside a church at the Ita-Oshin area of Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. DAILY POST reports that Akindele was arrested on Monday, following a complaint lodged at the Lafenwa divisional police headquarters, Abeokuta, by the mother of the victim. The mother had told the police that she sent her daughter, alongside the suspect, to go and decorate the said church on April 16. Ogun police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, on Thursday, quoted the woman as saying that her daughter and Akindele met some other women sweeping the church in preparation for the Easter Sunday service. “But soon as those women left after sweeping the church, the suspect took advantage of being alone with the victim and forcefully had unlawful carnal knowledge of her right inside the church,” Oyeyemi said. Upon the report, the DPO of Lafenwa division, CSP Kayode Shadrach, was said to have detailed his detectives to go after the suspect, with a view to bringing him to justice. According to him, police detectives quickly moved to the scene and promptly arrested the suspect, who Oyeyemi reported having confessed to the commission of the crime. It was gathered that the Commissioner of Police in Ogun, Lanre Bankole, has ordered the transfer of the suspect to the anti-human trafficking and child labour unit of the state CIID for further investigation and prosecution.
