The Osun State Government has ordered an immediate investigation into the remote and immediate causes of the violent face-off between the personnel of the Nigerian Police and youths of Okoro, Ile-Ife. In a statement signed by Funke Egbemode, the state’s Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, the state government announced that it was aware of the violence. Appealing to the youths and residents to give peace a chance, the government noted that the violence was sparked off by the confrontation between the police and youths in the area. “The government has ordered an immediate investigation into the remote and immediate causes of the violence, especially the alleged death of a detained suspect and shooting by men of the Nigerian Police at unarmed youths. “In the meantime, residents of the area are urged not to take laws into their hands by hurting more people or destroying properties. “We implore our citizens to embrace peace and shun violence, in the spirit of this solemn season,” the statement concluded.
