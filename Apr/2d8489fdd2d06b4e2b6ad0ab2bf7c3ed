Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has pardoned a civil servant in the State, who was suspended for spreading death rumour about the Governor. Akeredolu directed the Head of Service, HoS, Pastor Niran Adeyemo to recall the suspended civil servant back to service. The HoS had last week disclosed the suspension of the civil servant who was accused of spreading the false information on his Facebook page. While breaking the Ramadan fast, Iftar, with the muslim faithful in Akure, the State capital, the Governor said “father forgive them for they know not what they were doing”. The Governor, who was making his first public appearance in the State after his vacation, frowned at the high rate fake news. He also challenged journalists to always cross-check and confirm stories. Akeredolu added that civil servants should channel their energy into more meaningful conversation of sharing good news in the State, rather than spreading fake news.
