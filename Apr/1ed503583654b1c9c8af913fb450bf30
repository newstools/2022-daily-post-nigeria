Popular Television personality and life-long fan of Arsenal, Piers Morgan has hit out at Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta following their 2-1 defeat to Brighton in a Premier League tie on Saturday. Brighton defeated Arsenal at Emirates Stadium following goals from Leandro Trossard and Enock Mwepu. Martin Odegaard did score a late goal for the North London club. The outcome against Brighton means Arsenal is in the fifth position on the Premier League table with 54 points from 30 games. Reacting, Morgan said Arteta gave Aubameyang free to Barcelona while keeping Alexandre Lacazette, who he claimed has not scored a goal in open play since last December. According to him, it was the worst decision the Spaniard had made at the Gunners. He tweeted: “Reminder that Arteta gave away Aubameyang for FREE to Barcelona where he is banging in goals for fun – and kept Lacazette who hasn’t scored in open play since December. “Looks a worse and worse decision with every game that passes. Yet, Arsenal fans support it.”
