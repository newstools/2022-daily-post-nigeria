Bring Back Our Girls (BBOG) co-founder, Aisha Oyebode-Muhammed has saluted the parents of abducted Chibok girls for their courage and resilience. The Presidency and Government of Nigeria were silent on the 8th year anniversary today April 14, 2022. Oyebode-Muhammed charged the parents and Nigerians to use their votes wisely in the 2023 general elections. On April 14, 2014, Boko Haram invaded the Government Girls Secondary School in Chibok, Borno State. More than 270 young girls were kidnapped and though some have regained freedom or escaped, others remain in captivity. In a letter to the parents, Oyebode-Muhammed lamented that despite all efforts, all the girls are not back safely. “Eight years today, about 100 of the girls are yet to get freedom with no further clue from appropriate quarters on the development. “It is from this background that I want to urge all to use your votes wisely in the next elections”, the activist noted. “I remain saddened that despite all our collective actions, and that of the many other families affected by his brutal insurgency, your daughters remain absent.” The daughter of former Head of State, Murtala Muhammed said the 2023 polls should be used “to make the search and rescue of your daughters”. More than 100 Chibok girls are still being held by the Boko Haram sect responsible for over a decade of murder and destruction. The terror of the group has caused the death of thousands of people and displaced millions in (mostly) Nigeria and neighbouring countries.
