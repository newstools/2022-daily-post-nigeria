The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in Yobe State, has extended the service year of two corps members, for violating laws of the scheme. Mrs. Hafsat Yerima, Yobe State Coordinator NYSC, disclosed this on Thursday at the passing out parade of the 2021 Batch ‘A’ stream II Corps Members held at August 27 Stadium, Damaturu. “As a corollary for failure to abide by the law of National Service, two corps members have their service year extended for a period from one to two months for acts of impropriety which constitutes an infraction of the NYSC Bye-laws”, she stated. The Coordinator said NYSC like other institutions in the country has its carrot and stick policy where there are rewards for hard-work as well as punishments for indolence and indiscipline. “It is my earnest and sincere hope that you have learnt the lesson intended by this carrot and stick policy of the scheme”, she said. Mrs. Yerima, however, charged the passing out corps members to exploit their entrepreneurship skills learnt during the orientation course to be self-employed. “There is no better time to start as masters of yourselves than now because you have neither high expectations of yourself nor encumbrances. Fortunately, governments at all levels are making devout efforts at creating an investment-friendly environment for the creative minds”. In this regard, the Coordinator maintained that, the Management of the NYSC is collaborating with financial institutions and donor agencies with the aim of empowering skilful Corps Members to start businesses of their own after service. “Happily, some corps members have benefitted from the collaboration”. She lauded the Yobe State Government for all the necessary support and cooperation given to the Scheme. “We count immensely on the usual support and cooperation of the state government for creating the enabling environment for the success of the programme,” she added.
