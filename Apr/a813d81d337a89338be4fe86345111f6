A member of the House of Representatives from Plateau State, Hon. Yusuf Gagdi (APC) has called on the National Assembly to enact laws that will permit citizens of the country to bear arms to defend themselves. He said legalising the bearing of arms bearing would go a long way in addressing the spate of attacks and killings in communities. Gagdi made the call while speaking with journalists on Friday, shortly after he visited some communities in Kanam and Wase Local Government Areas recently attacked by bandits. DAILY POST recalls that gunmen suspected to be bandits had last Sunday stormed some communities in Kanam and Wase LGA; killed over 100 people, injured scores and razed many houses. Gagdi who is representing Pankshin/Kanke/Kanam Federal constituency said, stiffer measures must be put in place to regulate the use of arms by the citizens ”If we want to curtail the spate of attacks in communities, we should make laws that will permit citizens to carry arms. ”If for instance, those who attacked my people know that the locals also have arms, they won’t come, and even they do, the casualty will not be this high. “But there must be regulation on the use of the arms; anyone who misuses it should be imprisoned or even sentenced to death by hanging. ”But I tell you, if citizens are allowed to carry arms to protect themselves, all these attacks and killings will end,” he said. Gagdi called on security agencies to always work on intelligence reports at their disposals to avert incidents that could lead to security breaches. He maintained that the attacks in his constituency could have been avoided if the security agencies acted on the intelligence report at their disposal The lawmaker, however, lauded the military for the prompt response and deployment of personnel to the affected communities.
