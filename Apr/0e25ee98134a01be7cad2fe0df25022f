Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi has finally declared his ambition to become Nigeria’s President in 2023. Amaechi made the declaration at an ongoing All Progressives Congress (APC) event in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. The former Rivers Governor said he would seek the party’s ticket to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. “I stand before you today to declare my intention and submit my application to serve as your next President”, he announced. In attendance are top APC chieftains, including ex- national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, Senator Gbemi Saraki, Senator Ali Ndume, Victor Giadom, Salihu Mustapha. A fortnight ago, DAILY POST reported that the security around the minister had been heightened. Impecabble sources linked the development to the 2023 presidential race, insisting Buhari is favourably disposed to seeing Amaechi lead the country. The two-time Rivers House of Assembly Speaker now has extra protective agents and a newly-acquired bulletproof Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV). In January, Buhari refused to disclose his preference as successor, expressing fear that the person might be eliminated. In February, Amaechi was turbaned as Dan Amanar Daura (trusted son of Daura) for his contributions to local and national development. The President, who appointed Amaechi as his Campaign Director in the 2015 and 2019 elections, is a native of Daura in Katsina State.
