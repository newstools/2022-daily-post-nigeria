Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has confirmed Antonio Rudiger will leave the club in the summer. Rudiger, who is approaching the end of his contract, has been linked with Real Madrid and Manchester United. Speaking to Sky Sports after Chelsea’s 1-0 win over West Ham on Sunday, Tuchel confirmed: “The situation is that he wants to leave the club. He informed me of this in a private talk. “We gave everything, but we could not fight anymore because of the actions. “We don’t take it personally. It is his decision. “He is a key figure and will stay that way until the end of the season. But it is disappointing. We will miss him a lot. He gives courage in the dressing room. The kind everyone is afraid of, but the kind to play 50-55 games at an outstanding level. He is a top defender in the last one-and-a-half years for me. We then need to find another solution.”
