Barring any last minute change, there are indications that the National Working Committee (NWC) of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has resolved to replace some of the directors who are on compulsory and immediate leave. The six directorates are: Administration, Finance, Research and Statistics, Organisation, Publicity, Welfare and the Head of Legal Services. DAILY POST recalls that the National Chairman of the party, Senator Abdulahi Adamu had set up a Transition Committee after he assumed the leadership of the party to know the state of finances of the party. The committee was also set up to study the handover note by the defunct Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and other sundry matters affecting the National Secretariat of the party. “We want to know where the party is exactly so that we don’t get taken by the exuberance of winning an election and just plunge into the pond pool or not know how deep or the temperature of the water. As for you, the director of admin, you have no hiding place. We will count on your loyalty to the party,” Adamu had hinted. But, a source who does not want his name in print, confided in this paper that the NWC will soon invite applications from qualified persons from within and outside the party to replace the directors. The source stated: “The party is to place an external and internal advertisement to call for applications from suitable and qualified persons to fill the directorate positions in the party. “The NWC has resolved to replace those indicated by the report of the Transition Committee. To this end, the committee resolved to throw the position open to members of the public, as well as encourage qualified officers within the party to also apply. That is why they are placing an internal and external advertisement.”
