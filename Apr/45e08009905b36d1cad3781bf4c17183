An Abuja Federal High Court on Friday ruled on the terrorism charges against Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB. Justice Binta Nyako struck out eight of the 15 counts against Kanu. The judge struck out the eight charges while ruling on a preliminary objection Kanu raised against all the charges. “I have read the counts and counts 6,7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 14 have not disclosed any offence against the defendant. “‘Counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 15 show some allegations. The court shall proceed to try the defendant on those count,” Justice Nyako said. The Nigerian government had filed the 15-count charges bordering on terrorism and treasonable felony against the IPOB leader. The charges which bordered on terrorism were filed against Kanu by the Federal Government. The IPOB leader has been in the custody of the Department of State Services, DSS, since his arrest in June 2021. Kanu was arrested in Kenya and repatriated to Nigeria to continue his trial before Justice Nyako. He was arrested and arraigned for agitating for the actualization of Biafra. However, the IPOB leader contested the charges in a fundamental human rights suit against the Federal Government.
