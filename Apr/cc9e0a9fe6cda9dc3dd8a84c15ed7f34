Tottenham manager, Antonio Conte has opened up on the speculation he wants to dump the London side for Paris Saint-Germain. The Italian, while addressing the press on Friday, dismissed the reports calling the speculation ‘fake news’ and ‘lies’. The former Chelsea boss, who dumped Inter Milan after winning the league title with the Italian giants, joined Totteridge in November but has already been linked with a move. PGG boss, Mauricio Pochettino is said to be set to leave the French capital in the coming weeks and has even been linked with a return to Tottenham. “Obviously, I think that it’s good that other clubs appreciate my work. This is one thing,” Conte said at his pre-match press conference on Friday. “But the truth is that I don’t like when people try to invent news, only to speak, only to create problems. This is not right, not fair for me, for the clubs involved and for my players. “Also because we’re really focussed on these five games to get a fantastic result for us. I repeat, this type of situation makes me smile. “But I think that also the people that want to tell something about this have to show respect for all the people involved in this situation, and not invent fake news and tell a lot of lies.”
