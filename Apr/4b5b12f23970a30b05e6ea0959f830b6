Former Senator representing Kaduna Central, Shehu Sani, has said if he becomes the Governor of Kaduna State, he will recall the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) soldiers who fought in Liberia and Sierra Leone wars to lead the battle against terrorists in the state. Senator Sani stated this in a post via his Facebook page on Saturday, while also pledging to organize and train communities and villages in Northern and Southern Kaduna to defend their ancestral lands. He also posted that the community volunteers would work under the Kaduna People’s Revolutionary Action Against Terrorism (KAPRAAT). “As the Governor of Kaduna State I will recall the ECOMOG soldiers who fought in Liberia and Sierra Leone wars to lead the battle; and I shall organize and train communities and villages in Northern and Southern Kaduna to defend their ancestral land and take on the terrorists by establishing the Kaduna People’s Revolutionary Action Against Terrorism KAPRAAT,” he posted.
