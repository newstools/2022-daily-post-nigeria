The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, is currently in a meeting with Governors elected on the platform of the party. At least 16 Governors are present at Tinubu’s Abuja residence, where he will formally inform them about his presidential ambition. The rest are expected to join via Zoom.  This comes few hours after vice president, Yemi Osinbajo, joined him in the race to become Nigeria’s next president in 2023. Osinbajo himself met with APC Governors on Sunday after the Iftar dinner. It was after the meeting that Osinbajo declared his ambition to succeed his principal, Muhammadu Buhari.
