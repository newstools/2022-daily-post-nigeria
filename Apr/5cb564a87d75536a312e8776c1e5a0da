The Director-General, National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Brig.-Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim, has urged corpS members to avoid embarking on night journeys to reduce the risk of getting involved in auto crashes. He added that corps members should shun social vices such as drug abuse, trafficking, cybercrime and advanced-fee-fraud in their Places of Primary Assignment, PPA. Ibrahim, who was represented by the Akwa Ibom Coordinator, Mrs Chinyere Ekwe, gave the charge during the closing ceremony of 2022 Batch “A” Stream 2 Corps Members at NYSC Orientation camp, Ikot Itie Udung in Nsit Atai on Thursday. The DG told corps members that when their journey exceeds 6pm they should spend their night at military barracks or any other officially secured location. He further told them to always board vehicles at officially registered parks to avoid falling prey in the hands of criminals and ritualists. According to him, “to greatly minimize the risk of road traffic accidents, you are expected to always cut short your trips from 6pm in the evening and pass the night at military barracks and other locations officially designated as safe.” He, however, commended the Federal Government for providing the opportunity for the take -off of Corps members enrolment in the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). He said the initiative known as NYSC Group Individual Family Social Health Insurance Programme (GIFSHIP) would help in improving the health of corps members even as he enjoined them to make good use of the opportunity by registering under the Health Care Providers in their service locations.
