Governor Chukwuma Soludo has revealed that the arsonists who destroyed Ekwulobia, the headquarters of Aguata Local Government Area of the state, are not from Anambra State. DAILY POST recalls that the LG secretariat including shops and vehicles parked in the area were on Thursday razed by gunmen. Governor Soludo reveals that the attack was carried out by fleeing criminals who were chased from their operational camp and hideout by Nigerian security forces. According to him, military operations at the borders of Aguluezechukwu and Ogborji communities in the Local Government had led to the dislodging of the criminal elements who he said had been operating in the areas for over two years. The governor, who revealed that the arsonists are from other states in the Southeast, lamented why some Igbos chose to harm themselves. He said ”They were smoked out, the camp destroyed and as they were fleeing cowardly, they decided to set the Local Government Secretariat ablaze but thank God the police came on time and smoked them out. “From the statistics so far, 85 per cent of people arrested come from one of the states in the South East and the remaining 15 per cent from another state in the Southeast. ”It is really our people doing this to themselves.”
