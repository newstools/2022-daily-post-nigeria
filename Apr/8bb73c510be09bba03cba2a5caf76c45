Manchester United legend, Denis Irwin has described Erik ten Hag’s appointment as Manchester United manager as exciting. Erik ten Hag was confirmed as the new Manchester United manager on Thursday and will take over at Old Trafford at the end of the season and Irwin says the fans will give him their full support. The Ajax boss is expected to, with a lot of ideas, turn things around at Old Trafford with the club really struggling to make an impact in recent weeks. The Red Devils were defeated 9-0 in both legs of their Premier League clashes with rivals Liverpool this season. Their struggles continue despite sacking Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and the appointment of Ralf Rangnick with the 20-time league champions battling to qualify for the Champions League next term. “I’m more than happy, he’s an exciting appointment,” the Irishman said to Sky Sports. “The style of football that he’s played at Ajax over the last four-and-a-half years is great to watch. “Huge success in Holland alone, but also on the European stage, we mentioned the 2018/19 European campaign [where Ajax beat Real Madrid and Juventus and reached the semi-finals of the Champions League]. “But even this year, winning the six games in the group stage, [and they were] a bit unlucky to go out to Benfica, so an exciting appointment and I think all the fans are right behind it.”
