Niger State Governor and Chairman North Central Governors Forum, Abubakar Sani Bello, has called on Christians in the state and beyond to sustain prayers for lasting peace in the nation as they celebrate Easter. Bello in a message noted that Easter is a significant celebration observed by Christians which portrays the sacrifice and love exemplified by Jesus Christ, who is the foundation and the end of the Christian faith. He stressed the need for Christians to celebrate Easter solemnly while reflecting and imbibing the virtues of love, selflessness, forgiveness, perseverance, as well as sacrifice, which are the hallmarks of the celebration. The Governor also urged Christians to use the period to sustain their supplications to God for an end to insecurity in some parts of the state. Bello said, ” as you celebrate, it is important that you imbibe the virtues of Jesus Christ, who is the reason for the celebration, remembrance of his death and resurrection for the salvation of mankind”. “While you celebrate, pray that God will bring an end to all the security challenges confronting the state. We must rise to the fact that these are trying moments for us as alumnus state and we need to strengthen our resolve to collectively confront the challenges”. The Governor wished the Christian faithful a successful and hitch-free celebration while urging them to be security-conscious and report any suspicious movement to the appropriate authorities.
