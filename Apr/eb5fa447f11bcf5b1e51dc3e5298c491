Chelsea defender, Antonio Rudiger’s possible new club has been revealed. According to football transfer expert, Fabrizio Romano,
Real Madrid are now the closest club to find an agreement to sign Rudiger from Chelsea. Romano disclosed this in a tweet via his Twitter handle on Saturday morning. He tweeted: “Toni Rüdiger has not signed with any club yet. Real Madrid are now the closest to find an agreement, talks ongoing for months. Real Madrid are on it since December. “PSG, interested. Man United and Bayern, out of the race… and Chelsea’s situation still [has] not changed.” Rudiger’s current contract with Chelsea will expire at the end of the season. Chelsea’s talks over an extension for Rudiger have been hampered by the sanctions placed by the UK Government.
