Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has revealed that he did not speak a lot with Jorginho after Italy’s failure to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar because he didn’t know what to say to the midfielder that would take his pain away. Jorginho was unable to save Italy as his country suffered a heartbreaking 1-0 defeat against North Macedonia a few days ago in a World Cup playoff. Italy will miss out on the FIFA World Cup for the second time in a row. Speaking ahead of Chelsea’s clash with Brentford this weekend, Tuchel said at his pre-match press conference: “To be very honest, I did not speak a lot with him [Jorginho] about that because what could I say to make his pain go away? Nothing. “I think, like always, it’s our job to create an environment and atmosphere where the players feel welcome and safe, no matter what happens outside. “He was very, very strong in training, I have to say. A very good response. He came in one day earlier than he needed to be. “That’s why I had the feeling he loved to be back and be in this environment because it’s a positive environment.”
