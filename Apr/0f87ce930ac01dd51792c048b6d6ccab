Former Liverpool defender, Jose Enrique, has urged forward Divock Origi not to join another Premier League club from the Reds to avoid tarnishing his legacy at Anfield. Enrique also claimed that Origi deserves a statue at Liverpool for what he has done for the Merseyside club over the years. Origi looks destined to leave Liverpool this summer with his contract set to expire. The Belgium star has been linked with a host of clubs across Europe. And Enrique wants the 27-year-old to instead make a move to clubs like AC Milan and Inter Milan. “Origi is good enough to stay in the Premier League and he is playing for one of the best teams in the world,” Enrique Lord Ping, as quoted by Express Sport. “He’s not starting and he has not been playing too much this season, so a team like AC Milan and Inter Milan looks like where he could be heading. I can’t see him playing anywhere in the Premier League, but I think he is good enough.” He added: “I think if I was him and you have teams like AC Milan, Inter Milan and top teams like that interested, I would rather go and play in a team where he’s a ‘hero’ as Liverpool call him the legend himself because he always comes when the team needs him. Also, they are in Europe and a footballer’s career is short, so maybe that’s the best thing to do. “He could go to Newcastle because they have a lot of money to spend and they will want to bring new players, but I would not go to one of Liverpool’s rivals because I think his legacy at Liverpool is amazing, they should make a statue of him for what he’s done and what he’s won.”
