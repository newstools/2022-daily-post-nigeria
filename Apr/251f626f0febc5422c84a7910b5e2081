A middle-aged man caused a stir at the University of Medical Science Teaching Hospital, UNIMED, complex in Akure, Ondo State capital, after he allegedly slapped three health officers over high medical bill. The man, whose identity could not be ascertained as at press time, was said to have gone haywire after nurses on duty gave him his aged mother’s hospital bill. It was gathered that the man, out of anger, rained slaps on the health officers, over their failure to give explanation for the huge bill. As a result, four hospital security guards allegedly gave him the beating of his life before dragging him out of the female ward and took him to the Accident and Emergency ward. According to some health authorities who spoke with DAILY POST about the matter, the man grew hostile after receiving the bill for his mother’s treatment. The matter allegedly escalated into a heated argument, prompting the man to hit the health officers. Meanwhile, in the process of dragging the man out of the ward to an open space in front of the A & E ward, he sustained some minor injuries on his right wrist, while his left eye was also swollen.
