Justice Taiwo Oladipupo Taiwo of the Federal High Court in Abuja has put the judgment on the defection of Cross River State governor, Ben Ayade from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to All Progressives Congress (APC) on hold. The judge put the judgment on hold following a letter by Mike Ozekhome SAN, counsel to the governor, who claimed to be drawing the attention of the court to a judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered in Enugu. Although, the judgment was slated for this morning for delivery, the judge ordered counsel in the suit to address him on the implications of the appellate court’s judgment on the present case. At the time of this report, Emmanuel Ukala for PDP, which instituted the case against Ayade, was addressing the court. Justice Taiwo also ordered Ozekhome SAN to make a case for Ayade while lawyer to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) will follow. Meanwhile, legal fireworks have been ignited by lawyers in the defection suit. It could not be ascertained if the judge will proceed to deliver the judgment after being addressed by the lawyers.
