Former Manchester United midfielder, Owen Hargreaves has made his Premier League top-four prediction. This was after Tottenham and Arsenal were both defeated in the Premier League on Saturday. Arsenal were defeated by Southampton while Tottenham were beaten 1-0 by Brighton in front of their home fans to give Manchester United real hope of qualifying for the Champions League. Mikel Arteta’s side emerged as the favourites to grab the position after impressive performances but they have lost their last three games without scoring. The Gunners are now sitting on sixth, three points behind fourth-placed Spurs with a game in hand. With bad results hitting Arsenal, it was an opportunity for Tottenham to climb six points clear of their top-four rivals. But they were beaten 1-0 by Brighton in Saturday’s early fixture while Manchester United beat Norwich City 3-2 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo’s hat-trick. Manchester United, Arsenal and Tottenham are now separated by just three points. Hargreaves predicted Tottenham to clinch the final Champions League spot. “Fixture-wise, it’s tough for Arsenal,” he said on Premier League Productions. “They struggled against Crystal Palace, Brighton and Southampton. “They’ve got Chelsea, Man United, West Ham, Leeds and Tottenham coming up. Looking at Arsenal’s fixtures I’m saying no. “I know they’re close but if you’re losing and not scoring against Palace, Brighton and Southampton, you’re going to struggle. It’s made it really difficult for them. “Tottenham are still in the driving seat because they’re ahead. Arsenal have that game in hand but I think Arsenal will fall short with the fixtures they’ve got. “Manchester United are just too inconsistent. Tottenham should be able to get the job done.”
