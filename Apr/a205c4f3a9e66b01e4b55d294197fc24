The UK Defence Ministry has revealed three major factors obstructing Russia from progressing in their ongoing war with Ukraine. It said that Russia’s ability to progress in the war with Ukraine has continued to be wedged by the environmental, logistical and technical challenges that have beset them so far. The UK Defence Ministry disclosed this in a tweet via its Twitter handle on Tuesday while providing the latest update on the situation in Ukraine. The Ministry tweeted: “Russian shelling and strikes on the Donbas line of control continue to increase, with the Ukrainians repelling numerous attempted advances by Russian forces. “Russia’s ability to progress continues to be impacted by the environmental, logistical and technical challenges that have beset them so far, combined with the resilience of the highly-motivated Ukrainian armed forces. “Russia’s inability to stamp out resistance in Mariupol and their indiscriminate attacks, which have harmed the resident civilian populace, are indicative of their continued failure to achieve their aims as quickly as they would like.” The war between Russia and Ukraine began in February this year and many casualties have already been recorded as a result of the conflict between both neighbouring countries.
