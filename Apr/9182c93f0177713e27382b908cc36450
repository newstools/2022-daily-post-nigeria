Nigerian police officers who were dismissed for allegedly masterminding the planned strike by some junior officers over poor salary and welfare stormed Human Right Radio’s Berekete Family Show popularly known as ’embelembe’ in Abuja for justice on Wednesday. Recall that the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, had ordered the dismissal of nine police officers for allegedly spearheading the planned strike. The affected officers, who include two Inspectors, five Sergeants and two Constables approached the radio station on Wednesday morning during the live program with the hope of getting justice. Speaking, the host of Berekete Family Show, Ahmed Isah, popularly known as Ordinary President, vowed that the officers would get justice, saying the dismissal was unjust. A DAILY POST correspondent who monitored the program reported that the Ordinary President pledged to take necessary steps including legal actions to get justice for the officers. He said, “We have lawyers to follow the case till you get justice. Even if this case persists for one million years, we will ensure that you get justice. “We have always been speaking on behalf of the Nigerian police? The Nigerian police have suffered enough. How can they dismiss you when you are expected to be engaged in the solution?” He lamented the level of hardship meted against the police by the Federal Government despite their sufferings in securing the nation. He asked them to return to the studio in two weeks’ time.
