A nursing mother who was arrested alongside some criminal suspects has claimed to be responsible for keeping the gang’s arsenal. Laptops, cash, locally produced guns, and other deadly weapons were among the items recovered from the suspects. The suspects were paraded at the DSS headquarters in Akure, the capital of Ondo State, where the state’s Director of DSS, Mr Jonathan Kure, said the syndicate terrorizing the state specialized in kidnapping toddlers. Kure further said the gang’s sixth member had been taken to the hospital due to a gunshot wound. According to the DSS Director, intelligence reports confirmed that the suspects were the only syndicate that specialized in kidnapping toddlers. Kure, who said the investigation would continue and that they will be charged to court soon, revealed that the operation was carried out in collaboration with the Nigerian Army.
