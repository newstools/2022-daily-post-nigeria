The Lagos State Government has insisted it only approved May 2nd and 3rd as public holidays for this year’s International Workers’ Day and the Eid-el-Fitr celebrations. The government also informed workers to ignore its earlier circular which approved three days as public holidays. The Head of Service in Lagos State, Hakeem Muri-Okunola, in a circular to workers dated April 27, 2022, had approved May 2-4 as public holidays. However, upon the declaration by the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, that May 2-3 were approved, Muri-Okunola made a U-Turn and approved the same, urging workers to disregard the first circular. In the second circular titled, ‘Re: Year 2022 Workers’ Day Celebration/Id-El-Fitr Public Holidays’, the Lagos HoS said, “Public servants in the state are therefore to disregard the resumption date stated in CIRCULAR NO 018 of 27th of April, 2022 and note that work resumes on Wednesday, 4th of May, 2022 at 08:00 am prompt.”
