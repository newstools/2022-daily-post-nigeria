The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Osun State Command has deployed 1,200 personnel to provide security across the state during and after the Easter celebrations. The state Commandant, Emmanuel Ocheja who spoke through the Command’s Public Relations Officer, Assistant Superintendent of Corps II, Olabisi Atanda said the Command has put in place robust security arrangements and crime prevention strategies to ensure crime-free Easter festivities in the state. While assuring adequate security of lives and property throughout the celebration, the NSCDC boss said his operatives are already emplaced on the major roads across the state, stressing that patrol teams and surveillance squads will provide security in public places and recreation. The personnel, according to the command, will display a high level of professionalism while discharging their duties while appealing to members of the public to be moderate in their celebration. Ocheja then called on members of the public to be security-conscious and provide useful information to the NSCDC about unusual activities noticed in their area. He further called on unscrupulous elements in the state to have a change of mind as the command will arrest and prosecute whoever is bent on frustrating the peace of the state. Ocheja felicitated with Christians and, however, charged them to imbibe the ”lessons of the crucifixion and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, pray for the nation”, Osun State.
