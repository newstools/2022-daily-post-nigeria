The All Progressives Congress (APC) says it will not let things pass unchecked and will do everything to protect votes of all its candidates as Adamawa State conducts local government election on Saturday. The party warned the electoral body conducting the election to ensure that all its candidates who may win in the election in any of the 21 LGs of the state are duly declared winners. The APC National Vice Chairman (North East), Comrade Salihu Mustapha, who addressed journalists at the Adamawa State secretariat of the party in Yola on Friday, told any government agency or individual with plan to rig out APC candidates to jettison such plan. “Let’s see a government or an individual that will take our win if we win. We won’t take it. This won’t be business as usual,” the APC vice chairman said. Speaking of a purported rumour that the PDP-government is going to write results and to declare their candidates at will, Salihu Mustapha said it would not be allowed to happen. “I want to encourage our people to come out and vote. I’m assuring our people it is not going to be business as usual, let’s see the person that will take our win,” Salihu said. Speaking on insecurity, Mustapha called on Nigerians to unite, saying the bandits attacks ravaging the country is a gorilla war that takes all Nigerians to work together to fight it.
