All Progressives Congress (APC) members in Orolu and Irepodun Local Government Areas of Osun State have kicked against moves by some members of the party to distort the zoning arrangements for both Senatorial and House of Representatives seats. The APC members, who had gathered at the party Secretariat in Ilobu on Monday, insisted that the House of Representatives ticket of the party should be retained in Irepodun/Orolu, while the Senate ticket remained in Osogbo/Olorunda as it was agreed in 2018. While alleging that some individuals within the party were currently scheming to have the two tickets of the party zoned to Osogbo/Olorunda, they appealed to party leaders and the State governor Adegboyega Oyetola to ensure that there is fairness and equal representation across the area. Baring their minds through a communique issued at the end of their meeting, the members revealed that the conduct of the political affairs in the Federal Constituency had been with mutual respect and on equal partnership amongst the four local government areas that formed the Federal Constituency. Reading the communique issued after the meeting, the Secretary of APC in Osogbo Federal Constituency, Abayomi Oyedeji insisted that for mutual respect and unity of purpose, the zoning formula agreed upon in 2018 should be maintained. He added that maintaining the status quo was a key factor in ensuring victory for the APC in the 2022 Osun gubernatorial and 2023 general elections.
