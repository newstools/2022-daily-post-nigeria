Former Monaco of France gaol King, Victor Ikpeba has predicted the outcome of tonight’s Champions League quarter-final second-leg clash between Chelsea and Real Madrid at the Bernabeu. The former African Footballer of the Year believes the Blues would beat Real Madrid in Spain but tipped the LaLiga leaders to go through to the semifinals. Chelsea was defeated 3-1 by Carlo Ancelotti’s men at Stamford Bridge a week ago and are now in Spain to try to upturn the result in the second leg. “Real Madrid will score two, Benzema will score two, there will be goals in that encounter,” Ikpeba told Super Sports. “I see a 3-2 scoreline in favour of Chelsea but they will not go through.” Ikpeba further advised Belgium International, Romelu Lukaku to leave Stamford Bridge, saying that Chelsea is not for the 28-year-old. “I said Lukaku coming to Chelsea is a blunder. He was playing well for Inter Milan, the whole team built around him, supporting him. “Here at Chelsea too much star players, he’s not going to get the ball every time. The style of play is so difficult, I hope he moves on because I don’t think Chelsea is a club for him.”
