Former Arsenal defender, Gael Clichy has given his verdict on the Gunners’ race to finish fourth in the Premier League this season. The Frenchman believes that his former club are the favourites to grab the final Champions League spot but warned of a possible slip. The former France international said he enjoys the way Arsenal have been playing under Mikel Arteta, adding that he knew the Spanish manager was going to do a great job at the Emirates. “I think he’s been given the time and sufficient financial back-up to do so,” he told talkSPORT. “Are they the favourites for the top-four? Yes – because of the form, the way they play and the exciting talent they have. “But, of course, we know you can win against United, put yourself in a great situation, lose the next game, and then it’s all over again,” he said.
