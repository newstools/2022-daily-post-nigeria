The Federal Government has been criticized over the lingering strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU. Deji Adeyanju, convener of Concerned Nigerians, said it’s unacceptable that the Federal Government can’t properly fund public universities. He lamented that the public university system in Nigeria is built to frustrate students and lecturers. In a chat with DAILY POST on Sunday, the Abuja-based lawyer and rights activist, said the government waste billions on irrelevant things but can’t fund education. Adeyanju further backed the decision of ASUU to remain on strike. According to Adeyanju: “Only those who have a taste of what education should look like will support ASUU strike: I support the ASUU strike 100% because if you observe how properly coordinated and funded private universities are, then you will realize that our public universities are hellholes. “The whole public university system in Nigeria is built to frustrate both students and lecturers. Government can waste billions on irrelevance but can’t fund our universities. This is unacceptable.”
