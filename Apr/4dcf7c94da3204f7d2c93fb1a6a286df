Niger State House of Assembly has confirmed two Commissioner nominees forwarded last week by Governor Abubakar Sani Bello to the house. The nominees include Daniel H. Galadima, a former federal civil servant and Muhammad Usman Tinau, the immediate past Director-General, Niger State Pension Board. During plenary, Yabagi Umar representing the Katcha constituency moved a motion that Galadiman be allowed to take a bow and leave, noting that, since he was accompanied by the State APC Chairman, Zakari Jikantoro for the screening, showed that the nominee has what it takes to improve the economy of the state and the motion was seconded by member representing Agwara constituency, Bello Ahmed. Also, Ahmed Marafa Guni, representing Chanchaga constituency, equally moved a motion that the second nominee, Muhammad Usman Tinau be asked to take a bow and leave and was seconded by Mohammed Bashir Lokogoma, a member representing Wushishi constituency. Hence, when the Speaker, Abdullahi Bawa Wuse put it to the House if it was alright to confirm both nominees as commissioners designate, the lawmakers unanimously accepted. Speaking with newsmen after the screening exercise, the commissioner promised to bring their wealth of experience to bear in the discharge of their duties for the development and progress of the state. According to Galadiman,” though, this government has barely over one year to vacate, the time limit will not stop us from contributing to the development of the state and changing the narrative for good”.
