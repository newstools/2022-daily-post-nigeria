General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, on Sunday, said he has never voted because RCCG is mainly represented in every party. Adeboye, who spoke at the Church’s thanksgiving service in Lagos State, said voting for one will be unjust to the rest of his children. He stressed that everyone has the right to join a political party but his duty was to pray and he will keep doing that. ”My assignment has nothing to do with partisan politics. Politics is not my calling but to be a pastor. ”I have never told you this is the fellow you should vote for or the Party you should vote for. “In RCCG, every party is mainly represented. I’m a father of all and I like it that way. I’m not a politician and I will never be. ”The only reason I have never voted is that if I vote for one I will be unjust to the rest of my children. I am the father of all. “As a Nigerian, you must register, vote, and make sure that your vote counts. You are a Nigerian first before becoming a Christian. Nobody is born a Christian, you are a true Christian when you give your life to Christ. You must vote and make sure there is no rigging. ”You have a duty to belong to any party of your choice at the very grass root. You can’t sit down fold your hands, refuse to vote and begin to complain about the government,” he said.
