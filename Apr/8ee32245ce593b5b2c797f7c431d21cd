The Kebbi State Government has reduced the working hours for the state workers by one hour, due to Ramadan fast. This was disclosed in a statement by the state acting Head of Service, Alhaji Safiyanu Garba-Bena, on Wednesday. He declared that workers are expected to begin work from 8 am to 3 pm from Mondays to Thursdays while the working hours for Fridays are from 8am to 12 noon. Part of the statement read, “This gesture by Governor Atiku Bagudu is in line with the established tradition of the state and in consideration that the reduced working hour could lessen the effect of fasting on civil servants in this Holy Month of Ramadan.”
