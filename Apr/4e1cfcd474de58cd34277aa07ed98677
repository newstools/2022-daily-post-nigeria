Nigeria is besieged with hydra-headed crises, at the same time; undoubtedly, we are in one of the most challenging times in our history as a nation since 1960. It has never been this worse in our story as a nation. Major sectors of our national life are bogged in elephantine challenges. Students in public universities have been at home for months in another round of strikes by the Academic Staff Union of Universities. The power and energy sector is comatose, with perennial total blackout, grid collapse, fuel scarcity, and unprecedented hikes in prices of cooking gas, diesel, Jet Ai fuel, and others. The economy is wobbling, businesses, travellers and foreign students no longer have access to FOREX, pay unimaginable charges and taxes as well as taxpayers whilst constant electricity supply, affordable health care, social security, food, water, the safety of human lives and property, are continually absent. Amid all these woes, terrorists continue to assail our nation, the dastard attack on an Abuja-Kaduna train being the most recent. No doubt, major aspects of national life are crumbling. Nigeria is at war, as attested to by Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el-Rufai; and Presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina. Nigeria’s unfortunate situation sadly fits Section 305 of the 1999 Constitution and President Muhammadu Buhari should earnestly declare a state of emergency in the power, energy, security and education sectors especially. The ministers in these sectors should be suspended to rescue Nigeria from total collapse. If in the forthcoming elections, we indeed want to move forward as the pride of the black race with over 200 million population and natural resources and retain our spot as the giant of Africa, all sectors need a complete overhaul.
