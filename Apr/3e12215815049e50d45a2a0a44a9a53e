Family members of the kidnapped Kaduna-Abuja train passengers have criticised the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, for launching his presidential campaign, without due regard for the victims, languishing in the abductor’s den. This was contained in a statement by the leader of the victim’s relatives group, Dr Abdulfatai Jimoh. Jimoh warned the Nigerian Railway Corporation management against attempts to resume train services. He also urged the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), to suspend plans to resume train service, wondering how the Minister will direct the resumption of rail services without a concrete plan to rescue passengers abducted in the bombed train. The family members through Jimoh said it was most uncharitable that Amaechi, under whose watch the attack occurred as a minister, could only celebrate rather than resign after the attack. He said the first thing should be to get the captives out and then put adequate measures in place to ensure the attack does not happen again in future “We want to believe that they won’t try it and if they do, we won’t take it lightly with them because human lives are involved. We believe they won’t. We believe they won’t because they know what’s at stake.” he said Fatima Ciroma, whose sister is among the victims, regretted that the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi declared his intent to vie for presidency shortly after the attack. She called on Nigerians not to elect the likes of the minister as president in the 2023 presidential election because “he is inhuman.” Meanwhile, the bandits have threatened to kill all hostages in their custody if the federal government refuses to dialogue with them.
