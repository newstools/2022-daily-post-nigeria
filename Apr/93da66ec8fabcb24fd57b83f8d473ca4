Arsenal legend, Ian Wright, has admitted he does not think his former side can steal the fourth spot from Tottenham Hotspur. The Gunners were favourites to finish in the last Champions League place, but have lost form recently. A recent capitulation has seen Mikel Arteta’s men lose to both Crystal Palace and Brighton and subsequently surrender their fourth-placed position to Spurs. Their North London rivals, on the other hand, have been in fine form of late, with Antonio Conte’s men winning four from their last four. As a result, the Gunners are now fifth, three points behind Spurs and with a game in hand. Speaking on the Arseblog podcast, Wright said: “We are not creating as many chances as we should, we are the lowest goal scorers in the top five. “We need goals man, there’s no way – when we lose Tomiyasu, Thomas Partey, Kieran Tierney – there’s no we can stay in that top four with the players that we have got at the moment without them three in it. “They are three of the mainstays in our team and when you are not scoring as well, it’s frustrating watching them.” Wright went on to admit that he has already moved on from the idea of his old side failing to finish fourth and is instead worried that the last two results are the start of a bigger decline. “I can’t stop thinking about what we are going to do, I don’t want us to slip away,” Wright added. “I’m not bothered about fourth because I knew our team – we haven’t got the goals in it and we haven’t got the experience in it. “I’m feeling top-six, I don’t want us to start dropping and dropping back out into eights as that can have a detrimental effect on such a young squad. Have we got enough firepower to take us there (top four)? It looks like we haven’t at the moment.”
