President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has called on the police and other security agencies to investigate the death of gospel artiste, Mrs Osinachi Nwachukwu. Lawan said the lives of Nigerians matter and must be accounted for by those in authority when death occurs. He spoke during a plenary session before the Senate held a minute silence in honour of Osinachi. Coming under Order 42 of the Senate Standing Orders on Personal Explanation, Senator Ifeanyi Ubah (Anambra South), drew the attention of the chamber to the mysterious death of the singer. Reacting, the Senate President called for an investigation to unravel the actual cause of death. He said, “The authorities should investigate the death of this citizen, and the lives of every citizen must matter. This is one death too many.” It’s believed that Osinachi died due to complications suffered as a result of domestic violence. The singer was said to have sustained internal injuries suffered from her husband, Peter Nwachukwu.
