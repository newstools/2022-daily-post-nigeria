Senate President, Dr Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, on Tuesday, warned Multichoice Nigeria not to dare Nigeria by going ahead to hike the tariffs of its products while the matter is yet being investigated. The Senate President said no foreign country under any guise should take Nigeria for granted. His stern warning was at the backdrop of complaints lodged at the upper legislative Chamber, leading to resolutions that there should be no price hike and that it should as well revert to pay-per tv service. Inaugurating a seven-member adhoc Committee of the Senate headed by the Senate Deputy Chief Whip, Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi, Lawan said the Committee which was set up on Wednesday, 30th April, 2022, should investigate tariff hike by the Multichoice pay TV service provider, DStv. He said Nigeria had places for foreign investment, but wasn’t an invitation to breach its laws, insisting that there were enough laws to punish erring foreign companies. He maintained that Consumers would be protected at all cost, while he urged Multichoice to stay action on increase in tariff untill after the outcome of Senate investigative Committee, adding that the setting up of the Committee was in consonance with parliamentary rules. “Meanwhile, stay action. No increase. And that is to say don’t dare our country. No increase in tariffs,” the Senate President warned. “When the legitimate interests of our people are threatened, we are supposed to ensure that we protect them. “It has been the practice of many companies, especially foreign companies operating in Nigeria to treat the Nigerian consumers of their products in a different way and manner that is not consistent with global best practices,” he said.
