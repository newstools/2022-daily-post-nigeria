President Muhammadu Buhari has told the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) that he was confident his policies would make Nigerians return the party to power come 2023. Buhari said this when he received the new National Chairman of the ruling party, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, at the State House, in Abuja. A statement by Garba Shehu, the President’s spokesman, said that Buhari told the party Chairman that reflecting on his policies in the last seven years, Nigerians would jump at any opportunity to vote for the APC again. “When I reflect on policies of the administration on the economy and specifically in the development of agriculture, infrastructure, ICT and innovation and the welfare measures we have put in place for women, the youth and the less privileged members of the society, I get fresh confidence that our citizens will continue supporting the APC in our electoral battles,” Buhari said. Buhari further promised to make Nigeria a better place before handing over to the next administration, adding that the policies and programmes of his government were aimed at nothing, but the betterment of the people. Meanwhile, the President used the opportunity to hail Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee.
