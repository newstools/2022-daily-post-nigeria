Chelsea defender, Thiago Silva, has taken to his Twitter account to reflect on his side’s Premier League 4-1 defeat to Brentford on Saturday.. Silva played all 90 minutes in the Premier League match at Stamford Bridge that saw Thomas Tuchel’s side concede four goals against Brentford. A brace from Vitaly Janelt and a strike each from Christian Eriksen and Yoane Wissa ensured Brentford defeated Chelsea in front of their home fans. Antonio Rudiger did score a goal for the Champions League holders. Reacting, Silva insisted that Chelsea will keep pushing ahead of their Champions League quarter-final clash with Real Madrid on Wednesday evening, adding that ‘only God keeps you standing.’ The former Paris Saint-German centre-back tweeted: “Good days make you happy. Bad days bring you experience. Both are essential for life. “Happiness makes you good, but troubles make you strong. Pain keeps you human, falls keep you humble. “Success keeps you bright, but only GOD keeps you standing (Denzel Washington). WE keep going.”
