The UK Defence Ministry has revealed that Russia has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbas city of Ukraine. It also said that without sufficient logistical and combat support in place, Russia is yet to achieve a significant breakthrough against Ukraine. The UK Defence Ministry disclosed this in a series of tweets via its Twitter handle on Monday while providing the latest update on the situation in Ukraine. It tweeted: “Russia has made minor advances in some areas since shifting its focus to fully occupying the Donbas. Without sufficient logistical and combat support enablers in place, Russia has yet to achieve a significant breakthrough. “Russia’s decision to besiege rather than attack Mariupol’s Azovstal steel plant means many Russian units remain fixed in the city and cannot be redeployed. Ukraine’s defence of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness. “Russia’s Ministry of Defence has proposed compensation payments for the families of deceased service personnel be overseen by military rather than civilian officials.” The war between Russia and Ukraine started in February and a lot of casualties have since been recorded as a result of the conflict.
