Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has declared his readiness to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. He spoke on Friday in Ibadan, the Oyo capital, during a courtesy call at the palace of the Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Lekan Balogun Ali-Iwo Okunmade II. Osinbajo, who is seeking the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC), intimated the monarch of his intention to lead Nigeria. The VP said in seven years, he has been involved in governance because the President considered it the right thing to do. “In his generosity, and openness, he gave me every opportunity to serve, including sensitive international assignments. “I also acted as President during certain periods when the President was away and everything I learnt as acting President has prepared me to run as President of our country.” Osinbajo said God doesn’t make mistakes and has given him opportunities to understand governance at the highest level of our country. “All of it was not just so that I can sit down and write a memoir, no, it was to come handy one day and I believe the time has come. “One advantage I would have is that on day one, I can hit the ground running because I know what it takes”, he added.
