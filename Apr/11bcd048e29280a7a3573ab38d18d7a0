A chieftain of Ohanaeze Ndigbo socio-political organization, Chuks Ibegbu, on Monday, criticized Vice President Yemi Osinbajo for declaring for the Presidency. Ibegbu said it’s morally wrong for Osinbajo to declare for the presidency at such a time. The former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze, disclosed this to DAILY POST. Ibegbu pointed out that Osinbajo had the right to run for the Presidency. He, however, noted that Osinbajo and other non-Igbos should wait for another eight years and allow the South-East to rule Nigeria in 2023. “Well, it’s morally wrong, though he has the right to. Osinbajo and other non-Igbos should tarry in the interest of national unity,” Ibegbu told DAILY POST. On Monday, Osinbajo declared his intention to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. He made his intentions known after a consultative meeting with some governors elected under the APC, last night, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.
