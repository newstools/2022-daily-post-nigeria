The People’s Democratic Party, PDP, in Akoko North-East Local Government Area of Ondo State has passed a vote of no confidence on Rasheed Elegbeleye, the member of the House of Assembly, representing Akoko North-East state constituency. The party in the local government moved against the lawmaker over alleged poor performance. Yusuf Hamzat, the party’s leader in the local government stated this while strategizing ahead of the 2023 general elections at the party’s secretariat in Akure, the state capital. Speaking at the secretariat, Hamzat introduced another member of the party, Akintola Olarewaju, as a substitute for the incumbent lawmaker ahead of the 2023 polls. “At the last meeting we held at the party’s secretariat, what we heard about our representative was not palatable. So we resolved to look for the best alternative. “As far as I’m concerned, PDP is the party to win in Akoko North-East because we are firmly rooted. We are going to deliver successfully, and we are very sure that the person we are presenting will win.” On his part, Fatai Adams, the party’s state chairman, said if a consensus candidate cannot be found, the party will conduct a free, fair, and credible primary.
