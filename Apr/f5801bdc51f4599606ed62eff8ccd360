A woman in Adamawa State has been arraigned in court for allegedly hiring three children to break into the house of her co-wife and steal her things. The Criminal Area Court I in Yola, Adamawa State before which the woman, Monica James is arraigned, has remanded the woman and the three kids in prison custody and remand home respectively for housebreaking and theft. The order of the court followed the arraignment of the accused persons before the court for criminal conspiracy, housebreaking, theft and for being in possession of stolen properties. Monica, a nursing mother who resides in Jambutu Nyakore, in Yola North Local Government Area, allegedly paid N6,000 to Haruna Abubakar, 13; Maryam Mohammed, 12; and Hauwa Mohammed, 14 to steal and vandalize the property of her co-wife, Esther James. While Monica, Maryam, and Hauwa pleaded guilty to the allegation, Haruna who is the only male among them, denied the charge. Haruna told the court, “I didn’t enter the room. It was Hauwa and Maryam who entered through the window.” According to Haruna, Monica and Hauwa went and sold the stolen wrappers and other property after the operation. “I was given N1, 000 only as my share,” he said. Information from the court indicates that the children broke into Esther’s room and took 13 wrappers, boxes of other valuables not specified, a pot, two measures of rice, two measures of beans, and some other household items. The items have been valued at N166,000. The Police Prosecutor, Corporal Mohammed Ismail, said the incident occurred last Friday, April 22, when Esther James, who is the complainant in the case, left for Chigari in Fufore LGA. Ismail disclosed, however, that ten wrappers of the stolen items had been recovered.
