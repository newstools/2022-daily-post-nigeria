Manchester United’s next permanent manager, Erik ten Hag, has warned Cristiano Ronaldo and the rest of the club’s superstars that he will not change his tactical approach to accommodate their needs. Ten Hag will take over from interim boss, Ralf Rangnick, after the current campaign ends. The 52-year-old has already agreed a three-year deal to leave Ajax for Old Trafford. Speaking now ahead of his arrival, Ten Hag told Dutch newspaper Trouw: “I will not change my view on coaching. The type of players you have determines the way you play, but I’m in control of the demands and tasks that are asked of the players. “I decide what task a player has. If someone doesn’t perform his tasks, he will be made aware of that, no matter whom it may be. I will not compromise on that. I make demands about the way I want to work before I sign. If those demands aren’t met, I’m not signing. “The buck stops with me and I will be judged on the results of the team. I don’t want to be a dictator, I want to work together, but I wanted to have a say in transfers, that was a condition for me.”
