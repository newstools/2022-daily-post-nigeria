Manchester United board are unhappy with interim manager, Ralf Rangnick’s claim that it will take six years for the Old Trafford club to catch Liverpool in the battle for the Premier League title. Man United’s season hit another low point this week as Rangnick’s men were thrashed 4-0 against Liverpool at Anfield. The result has left Man United three points behind Arsenal and Tottenham in the race for the fourth position this season. Speaking after Man United’s defeat to Liverpool, Rangnick delivered an honest assessment of the squad and how far they are off challenging for the Premier League title. “We have to accept they [Liverpool] are six years ahead of us now,” Rangnick said. “When Jurgen Klopp came [to Liverpool in 2015] they changed at the club and lifted not just the team but the club and city to a new level. That is what needs to happen with us in the next transfer window,” he added. However, according to The Telegraph, Rangnick’s comments ‘did not go down well’ with those behind the scenes at Man United, who believe the club can be improved in a shorter timeframe. Man United have since announced that Erik ten Hag will replace Rangnick as manager at the end of the season. The Dutchman signed a three-year deal with Man United as Rangnick is set to move into a consultancy role this summer.
