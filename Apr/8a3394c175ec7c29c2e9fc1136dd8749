Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel has claimed that the same mistake his team made during their Champions League quarter-final defeat to Real Madrid cost them the loss against Arsenal on Wednesday night. Tuchel said this when explaining why he substituted Thiago Silva at half-time during Chelsea’s clash with Arsenal. Goals from Eddie Nketiah, Emile Smith Rowe, and Bukayo Saka gave Mikel Arteta’s side a 4-2 victory over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Speaking after the game, Tuchel said at his post-match press conference, “You cannot win football games like this. It’s not about individual players. It’s about the defensive performance. “He [Silva] said he cannot continue. I do not substitute a player for one mistake. “We had the same mistake against Real Madrid that cost us the next round in the Champions League. This one cost us this match.”
