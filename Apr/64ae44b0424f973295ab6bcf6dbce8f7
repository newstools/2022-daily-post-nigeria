Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh has reacted to the disturbing video of a 10-year-old female Chrisland student who was allegedly gang-raped and abused by some students. The footage shows the pupils in a sexual act which the mother of the female student says was done under the influence. Tonto opined that from the video, it’s not the first time the young girl would have sex. According to the actress, the young girl has an older groomer somewhere. On her Instagram story, Tonto wrote: “Ok so I just watched the Chrisland video all I can say is that is not rape, that 10-year-old girl knows sex in my opinion it’s not her first nor fifth time. “She has a much older groomer somewhere.” Tonto urged the family to ask the minor some more questions to find details. She also added that Chrisland school is guilty of sealing the truth from the parents. “The family needs to ask the right questions and protect the girl more. Please stop sharing the video,” she wrote. “The school is GUILTY for Concealing the truth on such a HORRIBLE CRIME! Our leaders need to do better. My opinion comes from a 52sec video I watched.”
