Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp has warned his players that they still have work to do to reach the Champions League semi-finals regardless of their quarter-final first leg 3-1 win over Benfica on Tuesday. Klopp watched as Liverpool defeated Benfica in a Champions League quarter-final first leg tie in Lisbon. Three goals from Ibrahima Konate, Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz gave Liverpool the first-leg advantage ahead of the second leg next week. But Klopp believes the game is not yet over ahead of the second leg in Anfield. “No, this game is not done,” Klopp said at his post-match press conference. “The game was slightly more open than we wished, but in the end we scored. “I think everyone in the room would agree we could have scored more goals. “We were two goals up and we knew it was not easy. Now they come to Anfield and we have to use that,” he added.
