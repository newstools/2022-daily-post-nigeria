Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has faulted the declaration to run for the office of President by the Transportation minister Mr. Chibuike Amaechi. HURIWA wondered who advised the minister to take such a decision at a time the nation was still mourning those unlucky train passengers killed by terrorists in Kaduna on their way from Abuja. The group also reminded the minister that nearly two hundred passengers are yet to be accounted for while he was busy organising an elaborate political ceremony to announce his intention to contest for office of president. “This is shameful and heartless to put it mildly,” HURIWA said in a statement signed by its National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko and made available to DAILY POST on Sunday. The human rights advocacy group thinks the timing of Amaechi’s declaration was wrong. Amaechi’s declaration was witnessed by All Progressives Congress bigwigs including former national chairman Adams Osiomhole, Plateau State Governor Simon Lalong, Senator Ali Ndume, Senator Ifeanyi Ararume and Idris Wase. HURIWA, however, said “The minister did not show enough remorse about the massive official negligence that occasioned the killings of scores of train passengers just as it amounted to dancing on the graves of those innocent souls killed by North-West terrorists. “It was wrong for the Transportation Minister to be seen using public facilities to dance around and then announce that he will run for office of the president even when train passengers numbering over 200 are at the risks of being killed by the terrorists who took them off the publicly owned train to the forests only because the Federal Government has abdicated her constitutional duty of protection of lives and property of citizens.”
