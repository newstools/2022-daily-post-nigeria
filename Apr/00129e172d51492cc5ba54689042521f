Newly appointed Manchester United manager, Erik ten Hag has already identified Hannibal Mejbri, Alejandro Garnacho and James Garner as three youngsters to add to his XI at the club. Erik ten Hag was confirmed the new Manchester United manager on Thursday and will replace Ralf Rangnick at the end of the season on an initial three-year contract. Ten Hag will be backed by the Manchester United hierarchy to undertake drastic improvement at Old Trafford following a woeful season, which has seen United struggle to qualify for Champions League football next term. The Guardian reports that the Red Devils have already told their incoming boss that he will not receive a ‘lavish budget’ but instead will be given ‘adequate funds’ with which he can sign improvements. The report claims that Ten Hag has split the United squad he will inherit into four groups – those that are the top of their careers such as Raphael Varane, Bruno Fernandes and David De Gea; those who are close to reaching that, including Marcus Rashford and Scott McTominay; those who are still rising up such as Jadon Sancho and then the academy players he believes have a ‘bright future’, including Mejbri, Garnacho and Garner. Mejbri made a combative cameo in United’s 4-0 defeat to Liverpool this week, while Garnacho is yet to make his first-team debut. Garner is another youngster who has impressed during his loan spell with Nottingham Forest this season.
