Barring any last minute change, the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, will on Saturday, disclose his position on the 2023 presidential election. A top presidency source told DAILY POST that Osinbajo feels it’s the right time to address the 2023 issue with regard to his ambition, considering the fact that the election is close. It’s not, however, certain if the nation’s number two man will declare interest to run or step aside due to his loyalty to a former Lagos Governor, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who is believed to be his political godfather. Tinubu has since declared his interest for the number one seat and has now commenced consultations. Recall that many groups had emerged in support of Osinbajo’s candidacy even though the V.P is yet to make a clear statement on his 2023 ambition. Recently, Osinbajo’s spokesman, Laolu Akande, had dismissed claims that his principal would contest for the 2023 Presidential election.
