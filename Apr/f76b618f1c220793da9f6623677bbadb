Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel has said he is happy that Mateo Kovacic is his player at Stamford Bridge. He also said that the Croatian midfielder looks like a ‘wonderkid’ in training as the Blues prepare to face Real Madrid in the Champions League, on Wednesday. Chelsea, who are title holders, play 13-time winners, Real Madrid at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night for the first leg of their quarter-final tie. Kovacic will hope to impress against Real Madrid, a club he left to join Chelsea in 2018 and would like to help the Blues move one step closer to retaining their crown. “He looks like a wonderkid in training in some exercises. Today he had an outstanding training session,” Tuchel told his post match press conference on Tuesday when asked about Kovacic’s development. “I am very happy that he is my player and plays a lot this season. He is crucial to us on the pitch and off the pitch. He knows what it takes, what culture is needed at a big club,” he said. The German boss said he had monitored Kovacic’s development right from when he was still at Real Madrid and knew the Croatian was going to become a great player. Having missed out on winning the Premier League title this season, Chelsea’s only hope of winning a major trophy is now the Champions League, which they won last season.
