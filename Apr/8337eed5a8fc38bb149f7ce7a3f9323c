Alhaji Lai Mohammed, Minister of Information and Culture, has urged Nigerians to help the government in the fight against bandits and insurgents by exposing the terrorists living in their neighborhoods. Mohammed disclosed this during a Bond FM Radio programme in Lagos on Saturday monitored by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). He noted that the investment by the federal government in tackling insecurity would be more successful if the citizens on their part would not harbor the criminals living in their neighborhoods. Mohammed said, “We are also pleading with Nigerians to join in this fight because they have a lot of roles to play in tackling this insecurity. “This is because these criminals called bandits are living among us; they interact with the people as well. Who are the ones supplying them food more, so they also have landlords? “People should expose these criminals and then, the various efforts of the government will be effectively complemented and we will see the results.”
