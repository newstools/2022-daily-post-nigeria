British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, on Saturday, paid a surprise visit to Ukraine’s President, Volodymyr Zelensky, in Kyiv. Johnson thanked the Ukrainian President for having him at a short notice, promising to send Ukraine 120 armoured vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems to expel Putin’s invading army. Johnson in a statement applauded Ukraine for defying the odds and fighting back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv, achieving the greatest feat of arms of the 21st century. His statement read, “It’s because of President Zelensky’s resolute leadership and the invincible heroism and courage of the Ukrainian people that Putin’s monstrous aims are being thwarted. “I made it clear today that the UK stands unwaveringly with them in this ongoing fight, and we are in it for the long run.” Johnson revealed that the UK is stepping up its military and convening a global alliance to bring this tragedy to an end and ensure Ukraine survives as a free and sovereign nation. The Prime minister also promised an additional £385million in World Bank lending to Ukraine.
