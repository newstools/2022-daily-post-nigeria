The Katsina North Senator, Ahmed Babba Kaita, has defected from the All Progressives Congress, APC, to the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Kaita explained that he joined the PDP because the party represents his “ideals” as a representative of the people. He accused the state Governor, Aminu Masari, of “willful refusal” to preserve the basic foundation of democracy and of marginalising critical stakeholders in the party. President Muhammadu Buhari is from Daura, one of the local government areas under Kaita. A statement by Kaita’s aide, Abdulkadir Lawal, reads partly: “Of notable implication among many of these numerous concerns is the gradual loss of credibility in Governor Masari-led administration, particularly in the avowed refusal to conduct local government elections across the state in time.” The lawmaker lamented that the people of his constituencies excused deprivation, poverty, and hunger for too long. He accused Masari’s administration of refusing to uphold the basic foundation of democracy and marginalizing critical stakeholders in the state. “Senator Ahmad Babba Kaita is not a bandwagon politician. His exemplary and robust representation in the Nigerian Senate is to the admiration of all, and with significant, visible impacts in the areas of infrastructural and human capital development across the three Senatorial zones of the state. There is room to do more,” he said. “The fresh page from the decision to join the Peoples’ Democratic Party represents the ideals of representativeness in the mandate, goodwill and an even more determined desire and opportunity to provide succour, comfort and the much-needed dividends of democracy to the people.”
