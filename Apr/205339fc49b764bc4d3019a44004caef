Pep Guardiola has poured cold water on speculation linking him with the Brazil national team job if he leaves Manchester City. It was claimed that Guardiola has been offered a deal worth £10million per year to replace current Selecao boss, Tite. Tite is set to quit the role after this year’s World Cup in Qatar. Guardiola has in the past, expressed his desire to move into international football, with Brazil believed to be his dream pick. But the Spaniard has quickly moved to shut down the reports. Speaking ahead of City’s Premier League clash with Liverpool on Sunday, he said: “I am under contract here. I am so happy here. “Now is not the moment (to discuss the links). I don’t know where that comes from.” When asked specifically about the iconic Brazilian side, Guardiola added: “It is a fantastic national team. Brazil is always a strong candidate or the favourite. It always was and it will always be.”
