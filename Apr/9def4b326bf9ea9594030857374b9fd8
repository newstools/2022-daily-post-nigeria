The Director-General of the Bola Tinubu campaign organization, Abdulmumin Jibrin has warned the All Progressives Congress, APC, ahead of its primary elections. Jibrin said how the APC managed its primary elections from the State to the Presidential, would determine the survival of the party. He said APC would be doomed if the people’s choice was not allowed to prevail. The former member of the House of Representatives, disclosed this in a tweet on his verified Twitter handle. According to Jibrin: “I have said it repeatedly, how the APC manages its upcoming primaries at every level (States and national) including Presidential will determine the survival of the party. “Anything short of allowing the choice of the people to prevail in the primaries will spell DOOM for the party!” Jibrin recently said Tinubu remained the best choice despite his alleged health issues. He urged those criticizing Tinubu to mobilize their own presidential candidate and leave Tinubu alone.
