Butchers operating at the Potiskum Main Abattoir in Yobe State have lamented the poor condition of the facility. They raised the concern while speaking to newsmen, noting that despite huge revenue being collected by the local government authority, the state of the abattoir is posing a serious health challenge to them and their host community. A recent visit to the abattoir revealed that the butchers still employ old methods of dressing slaughtered animals in addition to dilapidated structures. One of the butchers, who was visibly furious and pleaded anonymity, said the abattoir lacks a functional water facility, electricity, a decent toilet, an access road as well a perimeter fence. “We don’t have a slaughter slab. The roofing as you can see have been blown up by wind a long time ago, we don’t have a single functional toilet, no good access road into the abattoir, no gate, poor fencing”, he said. He appealed to Potiskum Local Government Council to come to their aid by rehabilitating the facility to enable butchers to conduct their businesses in a most hygienic environment. The stink of waste coming out from the abattoir is also causing serious discomfort for the residents of the area due to the huge animal wastes usually dumped behind the abattoir on the outskirts of Potiskum town. Some of the residents like Abdullahi Umar said the odour emanating from the facility is unimaginable as it is polluting the entire area, thereby posing a grave challenge. “I find it difficult to spend time outside my house due to the bad smell of cow waste. “Most of my neighbours barely stay outside for about 15 minutes because of the bad smell which increases”, he lamented. Efforts to get the Chairman of Potiskum Local Government Council to speak on the matter proved abortive and he is not returning calls made to him nor replying to text messages sent to him.
