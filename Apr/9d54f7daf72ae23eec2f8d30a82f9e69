Deji Adeyanju, a popular Abuja-based activist, has described the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government as weak and ineffective. Adeyanju was reacting to the 14-day ultimatum issued by a terrorist kingpin in Zamfara State, Nasanda. Nasanda had issued a 14-day ultimatum to the Zamfara State Government to pay him N30 million as compensation for the alleged killing of his wife and two relations. The terrorist threatened to kill 300 people if his demand was not met. Nasanda claimed that his bride, her uncle, and his aunt were killed by some vigilante men in the state. Reacting to the development, the convener of Concerned Nigerians, lamented that “terrorists can only have such audacity and courage in a country where there is no government at all or a very weak and ineffective one, which fits Buhari’s regime.” In a chat with DAILY POST, Adeyanju wrote: “These killing terrorists have seen that the country is a jungle without any form of active government from top to bottom to secure the lives of its citizens.” He further lamented that if IPOB had made similar threats, the Federal Government would have sent battalions of armed soldiers after them wherever they are, killing innocent villagers in the process. “It’s a disgrace that Buhari’s government and its military that had the guts to open fire on innocent EndSARS protesters have lost those guts to go after terrorists,” he said. He also urged the government to immediately make sure that Nasanda and his gang are arrested for this single threat and all the terror attacks and killings in the state carried out by him and his gang. “This will act as a deterrence to his kind,” he said.
