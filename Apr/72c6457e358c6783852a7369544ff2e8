The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), on Sunday, urged Nigerians to be hopeful, saying that the country would soon overcome its present challenges. Dr Samson Olasupo Ayokunle, President of the Association and co-chairman of the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council (NIREC), stated this in a statement to mark the Easter celebration. Ayokunle, who titled his Easter message; ‘Nigeria will rise again,’ said despite the efforts of the government to arrest the situation, “the scope of insecurity keeps expanding to our consternation.” According to him, besides insecurity, there are other challenges, such as mass unemployment, industrial disharmony, especially that of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), among others. He further said that despite the challenges, there were still reasons to celebrate, adding that “if Jesus died and was buried, putting his disciples in the greatest state of disappointment and sorrow, but afterwards rose from the dead, then Nigeria is going to be great again.” “Fellow Christians and Nigerians, the situation in the country today looks very gloomy. There seems to be nothing to celebrate because of unimaginable insecurity,” he said.
