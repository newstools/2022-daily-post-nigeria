The camp of Atiku Abubakar has expressed confidence that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 2023 zoning arrangement would not be against the former Vice President. Atiku’s ally Raymond Dokpesi spoke to reporters on Monday at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja. Dokpesi submitted the Wazirin Adamawa’s expression of interest and nomination forms for the presidential contest. Noting that the ex-VP had nothing against zoning, he said ” By the special grace of God, when we get to the bridge, we will cross it.” On an alleged internal crisis over the matter, the media entrepreneur said he was not aware of any problem. “No crisis whatsoever. PDP is one big family, we shall all be together as brothers and sisters. “We have nothing against whatever the party will decide, but the zoning will not be against us,” he said. The team on the arrangement is expected to submit its report this week. During the inauguration, National Chairman Iyorchia Ayu stated that zoning would be respected as it is a part of PDP’s tradition.
