Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State has implored Muslims to use the period of Ramadan to intensify prayers for the security, peace, progress and development of Nigeria. The governor made the urge in a felicitation message to Muslims on the commencement of the holy month of Ramadan. The governor’s message was posted on Saturday on his official Facebook page. Oyetola reminded Muslims of the essence of fasting in the month of Ramadan, which according to him, in the Quran is for them to attain taqwa (piety). He said, “We should, therefore, endeavour to make the most of this month by strengthening our commitment to the service of our creator, Allah and humanity. “Let those who Allah has endowed with more resources remember those in need. We should all endeavour to increase our acts of kindness and generosity by showing love and extending hands of support to the poor and the needy, as was the usual practice of our beloved Prophet Muhammad (SAW). “Furthermore, let’s take advantage of the month of Ramadan to intensify prayers for the security, peace, progress and development of our dear State and country. I pray to Allah to answer our prayers and accept all our acts of worship in this blessed month and reward us all abundantly. Amin,” Oyetola said.
