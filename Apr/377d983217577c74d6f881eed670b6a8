Cheshire police are currently in action at the home of Manchester United captain Harry Maguire after the England international received a bomb threat, The Sun reports. The police were sent to the defender’s home where he lives with his fiance Fern Hawkins, and their two daughters. They are currently searching for the bomb after the player got an email that a bomb would be placed in his home. Maguire has been heavily criticised this season for his perceived lack of form. He and his family are understood to have been left extremely shocked. The England defender was in action when Manchester United suffered a heavy 4-0 defeat in the hands of Liverpool on Tuesday.
