Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola, has provided his side’s team news update ahead of their Champions League semi-final first-leg tie with Real Madrid on Tuesday. Guardiola said he would make a final decision on the fitness of Kyle Walker and John Stones ahead of the Real Madrid clash. The former Bayern Munich and Barcelona manager also admitted that the pair are ‘doubts’. Walker has been sidelined with an ankle knock since Man City’s Champions League quarter-final second leg tie against Atletico Madrid earlier this month, while Stones missed last Saturday’s Premier League win against Watford. Meanwhile, Joao Cancelo will definitely miss the Real Madrid clash through suspension. Addressing the media on Monday, Guardiola said at his pre-match press conference: “They [Walker and Stones] are doubts, they didn’t train for the last week, ten days, John since Brighton. We’ll see how they feel, and take a decision tomorrow. “We have a training session this afternoon at 4. We’ll see how they feel. “We have time tonight and tomorrow morning to decide. I have to see today’s session to decide.”
