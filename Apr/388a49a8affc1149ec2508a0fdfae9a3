The United Nations General Assembly, UNGA, has adopted a motion on Thursday, calling for Russia to be suspended from the Human Rights Council, HRC. On its official website, the UN revealed that the resolution received a two-thirds majority in the 193-member Assembly, with 93 nations voting in favour and 24 against. Fifty-eight abstained from the process. “The meeting marked the resumption of a special emergency session on the war in Ukraine and followed reports of violations committed by Russian forces”, UN said. Prior to the vote, reports have it that Ukrainian Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya urged countries to support the resolution. He alleged that, “Bucha and dozens of other Ukrainian cities and villages, where thousands of peaceful residents have been killed, tortured, raped, abducted and robbed by the Russian Army, serve as an example of how dramatically far the Russian Federation has gone from its initial declarations in the human rights domain”. The envoy added that, “That is why this case is unique and today’s response is obvious and self explanatory”. Gennady Kuzmin, Deputy Russian Ambassador, called for countries to “vote against the attempt by western countries and their allies to destroy the existing human rights architecture.”
