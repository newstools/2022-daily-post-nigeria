A 31-year old man, Philip Ekemezie, has been arraigned before an Ondo State Magistrate Court sitting in Akure, the state capital over the alleged theft of N17m belonging to the firm where he worked. A man, John Chukwu, 50, and his daughter, Joy Mary Chukwu, 26, were also charged with receiving N361,000 and N600,000 from the suspect, respectively. The offenders were charged with stealing and receiving stolen property on two counts each. I.O Osobu, the prosecuting attorney, told the court that Ekemezie committed the crime between 2018 and 2020 by illegally converting the N17 million to his own use. The Prosecutor added that even though they knew the money was stolen, the father and daughter collected it. According to Osobu, the offence violates Sections 390(6) and 427 of the Criminal Code, Cap. 37, Vol. I, Laws of Ondo State of Nigeria, 2006. The defendants denied the charges and pleaded not guilty. Osobu, who argued against granting the defendants bail, claimed that some of those who received the stolen money were on the run and that if the suspects were released on bail, they would not be discovered again. Presiding Magistrate Damilola Sekoni granted the first defendant N5 million bail with a guarantor in the same amount, and the second and third defendants each received N500,000 bail with two sureties. The case was adjourned for hearing to April 20, 2022.
