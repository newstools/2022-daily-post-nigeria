Governors elected under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, have accused the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, of spending billions of Naira on his 2023 presidential campaign. A statement issued by the Director-General of the PDP Governors Forum, Hon. C.I.D. Maduabum, also alleged that the CBN governor is showing lackadaisical attitudes toward the crashing of Naira. They stated this while reacting to a statement by Garba Shehu, spokesman of President Muhammadu Buhari, who tackled the main opposition party for saying the current administration failed in fixing the security problems and other challenges facing the nation. According to the governors, President Buhari’s government is “unconcerned and rudderless” for watching the CBN governor allegedly campaign with public funds. The forum wondered why a person occupying such a sensitive office would be involved in partisan politics by running for the presidency. The governors said, “It is even more surprising that Garba Shehu mentioned the value of the Naira. What can we say, there is no strategy, no concerted effort to stabilise the value of the Naira. “How can there be a plan when the CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, is openly running for the office of President, spending billions in television and newspaper advertisement and other costly engagements. “This is being done under the nose of Mr President. There can be no better evidence of government adrift, unconcerned and rudderless. Without care about how the economy runs. The sheer arrogance of being in such a sensitive office and running for President is quite outstanding.” DAILY POST recalls that there have been rumours of the CBN governor vying for the top political office. He has, however, remained silent on his ambition despite campaign posters in some cities in the country.
