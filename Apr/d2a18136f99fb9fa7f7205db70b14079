A 28-year-old lady, Tina Moses, who was to wed on April 23, 2022, has been kidnapped by gunmen in Sanga Local Government Area of Kaduna State. A family source, who identified himself as Dr. Moses Ibrahim, told DAILY POST in Kaduna that her sister-in-law, Tina was kidnapped on Friday on her way to the salon to do her hair in Kaduna town. According to him, “my sister went to get her hair done in Kaduna town, but unfortunately, she was kidnapped. We did not hear from her until after two days. We called our sister whom she travelled to meet in Kaduna town. She told us, she didn’t see her. We were so worried and couldn’t sleep,” he said. According to him, “the kidnappers called and told us not to panic, that my sister is with them.” “They called on Sunday and introduced themselves to us. They only told us not to panic about our sister, and that she is with them. They did not ask for ransom at all,” he added. The Kaduna State Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige, did not pick his calls for comments.
