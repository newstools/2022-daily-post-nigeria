Traders carrying out business activities in Imo State will pay N5,000 to have themselves enlisted in a database. Addressing the traders, under the platform of Imo State Amalgamated Market Traders’ Association (ISAMATA), the Chairman, House Committee on Commerce and Industry, Hon. Samuel Ogbunikpa urged the traders to make the payment and avail themselves of the opportunity provided by the database. He stressed that the database capturing was important as it would help ascertain the number of traders in the State for developmental purposes, as well as other benefits accruing from the exercise. He warned the leadership of ISAMATA against inflating the cost of the database capturing, insisting that days were gone when executives of trade associations monopolized the benefits that accrued to traders. The Chairman pointed out that a verifiable database for traders would provide platform for government to rely upon when there is need for government intervention. Responding, ISAMATA President, Hon. Emmanuel Ezeanochie expressed his happiness for the visit, describing it as first of its kind.
