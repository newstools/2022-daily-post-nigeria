The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Benue State is considering a consensus candidate ahead of the 2023 elections. More than 32 governorship aspirants are seeking to become the party’s standard bearer. On Tuesday, George Akume, Minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs met them at a retreat in Abuja. The former Benue governor noted that a consensus arrangement was in tandem with the provisions of the party’s constitution. Akume, however, said the aspirants were at liberty to test their popularity at the primaries. “There is provision for consensus in our constitution and of course, in the Electoral Act; consensus arrangement is wonderful”, he noted. The APC leader in the state assured that the party would not impose any of the aspirants. Akume advised the gubernatorial hopefuls to set aside their differences and work for victory in 2023.
