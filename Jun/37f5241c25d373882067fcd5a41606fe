With Paul Pogba’s departure confirmed, Manchester United has held initial talks with Barcelona over midfielder Frenkie de Jong. De Jong is one of the midfielders United are looking to bring in this summer. Sky Sports News reports that a deal is not close as there would be “significant obstacles” to overcome – notably a £65 million fee and the will of the player. De Jong is a player Erik ten Hag rates highly. The Netherlands international played under him at Ajax. The 25-year-old was part of the Ajax side that lifted the 2018/19 Eredivisie title and reached the Champions League semi-finals. However, De Jong, who has made 139 appearances for Barcelona, is reportedly reluctant to leave the Nou Camp this summer.
