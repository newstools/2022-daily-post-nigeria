Three people who specialized in stealing lister power engines have been apprehended by a team of police from the CID of the Ondo State Police Command. Babajide Moses, the gang’s leader, confessed to the crime and said he routinely went to different areas in Akure where lister engines were being used and would lose them before taking them away. He told newsmen that he generally hired Mallams to help him transport the engines from their various places to the nearest Bus Stop, where he would hunt for a vehicle to charter to transport them to Owode Onirin, Kosofe Local Government Area, Lagos State. Babajide, 38, confessed to being apprehended by the police in Ilesha while en route to Lagos with two lister engines he stole from FUTA North Gate in Akure, Ondo State’s capital. The owners of the lister engines notified the police on Monday night that their generators had been stolen, according to Mrs. Funmilayo Odunlami, the state Command’s Public Relations Officer. The offenders were apprehended after police pursued them to Ilesha, where they were apprehended along the Akure/Ilesha Expressway. Bolaji Arowolo, the driver of an 18-seater Mazda bus that carried the generators, stated he had no idea they were stolen items.
