One of the opposition political parties in Akwa Ibom State, Accord Party, has denied holding a substitutive position for the state government ahead of the 2023 general elections in the state. Akwa Ibom, a PDP state, is swimming in the murky waters of allegations of forged certificates as well as false age declaration by its 2023 governorship candidate, Pastor Umo Eno as the matter is pending in court. It is rumoured that the government has concluded plan to have option B that if it does not succeed in the court, it would substitute with the candidate of Accord Party for the election. But the Chairman of Accord Party in the state, Rt.Hon Martins Inyang Ansa, in a press conference on Wednesday, described such rumour as false, saying that the governorship aspirant of the party, Engr. Emem Coffie, is not holding a substitutive candidate position for the state government. According to him, “I would want to use this medium to debunk insinuations, claims and rumours making the rounds in the state, that our great party is being sponsored by the State. “I want to state here unequivocally that the Accord (Party) in Akwa Ibom State has never received a dime from the State Government nor an individual or group of individuals. “The leadership of this great party and the winner of the 28th of May, 2022 delegates primaries elections, Engr. Emem Coffie hereby debunks such “substitutive position” as false. All members of Accord Party, supporters and the general public should please take note. “I would like to use this medium to inform the general public that, Accord in Akwa Ibom State is a product of self-sacrifice by committed members who have shown unflinching loyalty in their belief to produce the next governor of our dear state come 2023.” He, therefore, thanked the state Resident Electoral Commissioner, Mr Mike Igini for standing by the party to ensure that all who emerged winners at the primaries were listed by the umpire.
