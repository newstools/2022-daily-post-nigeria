An All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential aspirant, Bola Tinubu has urged a fellow aspirant, Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State to support his ambition. Tinubu said he is Ayade’s “senior brother,” hence the Governor should respect and support his Presidential ambition. He made the appeal during his visit to Ayade in Calabar yesterday, and was contained in a statement by Bayo Onanuga, the Director of Media and Communication of the Tinubu Campaign Organisation, NAN reports. The APC National Leader urged Ayade to endorse him during the party’s upcoming convention in Abuja. “Mine is to respect you as you respect me. I appeal to you as your senior brother and the first to declare his intention, not to endorse me today, but when you get to Abuja, you can endorse me fully. “We must have that unity of purpose. We must work together not only for the unity and economic development of Cross River, but also of the country,” he said.
