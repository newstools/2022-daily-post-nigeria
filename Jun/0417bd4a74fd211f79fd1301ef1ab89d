Serbian midfielder, Nemanja Matic’s possible new club has been revealed. Matic recently informed Manchester United that he would leave the club this summer transfer window, despite having a year left in his contract. According to football transfer expert, Fabrizio Romano, the former Chelsea star will join Jose Mourinho’s AS Roma on a one-year deal until June 2023. Romano disclosed this in a tweet via his Twitter handle on Sunday. He tweeted, “Nemanja Matić will sign a contract until June 2023 with AS Roma – with an option for further season. José Mourinho wanted him after Chelsea and Man Utd experiences. “AS Roma will let Henrikh Mkhitaryan leave on a free – he’s joining Inter, done deal.” Matic, who has been at Man United for five seasons, struggled for regular action in the Red Devils’ midfield last term. The 33-year-old joined Man United from Chelsea in 2017. He played under Mourinho during their time at Chelsea and Man United.
