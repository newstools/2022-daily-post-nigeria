Arsenal are increasingly confident that they are close to agreeing a deal to sign Manchester City forward Gabriel Jesus, according to The Times. It is understood the Brazilian is also keen to join the Gunners. However, City expect Arsenal to increase their offer which is short of their £50million valuation. Mikel Arteta has reportedly made signing the 25-year-old one of his priorities this summer. However, Arteta is aware that Jesus is set to enter the final year of his contract at City and the North London club don’t want to pay over the top for the player.
