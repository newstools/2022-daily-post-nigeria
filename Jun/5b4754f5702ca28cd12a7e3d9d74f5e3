Former Chairman of the All Progressive Grand Alliance, APGA, Chekwas Okorie, has disclosed why Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, left the party to join Radio Biafra. Okorie said the frustrations by those who hijacked APGA made Kanu and some others to leave the party for Radio Biafra. He disclosed that under his leadership of APGA, Kanu and a former Deputy Leader of IPOB, Uche Mefor, Egemba and other agitators were members of APGA. Speaking at an even in Enugu on Wednesday, Okorie said: “Things happened in APGA barely two years after it was founded, just barely a year after it triggered off a revolution in Nigeria. “We didn’t abandon the ship. We struggled to save the sole of APGA. We struggled for eight years. And the Supreme Court up to three times and no court ever ruled that APGA had a new national chairman. “In 2012, we founded UPP. In the same 2012, all our leaders from diaspora, including Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, Uche Mefor, Egemba, all of them said they were tired of the political process in Nigeria and they moved on to join Radio Biafra. “When that UPP couldn’t move forward, in 2020, we decided to try our hands with the ruling party, the APC. “We collapsed our structure into the APC. That was a difficult decision for us to make. But, at the end of the day, we weren’t too comfortable in APC. “Having been in opposition, fighting a particular course for several decades, it was not so easy to change from the characteristics that you have.”
