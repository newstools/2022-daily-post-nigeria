The New Nigerian Peoples Party, NNPP, has said alliance talks between the party and the Labour Party (LP) are progressing smoothly. According to the party, its presidential candidate, Dr Rabiu Kwankwaso, may accept being the running mate to Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the LP. There is growing speculation that both politicians may merge and form a stronger force to battle the two major political parties in the land, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC. Asked to verify the proposed alliance, the national publicity secretary of the NNPP, Dr. Agbo Major Major told Daily Trust that talks were still ongoing and he would not want to speculate. He, however, made it clear that either Kwankwaso or Obi could accept being each other’s vice. “By the time we are done with the discussions, Nigerians will be happy, whichever way it turns out to be,” he added.
