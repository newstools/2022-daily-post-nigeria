The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has submitted the name of his running mate to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). This was confirmed by Bashir Ahmaad, a former media aide to President Muhammadu Buhari, via his verified Twitter handle. Ahmaad, however, did not disclose the identity of Tinubu’s running mate. He simply wrote: “Our presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu has submitted the name of his running mate to INEC, his media office has confirmed.” The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had fixed Friday, June 17, as deadline for parties to send in names of their vice-presidential candidates.
