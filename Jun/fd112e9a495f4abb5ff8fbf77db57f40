Pastor Tunde Bakare of The Citadel Global Community Church has claimed that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission will go after some of the aspirants that contested in the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential primary. The fiery cleric made these remarks at the party’s special convention on Tuesday night. “Many of these contestants, time will tell. The EFCC will soon be after them,” Bakare said. Bakare also accused some of the contestants of “bringing delegates with delegates”. He bragged that all he did was campaign via bulk SMS and expressed his confidence he will emerge the 16th president of Nigeria. This comes after he vowed not to join others in stepping down for the APC National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.
