Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello and presidential aspirant of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has said any candidate that President Muhammadu Buhari picks as consensus will enjoy his total support. He however said he was not favourably disposed to the recommendations of the northern governors on power shift to the South, saying it is not binding on him. He bared his mind while appearing on Channels Television programme, Sunday Politics. According to him, he has the support of 60 percent of the party’s delegates. He also said he is not in a hurry to withdraw from the presidential race on account of the position of the northern governors. “If it comes from President Buhari himself, I will one hundred percent support the person if I am not selected. If it is any other person, I will support the person because that is his wisdom. He knows better than me and he sees better than me,” he said.
