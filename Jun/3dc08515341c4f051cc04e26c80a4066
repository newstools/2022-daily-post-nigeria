Former Holland manager, Marco van Basten has suggested that Paris Saint-Germain’s Lionel Messi is a better player compared to Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo. Basten insisted that anyone that thinks Ronaldo is better than Messi knows nothing about football, adding that it is impossible to imitate the Argentine captain. Messi and Ronaldo have been compared for several years in the debate of who is the best player in the world as they went head-to-head in their glittering careers. The duo are almost impossible to split when it comes to goals, assists and honours, but Van Basten has strongly stated his view on the ongoing debate. “Cristiano is a great player, but those who say he’s better than Messi know nothing about football, or they’re saying it in bad faith,” Van Basten told Corriere dello Sport. “Messi is one of a kind. Impossible to imitate and impossible to repeat. A player like him comes along every 50 or 100 years. As a kid, he fell into the football genius pot.”
