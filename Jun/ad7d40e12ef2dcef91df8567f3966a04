The suspended Accountant General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris has been released from the custody of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). DAILY POST recalls that Idris was arrested by the anti-graft agency on May 16 over alleged N80 billion fraud. But he was said to have been released Wednesday night on administrative bail. When DAILY POST contacted the spokesman of the commission, Wilson Uwujaren, he confirmed the report but couldn’t give details. He said, “yes he has been released but call me back, I’m currently driving”. Recall that barely two days after the arrest, Idris was suspended by the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed. According to the Minister, the suspension was to enable the senior government official to face probe properly.
