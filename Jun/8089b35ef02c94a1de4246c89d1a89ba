Former Manchester United and Manchester City striker, Carlos Tevez has confirmed his retirement from professional football at the age of 38 following the death of his father. Tevez cited the loss of his father, who he described as his number one fan, in early 2021, as reason for his decision to stop playing, despite having offers to continue, including in MLS. The Argentine played in the Premier League from 2006 until 2013 with West Ham, Manchester United and Manchester City. Tevez had most recently been playing at home in Argentina with his boyhood club Boca Juniors. “I have retired, it’s confirmed,” Tevez told America TV on Friday night. “They offered me many things, including from the United States. But that is it, I have given everything. “Playing the last year was very difficult but I was able to see my old man. I stopped playing because I lost my number one fan.”
