Dr. Suleiman Musa, a renowned political sociologist based in Zaria, Kaduna State has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure that those who celebrated his health crisis are not allowed to succeed him in 2023. This was contained in a statement he made available to journalists in Kaduna, yesterday. The lecturer, who teaches at the NOK University, Kachia, Kaduna claimed that while the President was away from the country during his health crisis a few years ago, some politicians wished him (Buhari) death, while others were lobbying for the position of Vice President. According to him, “some highly placed politicians in Nigeria did not believe that President Buhari will be alive today. They were already celebrating while Nigerians were praying for his quick recovery. “While I do not wish to interfere with such inalienable right, I wish to remind the president to be weary of this set of politicians who were celebrating while he was sick and hospitalized in London the United Kingdom. “Others were even positioning to be nominated as Vice President in case of any eventuality. Mr. President should not allow such politicians with a history of betrayal on their shoulders to succeed him.” Musa also told Nigerians that when the President finally reveals his preferred candidate to fly the flag of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, it should not be regarded as imposition. Report had emerged that President Buhari would on Sunday, meet with all APC presidential aspirants where he is expected to announce his preferred candidate to fly the party’s flag in 2023.
