The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has increased the number of equipment for the Permanent Voter Cards registration in Rivers State. The Commission provided more IVES machines at their state headquarters in Port Harcourt to accommodate the high demand for registration. The INEC National Commissioner in charge of voter education Festus Okoye had on Monday assured that the commission was making plans to deploy more machines to the state for the registration exercise. INEC in Rivers State also created an additional center in the media center of their office with two additional IVES machines to cater for the demands of those visiting the office. Some participants who passed through the exercise described it as “hectic”. The Commission, however, appealed to those who had registered before but needed to make corrections or transfer their voting unit to visit the INEC portal to complete the process.
