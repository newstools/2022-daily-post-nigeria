Football pundit, Richard Keys has hit out at departing Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba for his comments regarding his Old Trafford contract situation. Pogba has left Man United this summer as his contract expires at the end of this month. The France World Cup winner had slammed Manchester United in an Amazon Prime documentary, insisting that he would show the Red Devils that ‘they made a mistake in waiting to give him a contract.’ Reacting, in a tweet via his Twitter handle on Friday, Keys branded Pogba as a virus. He tweeted, “I doubt there’s anything in the Pogmentary that will persuade me that Pogba isn’t a virus & United are well rid of him. £300,000 per week – nothing? Didn’t feel loved? Please. Mourinho told me about his rows & there’s only one side to take.” Pogba spent six years with Man United following a club-record £89 million move from Juventus in 2016. The 29-year-old made 232 appearances for Man United, scoring 39 goals and contributing 51 assists.
