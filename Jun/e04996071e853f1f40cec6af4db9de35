Operatives of the Bayelsa State Police Command have arrested a middle-aged businesswoman at Twon-Brass in Brass Council Area of the State over the alleged trafficking of two under-aged girls to Ghana for prostitution. The suspect’s name was given as Madam Florence Emeka. The alleged trafficked girls, identified as Nengi, 15, and Preye, 14, were reported to have been taken to Ghana early this year for prostitution. While Nengi was said to have escaped from Ghana to Lagos with the help of some concerned Ghanaians who gave her transport fare back to Lagos, Preye is stranded in Ghana with less hope of returning to Nigeria. The Police Public Relations Officer(PPRO), Bayelsa State, Mr Asinim Butswat, who confirmed the arrest said the suspect will be transferred to Yenagoa for further investigation and possible prosecution. Reacting to the incident, former chairman of the Bayelsa State Council of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, Tarinyo Akono called on the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Person( NAPTIP) to join forces with the police to rescue Preye from her traffickers in Ghana. He told parents to investigate the kind of people they send their children to live with notwithstanding if they were relatives or not.
