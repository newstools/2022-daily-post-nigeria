A chieftain of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo socio-political organisation, Chuks Ibegbu, has disclosed what the Igbos would do if the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar picks his running mate from the southeast. Ibegbu said the southeast will not reject it if Atiku opts to pick an Igbo man as his running mate in 2023. Speaking exclusively with DAILY POST, the former Deputy Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo said the southeast would also consult round if Atiku opts for an Igbo man. Ibegbu noted that the vice presidential slot is not what the southeast aspire for in 2023. According to Ibegbu: “Atiku is at liberty to pick his Vice President from anywhere he likes, including the Southeast. Even if he wants to pick his running mate from Adamawa, no problem. Our people made up their minds that it’s the Presidency they want from the onset. “We have occupied the Presidency, Vice Presidency, Senate President, and we are saying this is the right time to have political equity by allowing the Igbos to produce Nigeria’s President. “Until such a time when Nigerians do not mind where the Presidency comes from and build an inclusive society that thinks more of merits, then things will be the way they are. “Atiku picking his running mate from Igbo land is not what we planned for, but politics is a game of possibilities, so we can’t rule out such possibilities. And like I said, it’s not yet over as there are other possibilities. Still, if Atiku says he wants somebody from the Southeast to be my running mate, we won’t reject because politics is a game of possibilities. “Our people will come back to analyze, dissect, digest, and know the implications. Don’t forget that there are people from the other side saying we don’t want to be part of this injustice in Nigeria.” Over the weekend, Atiku had emerged as PDP’s presidential flag bearer. However, he is yet to announce who his running mate would be.
