Nigerian billionaire Ned Nwoko has said that the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi cannot be the next President of Nigeria. Nwoko, husband to Nollywood actress, Regina Daniel, said this during an interview with BBC Igbo, adding that Obi will change Nigeria as a Minister of Economy. According to him, Peter Obi is a good man and has the support of Nigerian youths but Labour Party lacks the necessary structure to rule Nigeria. Nwoko also noted that the population of Nigeria is complex, warning that many things in Nigeria will work against the emergence of a president under the Labour Party. Nwoko said: “Peter Obi is a good man and has impressed me. When he came to London he came alone. He’s a capitalist and a big-time player in the business world and conservative in the way he handles things. “I’ll like him back in PDP, he’ll do well as Minister of Economy, he’ll help us turn around Nigeria’s economy. “Labour Party does not have the structure to win but they have a support base. He’s a popular candidate but cannot become president because he does not have the structure. As a president, you must have the majority of Labour Party in the House of Representatives and Senate. “Many things in Nigeria will work against the emergence of a president under Labour party, It wouldn’t happen.” Ned Nwoko added that Peter Obi should not have left the Peoples Democratic Party, and hoped that he returns.
