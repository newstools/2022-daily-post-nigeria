Manchester United have been told that they are ‘so far away’ from finishing top four next season. He said that the Red Devils will not be challenging for top four next season, despite new boss Erik ten Hag being tasked with bringing the glory days back to Old Trafford. Manchester United suffered yet another dismal season and must make some challenges and additions to stand any chance of competing with Tottenham, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City. The Old Trafford landlords have watched numerous high profile stars such as Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard, Juan Mata and Nemanja Matic leave but have not bought in any new players in the window. And former Chelsea and West Ham defender, Scott Minto, believes that United are so far off that they will not be fighting for the top four places next season. He said on talkSPORT: “I think Manchester United are so far away you can’t see them fighting for fourth next season. I just can’t see it, not at the moment anyway.” Minto replied: “Well I’m sure he [Ten Hag]is fighting behind the scenes to try and get players in. But at the moment, I’m sorry, you know the end of last season was shocking! “They are a million miles away from finishing fourth let alone going for the title.”
