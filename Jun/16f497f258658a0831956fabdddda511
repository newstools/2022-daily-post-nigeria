Colombian pop star, Shakira, reportedly had anxiety attacks days before Barcelona defender Gerard Pique’s alleged infidelity became public. Pique was allegedly cheating on Shakira with another woman. According to Hola Magazine, Shakira suffered anxiety attacks last week. The incident reportedly took place last Saturday, May 28, at around 5 pm in the evening. The 45-year-old singer was rushed to the Teknon clinic in the city in an ambulance. However, Shakira has denied the claims of a panic attack, claiming his father suffered an injury and she accompanied him to the hospital. Meanwhile, Shakira and Pique, whose relationship began in 2010, have two sons together, Milan and Sasha. A brief statement released by Shakira’s communication agency on Saturday confirmed the pair have split.
