A former federal lawmaker, Magnus Abe, has reacted to the recent statement made by a presidential aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, that he made President Muhammadu Buhari president in 2015. Abe said that the recent remarks by Tinubu in Ogun State, about his contributions to President Buhari’s emergence as President in Nigeria, is a statement of facts which no one can deny. Tinubu, the Jagaban of Borgu Kingdom, had claimed that Buhari would not have emerged as the President in 2015 without his support. Reacting, Abe, in a statement signed by his spokesperson, Parry Saroh Benson insisted that there is nothing new about the statement, which has been publicly admitted by the President himself. He added that all other aspirants in the presidential race have often talked of their own contributions to the success of Buhari, adding that Vice President Yemi Osinbajo talks of his contributions and loyalty to the President. Abe wondered why it would be a crime for Tinubu to also make public, even flaunt, his own contributions to the success of Buhari and the APC. The statement partly read: “It’s no longer news to all genuine lovers of the APC that the past seven years have witnessed all sorts of evil plots by desperate politicians to destroy the fabric of unity between President Muhammadu Buhari and the National Leader of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. “He did not say anything new, which Nigerians do not know. So, the politically contrived hue and cry about the factual statement is to create disunity between both leaders in order to promote their plots to upstage Asiwaju and destroy him in a classic ‘use and dump fashion’.”
