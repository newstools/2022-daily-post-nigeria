Incidences of vote buying have been recorded in many polling centres in the ongoing gubernatorial election in Ekiti State. Concerned individuals, who are also voters, said some persons, believed to be working for politicians, suddenly arrived at various polling centres on Saturday, to offer money to those already on the queue, with the intention of inducing them with cash. They, however, said such offers were not done in the open, as it used to be in the past, apparently to avoid attention of eagle-eyed security men on duty, as a prospective voter would just be quietly invited to a corner, a little far away from the voting unit, to collect money. It was learnt that such development was prevalent in Ado-Ekiti and Ikole-Ekiti among other areas. A minimum sum of between N5,000, N7,000 and N15,000, or more, was allegedly shared to willing voters, ready to sell his or her conscience for a fee. A voter and former member of the Ekiti State House of Assembly, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the development in Ikole-Ekiti, saying monies were indeed shared by some party loyalists, whose identities or parties, he did not mention.
