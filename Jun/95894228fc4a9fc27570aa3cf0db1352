Aregbesola congratulated Tinubu in a statement on Wednesday after what he called “hard fought victory at the just concluded Presidential Primary election of our great party”. The minister said Tinubu has “demonstrated once again that you are a dogged fighter and in your quest for the establishment of a democratic society, you are willing to go the whole hog.” He described the APC National Leader as a dogged fighter in his pursuit to establish a democratic society. In a statement he personally signed, the minister said: “I write to felicitate with you on your hard fought victory at the just concluded Presidential Primary election of our great party, the All Progressives Congress (APC). “You have demonstrated once again that you are a dogged fighter and in your quest for the establishment of a democratic society, you are willing to go the whole hog. “It is my prayer that you will ride on the crest of the momentum of this triumph to lead our party to victory in next year’s General Elections.” He stressed that the victory of the former Lagos State Governor was well deserved. Tinubu polled 1,271 to defeat his closest rival, Rotimi Amaechi, who polled 316. The Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo came third with 235 votes. Recall that Aregbesola had a fall out with Tinubu during the campaigning process. The fallout between Tinubu and Aregbesola was linked to the crisis within the APC in Osun State.
