Former National Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and Senatorial candidate of Labour Party (LP), Senator Victor Umeh, has said that he and the presidential candidate of the party, Peter Obi will join hands to build the party. Umeh said he and Obi built APGA when many people who are revelling in the party today were nowhere near it. The former senator, who spoke with DAILY POST in an interview said: “This APGA you are seeing today, which some people are revelling in, I and Mr Peter Obi took it from nothing and made it formidable.” Umeh said he has resolved to do the things that make him happy, and that he will join Obi to ensure victory for LP, as campaigning for the party’s presidential candidate all across the country will give him great joy. “I will focus on the forthcoming election. Campaigning with Mr Peter Obi around Nigeria is what will make me happy. I want somebody from the South East to be the president of Nigeria. Speaking on his plans for the 10th Senate, Umeh said: “If I win this election that is forthcoming, the 10th Senate will know that somebody who came and stayed for 17 months is now back for four years. “I will do my job democratically as I did in the eighth Senate, with any person of goodwill, to preach to Nigerians that all Nigerians must live with equal rights, all parts of Nigeria. If they want Nigeria to continue to be a country, all parts of Nigeria must be accommodated in the affairs of government, be it in the sharing of infrastructure, appointment at all levels, anything the government should do, nobody should be left behind. “There are various unrest in Nigeria today, people are rebelling because of the manner things have been handled. If you handle things evenly, people will be happy. “So, coming to Labour Party is bringing me to a familiar terrain and we will continue to fight for a Nigeria where peace and equity will reign supreme,” he said.
