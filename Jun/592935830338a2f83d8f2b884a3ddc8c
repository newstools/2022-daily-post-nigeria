Manchester United loanee Donny Van der Beek has snubbed an offer to return to the club this summer. The midfielder spent last season on loan to Frank Lampard’s Everton, who he helped to avoid relegation. The midfielder has now offered himself to the Italian side, Roma despite a potential route back into the Red Devils’ first team. The Daily Mirror reports that ever since leaving Ajax in 2020, it is clear that the Netherlands international has been struggling for game time at the Theatre of Dreams and has since been loaned out to Everton. Van de Beek, should he stay at United, could yet be joined by former Ajax teammate Frenkie De Jong – who Man Utd are also targeting.
