The Yoruba One Voice (YOV) has joined the condemnation of the killing of worshippers at a church in Owo, Ondo State. On Tuesday, the body said only regional system of government would solve “the myriads of problems bedeviling Nigeria”. YOV believes it’s high time the country’s leadership accommodated the yearnings of all ethnic nationalities. Publicity Secretary, Omoladun Orolugbagbe, said the body wants Nigeria’s existence renegotiated. “The situation in the country depends on the will of the people to put their destiny in their own hand”, the communique reads. YOV warned the targeting of Christians across Nigeria are “nothing but signs of imminent war in Yoruba land”. The organization however vowed that the “bumpy traps of detractors” against the liberation of Yoruba race will not deter the people. The statement commiserated with the families of the Owo victims, the government and people of Ondo State.
