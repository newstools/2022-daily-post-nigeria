The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress of Nigeria (TUC) have thrown their weight behind Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi. NLC and TUC made the pledge in separate addresses on Tuesday in Abuja. The NLC President, Mr Ayuba Wabba, speaking during the 10th Memorial Lecture in honour late Pascal Bafya, said NLC is solidly behind Obi and will mobilise to ensure the victory of the Labour Party in 2023 general elections. He noted that labour must dive fully into politics and work hard to support candidates whose mantra will make life better for their members and Nigerians at large. TUC President, Mr Quadri Olaleye, on the other hand said that “Obi is a face among the presidential candidates that all labour unions are pleased and are ready to work with.” Olaleye stated that the entire labour movement has accepted, adopted and will support, and ensure workers massively vote for Obi in the 2023 presidential elections. ”The Labour Party is stronger, one and formidable and the party has a widespread structure, as there is a worker and a members of either TUC and NLC in every family across Nigeria.”
