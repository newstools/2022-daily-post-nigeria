A former Commissioner for Environment in Ogun State, Engr Tony Ojeshina has emerged the gubernatorial candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 2023. Ojeshina became the candidate of the SDP in Ogun State through a consensus arrangement. The Chairman of the party in Ogun, Yinka Ola-Williams, presented the candidate to party members on Friday, saying the time had come for SDP to rule the State. Addressing party members at a gathering held at Sweet Sensation hall, Okelewo, Abeokuta, Ojeshina maintained that his desire to rule Ogun was borne out of a conviction that the people of the Gateway State deserved the best in every democratic turn. According to him, one malaise which had plagued the nation’s democratic process was the deficiency of credible leadership across board. “Our system lacks people who by dint of hard work, achieved personal successes which they want to bring to bear on public governance. Often times, the antecedent of a man is usually a pointer to the person’s capacity and competence in handling future assignments and challenges. “It is with great humility and huge sense of responsibility that I present myself to the good people of Ogun State. “Ours is a unique State in its entire ramification because it is blessed with quality human resources. We have by fate produced the brightest minds in various fields of life including Head of State, captains of industry and giants of other fields of human endeavour,” Ojeshina said. He added that, “the SDP administration under my watch will see to the total welfare of the people such that they will have free access to basic necessities of life like food, clothing, shelter, health and education at a very cheap and affordable cost. “Our administration shall guarantee social security of our people by aggressively tackling unemployment and eradicating poverty, which will also see to the human capital development of our people.”
