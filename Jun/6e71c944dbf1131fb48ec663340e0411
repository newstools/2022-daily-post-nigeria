Poland striker, Robert Lewandowski, has given a reason why he wants to leave Bayern Munich for Barcelona despite having a year left in his current deal with the Bundesliga champions. Lewandowski had already informed Bayern Munich he is leaving the club this summer. The 2021 FIFA World Best Player had already agreed to personal terms with Barcelona but is only waiting for Bayern Munich to reach an agreement with the LaLiga giants. However, speaking with Onet Sport, the 33-year-old said he is leaving Bayern because something has died in him, adding that he wants to depart the Bavarians for more emotions in his life. “No other offers were even considered by me other than that of Barcelona,” Lewandowski tells OnetSport. “I want to leave Bayern, that’s clear”. He added, “I only want to leave Bayern. Loyalty and respect are more important than work. The best way is to find a solution together. “Something has died in me, I want to leave Bayern for more emotions in my life”.
