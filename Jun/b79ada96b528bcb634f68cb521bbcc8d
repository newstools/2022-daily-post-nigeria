Juventus have reached an agreement in principle to sign Paul Pogba, according to Sky Italia. Pogba is a free agent after leaving Manchester United this summer. It is believed that small details of the contract are being sorted out. It will either be a four-year contract or a three-year deal with an option for a further year. Pogba will officially sign the contract at the start of July. The move to Juventus would mark a return to a club where Pogba spent four years before rejoining United in 2016. Manchester City also made a bid to sign Pogba from their bitter rivals, but the player opted against it and has now gone back to Italy.
