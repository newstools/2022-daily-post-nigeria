Former Leeds United striker, Noel Whelan, has explained why Manchester City striker Gabriel Jesus could snub a move to Arsenal for Tottenham Hotspur. Jesus has been heavily linked with a move away from Man City this summer since the arrival of Erling Haaland to Etihad Stadium from Borussia Dortmund. The Brazilian international has drawn the interest of Arsenal and Tottenham in the past few days. His representatives have flown to London to try and complete a £50 million (€61 million) move for Jesus. But Whelan believes that Jesus may end up choosing to join Tottenham instead of Arsenal due to Champions League football next season. Recall that Tottenham will play Champions League football next season after finishing fourth position ahead of Arsenal (fifth) on the Premier League table last season. “The only more attractive thing about right now is Champions League football and that is what Jesus has had ever since he’s arrived at Man City. Big players want to play on big stages and it doesn’t get any bigger than the Champions League,” Whelan told Football Insider. “If Tottenham are serious about landing Jesus, then, for me, with what Arsenal are building and what Tottenham are building, there’s not too much between the two in terms of stadiums and facilities. Obviously, Tottenham’s [stadium] is brand new, but you are not going to turn your nose up at playing at the Emirates. “The only thing for me is that competition. When you’ve been playing in it for five years, it’s difficult to leave it. I think Jesus would want to be part of that. That means Tottenham is a more attractive offer.”
