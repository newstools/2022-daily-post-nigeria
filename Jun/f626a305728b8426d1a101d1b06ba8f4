Senator Francis Alimikhena has been elected as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) senatorial candidate for Edo North in the 2023 election. Alimikhena won at the party primary held on Saturday, in Auchi, having polled 181 votes to win the ticket. The primary followed the withdrawal of the winner, Victoria Edelokun, from May 23, 2022 exercise, from the race for personal reasons. It will be recalled that Senator Alimikhena recently defected to PDP after withdrawing his membership of the All Progressives Congress, APC in the state. Alimikhena will now slug it out with Adam Oshiomhole, a former national chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, who is the party’s flag bearer in 2023.
