The management of the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON), on Sunday, held strategic operational review meeting in Abuja with a view to assessing the level of progress in this year’s Hajj operations. The management team led by the Chairman and CEO, Alhaji Zikirllah Kunle Hassan, according to the Assistant Director Public Affairs of the commission, Fatima Sanda Usara, is not leaving anything to chance as the Hajj exercise enters its next phase. She said the operations review meeting was attended by all “essential duties personnel from NAHCON who were in the office to review Hajj operation so far”. According to her, “these meetings take place regularly under the supervision of the NAHCON chairman, Alhaji Zikirllah Kunle and three commissioners.” “The aim is to ensure no hitch goes unnoticed, and to enable the management identify any arising issue and treat it in good time before it snowballs into a problem for the operations,” she added. Recall that the NAHCON boss had last week flagged off the airlifting of pilgrims to the holy land, just as the advance team of the commission’s officials and medical personnel have been airlifted to Madinah, Saudi Arabia. The Chairman also inspected the second and third flight out of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International airport in Abuja on Thursday, on which there were pilgrims from Nasarawa State.
