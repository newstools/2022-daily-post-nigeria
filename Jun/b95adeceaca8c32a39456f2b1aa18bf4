Governors on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Monday, rejected the Senate President, Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan as the consensus 2023 presidential candidate. The governors at a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday, insisted that there must be a power shift which they noted would be too risky for the APC, if rotation was disallowed. The National Chairman of the APC Senator Abdullahi Adamu had anointed Lawan as the consensus candidate, a development that is currently causing ripples among the governors and other party stakeholders. The announcement came a few hours to the National Convention, which was expected to produce the APC’s flag bearer within the next three days. Earlier in the meeting of the National Working Committee of the APC, which was presided by Senator Abdullahi Adamu, DAILY POST learnt on good authority that some members of the Committee vehemently opposed Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan as consensus candidate. Those who opposed Lawan argued that the party must respect zoning and allow the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu and others cleared by the Screening Committee to contest, if APC must keep power at the centre. Earlier in his brief with the State House correspondents after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari, Chairman of the Northern Governors’ Forum and incumbent Governor of Plateau State, Barr Simon Lalong, made their position known in the interest of justice, equity and fair play. Lalong said: “13 of us apologised to the President for receiving the information about our position after it was leaked.”
