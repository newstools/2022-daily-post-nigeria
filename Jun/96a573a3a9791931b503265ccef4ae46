Operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) have apprehended a Nigerian-based Congolese, Kadi Kandigu, and a Nigerian, Anthony Makowulu, for allegedly attempting to export illicit drugs to the United States of America and Dubai, United Arab Emirates, at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Ikeja, Lagos. Femi Babafemi, Director, Media and Advocacy (NDLEA), in a statement, stated that Kandigu, on May 31, 2022, at the NAHCO export shed, attempted to export 2.100 kilograms of pentazocine injection and was apprehended, stressing that on June 3, 2022, Anthony Makowulu was arrested for attempting to export parcels of cannabis sativa concealed in cereal packs to Dubai through the SAHCO cargo shed. According to him, “Investigations reveal that the pentazocine consignment was being sent to Kinshasa, Congo, while a similar package containing 200 bottles of pentazocine injection intercepted a week earlier at the airport was heading for the US.” He explained that in the case of Makowulu, he was caught with eight parcels of cannabis weighing 2.90kg concealed in Nutribom Cereal cartons, among other natural packs of the cereal, as part of a consolidated cargo meant for different people in Dubai. He also explained that anti-narcotic officers in Edo State reportedly intercepted 10,280 tablets of tramadol, 2,000 tablets of diazepam, 300 tablets of swinol, 5,000 tablets of axol and 10 bottles of codeine-based syrup in the Irrua area of the state, saying that they also destroyed 5.301713 hectares of cannabis farm in Oke forest, in the Ovia North-East LGA, as part of efforts to disrupt all cannabis planting activities for the season in the state. In the past week, Femi Babafemi said that the agency explained that no fewer than 39 suspects were apprehended across drug joints raided in parts of the Federal Capital Territory and different quantities of assorted illicit drugs were recovered from them. Brig. Gen. Mohammed Marwa (retd), the chairman of the NDLEA, enjoined the officers and all other commands to remain vigilant and committed to the goal of saving Nigeria from the drug scourge.
