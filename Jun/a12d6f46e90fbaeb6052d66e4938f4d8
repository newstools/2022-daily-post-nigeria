What would have been a tragedy was averted on Monday as three persons collapsed at the Eagles Square, where top dignitaries in Nigeria, including the military, were observing a parade to mark the 2022 Democracy Day. The individuals who slumped are believed to be members of the different units of the military. They fell at different times apparently from the stress of being on their feet for hours prior to the commencement of the parade exercise. The colourful parade, presided by President Muhammadu Buhari, was well underway when a bit of commotion broke out from behind one of the parties as some security and medical personnel were seen scrambling stretchers to move those who had collapsed for urgent medical attention. They were rushed to the tents provided at the square for medical personnel where physicians successfully resuscitated them. It was not clear whether they were able to return to their duty post for the continuation of their duties. The parade was performed by four units including the Army, Navy, Air Force and the Police with a combat display by the Nigerian Army Female Corps as well as a traditional dance display representing the main ethnic groups in the country. President Buhari, who was the Special Guest of Honour, carried out an inspection of guards, which was followed by a military/police march past in a slow and quick time. There was a combined silent drill display by the armed forces and police, and a playlet performance before the advancing of the parade in review order. Former President Goodluck Jonathan was among the dignitaries who witnessed the occasion including the presidential flagbearer of the All Progressive Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.
