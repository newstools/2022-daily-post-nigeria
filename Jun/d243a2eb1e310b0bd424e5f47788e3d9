Dr. Amos Abraham, former Chairman, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Kachia Local Government has berated the federal government and the Kaduna State Government for not sympathising with 32 bereaved families of bandits’ attack victims in Kajuru Local Government. Suspected gunmen had attacked three villages in the Kajuru Local Government Area of the state and killed over 30 residents. While the residents said the terrorists were assisted by their colleagues using a helicopter, the state government claimed the helicopter was used by the Nigeria Airforce to save the lives of the residents However, Dr. Abraham who said he lost one of his nephews in the attack insisted that what happened in Kajuru can also happen to anyone, state or local government, as such, sympathising with the bereaved, can also heal the wounded. ” For close to two weeks since the attack in Kajuru, the federal government cannot even send a delegation to sympathise with the government, as such, the government did not also find it necessary, to send delegations to the bereaved families or meet with the traditional ruler in the area. Except for a denial statement issued through the Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan.” Abraham said since the attack, the survivors have been passing through hell, as there was nothing for them to eat or drink in their various IDPs, yet the government kept mute despite their cries for assistance. He asked, if this government’s ” I don’t care” attitude continues, how would the people have the confidence to vote in the 2023 general elections.
