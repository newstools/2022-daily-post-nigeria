Paris Saint-Germain forward, Kylian Mbappe has reportedly rejected teammate, Lionel Messi’s suggestion of replacing manager Mauricio Pochettino with 46-year-old River Plate coach, Marcelo Gallardoat at Parc des Princes. Reports had earlier emerged that PSG are intent on parting ways with Pochettino this summer. It has been a difficult season for the former Tottenham Hotspur manager despite leading the Parisians to win the French Ligue 1 title. However, former Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has been the man many have expected to succeed Pochettino, but he seems keen to become the next manager of the French national team. According to El Nacional, Messi has suggested Gallardo as a potential option, but Mbappe, though, doesn’t want PSG to consider the Argentine gaffer and instead wants a more renowned name from within Europe. Gallardo played for PSG during his playing career and has enjoyed success in the Argentine Primera Division.
