Alexandre Lacazette is set to leave Arsenal after five years and will return to his hometown club Lyon, according to The Athletic. Lacazette joined the Gunners in 2017 for a then club-record fee of £46.5m. Subject to confirmation, the 31-year-old will leave the Emirates Stadium with one FA Cup to his name. Lacazette made an instant impact with Arsenal, scoring just 94 seconds into his Premier League debut in a 4-3 win over Leicester City, before netting in his next two home games. His best season in an Arsenal shirt came in the 2018/2019 season with him named Supporters’ Player of the Season after scoring 13 Premier League goals, one less than his best output in that of his debut season. In the past campaign, he could only score four times, but provided seven assists.
