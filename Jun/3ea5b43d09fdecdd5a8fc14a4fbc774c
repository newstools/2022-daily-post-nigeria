Rivers Governor, Nyesom Wike met with ex-Vice President Atiku Abubakar and 2023 hopeful on Wednesday. Atiku defeated Wike and others – among them ex-Senate Presidents and governors – to clinch the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ticket last Saturday. On Monday, the Wazirin Adamawa visited his opponents in Abuja and urged them to support him. The latest meeting between Atiku and Wike is the second in 48 hours, suggesting that the chieftains were mending fences. The former VP commented about the parley in a terse statement syndicated on his social media pages. “It was a pleasure to receive His Excellency Nyesom Wike in the company of notable leaders and officials of our great party, the PDP, at my residence today,” he wrote. Atiku said he was proud of the promises the spirit of camaraderie “holds for our party as a united front that guarantees victory in the next election to rescue the country”. Earlier, Wike reiterated his vow to support whoever emerges as the PDP presidential standard bearer. “I am not going to go back on my word. We cannot abandon the @OfficialPDPNig, we will be fully supporting H.E @atiku”, he assured.
