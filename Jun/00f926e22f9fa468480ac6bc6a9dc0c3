Former Manchester United striker, Teddy Sheringham has warned his old club about the possibility of difficulties they will face in their first season under new manager, Erik ten Hag. Sheringham has warned Man United to be wary of signing Barcelona midfielder Frankie de Jong this summer ahead of the new Premier League season. “I don’t know an awful lot about Ten Hag, but he’s got a tough job on his hands. “The scale of the job at United is huge and I felt that, at this moment in time, United needed someone that knows and has experience of the Premier League, which Ten Hag doesn’t have,” Sheringham said via UK Express. He added, “I’m seeing the rumours about Frenkie de Jong. He hasn’t played in the Premier League and has been playing for Barcelona, who are expected to pretty much beat nearly every other team. “The pace and quality of the league could be a shock to the system for Ten Hag and a player like De Jong.”
