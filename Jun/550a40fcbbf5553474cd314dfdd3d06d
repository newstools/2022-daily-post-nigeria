The National President, Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU), Jonathan Asake, has called on the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government to establish a Southern Kaduna Development Commission (SOKADEC) to help address the humanitarian crisis the people are faced with following the incessant attacks leading to killings, maiming, destruction of houses and other valuables in the area. He said, “The people of Southern Kaduna are in dire need of attention of the government in rebuilding communities destroyed by suspected Fulani militias and other criminal elements that have brought down about 148 communities with unimaginable numbers of people leaving in unofficial camps with no one to cater for them but only spirited individuals, groups and other faith-based organisations.” He added, “SOKAPU is calling on the federal government and its agencies as well as state governments and its agencies to come to the aid of most of the people that have been displaced as a result of attacks by suspected Fulani militias and other criminals. “Many who have been displaced for years are living in uncomfortable places and their children are out of school for years while others are battling health issues because of the wounds inflicted on them by their attackers. The Internally Displaced Persons have for years been facing challenges of feeding while those leaving with relatives or loved ones are not finding things easy.” He also called on the international community, church organisations and other agencies to come to the rescue of the people who have been sent away from their ancestral lands by those who desperately want to take over their lands for no just course.
