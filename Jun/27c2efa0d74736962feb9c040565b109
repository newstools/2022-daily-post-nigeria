Manchester United will finally complete their first summer signing next week. The Red Devils have held positive talks with Spanish giants, Barcelona over a deal for Frenkie de Jong. United boss, Erik ten Hag made De Jong, who worked with him at Ajax, his top target this transfer window. Manchester United are desperately in need of midfielders following the departure of Paul Pogba, Juan Mata, Nemanja Matic and Jesse Lingard. Ten Hag is keen on reuniting with the 25-year-old De Jong at the Theatre of Dreams and it appeared as though United were set to miss out on a deal for the midfielder as they struggled to agree a deal with Barcelona. But Sport now reports that the Red Devils are now “very close” to agreeing a deal with the La Liga giants, believed to be worth £68m. It is claimed that United are expected to complete a deal for De Jong next week.
