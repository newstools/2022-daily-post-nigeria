The All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, has been mocked over his inability to name his running mate. Tinubu had nominated Kabiru Ibrahim Masari as his placeholder to meet the deadline set by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC. Reacting, Reno Omokri, a socio-political activist, said Tinubu has shown he is unprepared to rule Nigeria. In a series of tweets, Omokri wrote: “Nigeria does not need placeholders. We need pacesetters. Bola Tinubu calls himself Asiwaju. The literal meaning of Asiwaju is someone who opens up the front. A leader. A pacesetter. What kind of Asiwaju can’t make up his mind who his running mate should be on time? “The decisive manner with which HE Atiku won PDP’s primaries, and picked his substantive running mate (not a placeholder to be replaced) is proof that he is ready to govern, while others are not. It demonstrates an executive capacity, which Nigeria desperately needs.” Omokri also mocked the New Nigerian Peoples Party, NNPP, Rabiu Kwankwaso over his inability to name a running mate. “Tinubu is still searching for a running mate. Kwankwaso is still searching for a running mate. They are the top two alternative candidates. They knew for years they were going to run, yet did not do their homework. It is proof they are unprepared to govern as Atiku is!,” he wrote.
