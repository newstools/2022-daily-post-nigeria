Liverpool forward, Sadio Mane, has received a three-year contract from Bayern Munich ahead of a proposed move from the Reds. Mane reached the deal with Bayern Munich after agreeing to personal terms with the Bundesliga champions. This was disclosed in a tweet by respected football transfer expert, Fabrizio Romano, on Wednesday morning. According to Romano, Liverpool are aware of Mane’s desire to leave Anfield for Bayern Munich and the transfer has entered the ‘final stages’ and is now ‘really close’. Recall that Bayern Munich have had two bids rejected for the Senegalese international by Liverpool in the past. “Sadio Mané has reached full verbal agreement with Bayern on personal terms. Three year contract ready – talks will enter into final stages with Liverpool, new bid set to be submitted,” Romano tweeted. “LFC are aware of his decision: Mané wants Bayern – and it’s really close now.”
