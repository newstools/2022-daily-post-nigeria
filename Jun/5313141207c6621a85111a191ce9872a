Big Brother Naija Shine Ya Eye housemate, Boma Akpore has said that 98 percent of married men in Nigeria have girlfriends. Boma, who had come under attack and was criticized by viewers for having a romantic relationship with a married housemate, Tega Offiong Dominic-Ajebo, made this known during Thursday’s reunion show. Recall that viewers had also dragged Tega for being romantically involved with a man other than her husband, but the Cross River indigene had claimed that she was separated. Speaking on Thursday, Tega, while defending the romantic affair, told the show host, Ebuka Obi Uchendu that she decided to use marriage as a strategy on the show. She insisted that what she had with Boma was just friendship and everything that happened was just a game. Tega said, “For a fact, I didn’t go into the show as married. I went in as separated. In all my interviews, I clearly stated it. I went into the house as separated. “During our conversations and introductions, I just said well I’m married and I have a kid. That was supposed to be a strategy. “Getting deep into the show, I then discovered that this was doing something great in a bad way to me.” When asked why he thought that being involved with a married woman was good for his game? Boma responded “I didn’t say that, what I did was right or wrong but I knew something that other housemates didn’t know, Tega told me she was separated at that time.” Boma added that although society frowns at it, 98 percent of married men have girlfriends in Nigeria and most things flaunted by ladies are bought by married men.
