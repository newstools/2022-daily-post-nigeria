New Manchester City striker, Erling Haaland, has given reasons why he chose the Premier League club. Haaland’s move from Borussia Dortmund was officially confirmed on Monday. The 21-year-old has signed a five-year deal at the Etihad Stadium. “You can’t help but admire their style of play, it’s exciting and they create a lot of chances, which is perfect for a player like me,” Haaland told City’s website. The Norway international also hailed Pep Guardiola as “one of the greatest managers of all-time”. He added: “I want to score goals, win trophies, and improve as a footballer and I am confident I can do that here. This is a great move for me, and I can’t wait to get started in preseason.”
