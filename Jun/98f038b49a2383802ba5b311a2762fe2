The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) on Thursday said it only recognises the Labour Party faction that produced the former Anambra State Governor, Peter Obi as its presidential candidate. DAILY POST recalls that Jude Ezenwafor, a former chairman of LP in Anambra State, was declared the winner of the presidential primary organised by a faction of the party on Wednesday. But a statement issued by the National President of the NLC, Ayuba Wabba said that faction is not recognized. The statement reads in part, “The leadership of the NLC and TUC recognize the leadership of the Labour Party led by Barr. Julius Abure, a former trade union leader and workers are part of the leadership. “The NLC and TUC are aware of only one presidential primary which was held in Asaba, Delta State on 30th May 2022 and produced HE Peter Obi as its presidential candidate and standard-bearer.”
