Premier League new boys, Nottingham Forest are exploring the possibility of signing Nigerian forward, Taiwo Awoniyi this summer. Awoniyi, according to several reports, is keen to leave Bundesliga side, Union Berlin this summer for a club in the Premier League. Nottingham Forest have already held talks with Union Berlin and can trigger a release of €20m in his contract. Several other clubs have made enquiries about the possibility of signing the striker. The 24-year-old scored 15 goals in 31 matches across all competitions for Union Berlin last season. Awoniyi was previously in the books of Premier giants, Liverpool, but failed to make a single official appearance for the Reds before linking up with Union Berlin on a permanent deal last summer.
