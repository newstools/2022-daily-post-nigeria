Paris Saint-Germain president, Nasser Al-Khalifi, has claimed that the club rejected a €180m bid from Real Madrid for Kylian Mbappe last summer. Speaking with Marca, Al-Khelaifi claimed Mbappe wanted to remain with the Ligue 1 champions not for money. Rather, the 23-year-old is keen to remain in Paris and wants to be part of their sports project. Al Khelaifi said: “I turned down €180m from Real Madrid last summer as I knew Kylian wanted to stay at PSG. “No, Kylian’s not moved by money. He has chosen to play here for his city, his club and his country, and for the sports project.” Mbappe was heavily tipped to join Madrid as a free agent, but opted to sign a bumper new deal at the Parc des Princes.
