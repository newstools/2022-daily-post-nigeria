Chief Sam Anya, a Peoples Democratic Party chieftain in Abia State, has debunked reports of his alleged plan to dump the Peoples Democratic Party for another political party to actualize his 2023 House of Representatives bid. Recall that Anya lost the PDP House of Representatives ticket to the current Deputy Speaker of the Abia House of Assembly and the Member representing Ohafia South State Constituency, Rt Hon Ifeanyi Uchendu. Reacting, Anya in a statement issued to newsmen in Umuahia, the state capital on Saturday, maintained that he’s not leaving the PDP despite losing its National Assembly ticket for Arochukwu/Ohafia federal constituency seat of Abia state at the concluded primaries held across the state. The party stalwart in his statement said, “I’m using this opportunity to inform the general public that I remain a committed and bonafide member of the Peoples Democratic Party. “I have not defected to any party and I do not have any intention to leave the PDP.” He commended his teeming supporters across the electoral wards of Arochukwu/Ohafia federal constituency, family, friends and well wishers for their immense support to him before and during the concluded House of Representatives primary election.
