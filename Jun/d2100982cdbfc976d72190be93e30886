Oyeyemi told newsmen in Abeokuta on Monday that the duo was arrested following a distress call received by the DPO of Igbeba divisional headquarters from local vigilantes. At about 2 am, the local vigilantes at Olisa area of Ijebu-Ode, were said to have raised the alarm that “some vandals were carrying out their nefarious activities at an IBEDC transformer in the area.” Upon the information, Oyeyemi hinted that the DPO Igbeba, CSP Musiliu Doga, immediately led his patrol team to the area.
