The Lagos State Police Command has debunked claims of “Fulani boys in army uniform” making their way into the state. The Public Relations Officer, Benjamin Hundeyin, reacted to the viral video Friday night. The spokesman said the narrative behind the footage “is not only misleading but entirely baseless”. “It is most unfortunate that this is coming from supposedly enlightened people who should know a thing or two about verification of wild claims before spreading the same.” Hundeyin informed the public that the police authority in Lagos reached out to the Nigerian Army. The PRO said the military unit confirmed that the young men recorded are newly passed out recruits from Army Depot, Zaria posted to Lagos. “They are currently in the premises of 9 Brigade, Nigerian Army, Ikeja. “Lagosians are urged to disregard the videos and its accompanying message as a piece of fake news”, he added.
