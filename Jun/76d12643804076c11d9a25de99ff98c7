A Senior Special Legislative Aide to the Deputy Senate President, Mr. Henry Efe Duku has condemned the increase in tuition fees at the College of Health Technology, Ofuoma in Ughelli North Local Government Area of Delta State. In a chat with Our Correspondent, Duku asked what the sensible justification for such an astronomical increase in the fees was. He said Deltans are used to the alleged callousness of Governor Arthur Ifeanyi Okowa’s regime. According to him, “They have no regard for even commonsense. The increase is clearly thoughtless and oppressive. “Having failed to provide an enabling environment for businesses to thrive, they now think the only way to raise revenues is to punish our students who are struggling with their parents to get an education.” Duku urged Deltans to obtain their voter cards ahead of the 2023 governorship elections with a view to voting out the Governor Okowa’s governments and their traces from office. “Let Deltans get their PVCs ready. We have to sweep all traces of Okowa’s extreme wickedness from this State.” It would be recalled that the College of Health Technology, Ofuoma had reportedly increased tuition from thirty-five thousand to ninety-seven thousand naira. This has caused some reactions within the State Political circles.
