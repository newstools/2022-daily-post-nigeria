Thomas Kwagh-Kudi, member of the Benue State House of Assembly representing Makurdi North, has dumped the All Progressives Congress, APC, for the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Kwagh-Kudi alongside six other staunch members of the APC from the constituency on Tuesday announced their defection to the PDP when they met with Governor Samuel Ortom at Benue Peoples House, Makurdi. The others are Alexander Unule, Thaddeus Usende, Saawuan Uhembe, Philip Yondo, Pahav Udekor and David Anum. On why he dumped the opposition party in the state, Kwagh-said his decision to dump APC is to enable him to join hands with Governor Ortom who has done so much to develop the state and protect the people against external forces. The House of Assembly member who promised to work hard for the success of the PDP in the forthcoming elections, said his former political party, the APC lacks the capacity to provide the desired leadership at all levels. Also speaking, Mr. Alexander Anule, Thaddeus Usende and David Anum stated that Governor Ortom has put in a lot of efforts to liberate Benue people from herdsmen attacks, saying it was only fair for them to support him to do more. Responding, Governor Samuel Ortom thanked Hon Kwagh-Kudi and the others for the right steps they have taken by joining the PDP to provide development for the people of Benue State. The Governor assured them that just like he left APC for PDP and was given equal opportunity to contest and win election, they would enjoy similar benefits as other members of the party.
