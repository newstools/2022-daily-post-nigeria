The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate in Bauchi State, Ibrahim Kashim has withdrawn from the 2023 race. The Publicity Secretary, Yayanuwa Zainabari, informed newsmen of the development on Tuesday. The spokesman said Kashim withdrew from the contest citing personal reasons. The party assured that it would follow due process to replace the candidate. “The only option left for the party is to forward the name of his replacement to INEC for proper documentation”, Zainabari said. The PDP is expected to conduct a fresh primary or select another flagbearer through affirmation as required by its constitution and electoral laws. Kashim had secured 655 votes from the 656 delegates that participated in the primary poll. The politician served as Secretary to the State Government during the previous administration.
