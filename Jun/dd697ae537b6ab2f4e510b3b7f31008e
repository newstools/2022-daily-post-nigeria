Manchester United are set to dump their move for Ajax defender, Lisandro Martinez due to the player’s height. And the decision could be of an advantage to Arsenal who are also in the race to sign the player. Mikel Arteta’s Gunners have already shown interest in the player and have informed Ajax that they are willing to pay €30 million (£25.8m) for the versatile Argentine this summer. United boss, Erik ten Hag is understood to be interested in reuniting with his former star at Old Trafford but the Red Devils have yet to make an approach. However, Ajax are keen on keeping Martinez for another season and have set a €50m (£43m) asking price to scare suitors away. The Athletic’s reporter, David Ornstein, has revealed that Arsenal are very serious about signing the Argentina player from Ajax He said Manchester United would want the player for the centre-back position which unfortunately his physical requirements do not meet. “Lisandro Martinez is a firm target for Arsenal for the left centre-back role and he can also operate at left-back in the mind of Arsenal,” Ornstein told HaytersTV. “Of course, he’s played for Erik ten Hag in the past, and there are reports Erik ten Hag would like to bring him to United now. “There may also be concerns if Lisandro Martinez is tall enough for the left centre-back role because I don’t know of Manchester United looking to do what Arsenal would like, which is to use him at left-back as well. “As things stand, I think Arsenal is the most probable destination for Lisandro Martinez,” he said.
