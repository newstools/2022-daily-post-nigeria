Musa Dangiwa who said Tinubu’s critics were lost in their own senses, claimed that President Buhari did not acquire University Education, yet he rules successfully for eight years. ” The same issue was raised when president Buhari was campaigning. Some, even said he did not go to primary school, and some said he cannot speak correct English. But he is about to complete his eight years in office. President Buhari ruled over professors, academia and highly intellectuals are his kitchen cabinet members, they decide on policies, and their implementations” he said He said it’s impossible to curse anyone whom God has blessed, adding that governance is not all about certificates, and qualifications, but God’s wisdom, knowledge and understanding of the way, things should be done right. He assured Nigerians that if Buhari can rule successfully for eight years, without blemish, Bola Tinubu will rule victoriously because of his antecedents
