Liverpool winger, Mohamed Salah, has wished Sadio Mane the best of luck after he completed his transfer to Bayern Munich. Mane has officially joined the German champions in a deal worth £35.1 million. The Senegalese superstar leaves Anfield after six seasons, five of which were with Salah. The two forwards, alongside Roberto Firmino, helped form the Reds’ famous front three, which fired Liverpool to six trophies under manager Jurgen Klopp. Following the 30-year-old’s departure, Salah took to social media to thank him for his contribution, writing: “It’s been quite a ride! Thank you for all the good times and I wish you all the best in your new adventure! You will be missed by all of us.” Mane replied on Instagram by commenting: “Keep doing your things. Brother you are the best.”
