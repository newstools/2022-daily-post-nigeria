Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State, said the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will regain federal power in 2023. The Delta helmsman expressed confidence that the All Progressives Congress (APC) will be dethroned. Okowa spoke with reporters after his announcement as the party’s running mate for the 2023 presidential election. He will run with former Vice President Atiku Abubakar. The candidate assured citizens that the PDP was eager to rescue the country and rebuild it. “I am truly very excited that I have been asked to join that ticket to be able to work as the vice-presidential candidate”, Okowa said. He commended Atiku and party leaders for finding him worthy for the position. “Mr President in waiting, I must truly thank you for finding me worthy to be on this ticket. I do know that it was a very tough decision.” Okowa thanked God that among my very qualified colleagues, “even those more qualified”, he found favour. “By the special grace of God, we will work hard to ensure victory. There is no doubt that there is a great work ahead of each and every one of us.” Okowa said the build-back process would be collective and urged all of members to be part of the story. The Governor said Atiku is the only one that has been able to come out with a document that can be trusted. “In the next few weeks, you will be hearing a lot from our campaign organisation”, he added.
