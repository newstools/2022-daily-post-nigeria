Following the persistent road crashes as well as volatile security on highways, the Akwa Ibom State governor, Mr Udom Emmanuel has set up a 25-member Technical Working Group of the State Road Safety Advisory Council in Uyo to brainstorm on modalities to stem the tide. This was contained in a statement signed by the Chief Press Secretary to the Deputy Governor, Mr Ekikere Umo and made available to journalists in Uyo, on Friday. Governor Emmanuel, represented by his deputy, Mr Moses Ekpo while inaugurating the committee on Thursday tasked members on urgent steps toward reducing the alarming statistics of road accidents in the country. The governor who noted that the committee was a replica of what has already been done at the national level said, “I want you to ensure that our nation’s roads are made both safe and secure for all motorists in view of the security challenges facing the nation.” Mr Emmanuel noted that he was concerned about the safety of citizens on roads in the state, hence his decision to inaugurate the body to justify his administration’s huge investment in road construction. He further stated road situations differ from one location to another and there should be an appraisal of each scenario to create templates necessary to make the road safe for motorists and pedestrians to achieve the objective of the Federal policy on Road Safety and management. Earlier, the Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps, Akwa Ibom Command, Mr Matthew Olonisaye who is also the Secretary of the State Road Safety Advisory Council (SRSAC) said the existence of the advisory council was to help develop and deploy strategies needed to achieve the road safety vision which is to ensure that crash incidents are minimized and to also ensure that they do not result to human injury or death. According to him, the Corps diagnosis of the road safety situation in Nigeria has exposed numerous disturbing issues leading to road carnage and loss of lives and properties which prompted the development of the first National Road Safety Strategy (NRSS) 2016- 2020 in Nigeria and subsequently, 2021-2030. While expressing optimism that the joint effort of the Council and Technical Working Group will be instrumental to addressing prevailing challenges faced with road safety management, the Sector Commander lauded Governor Emmanuel for his visionary leadership in implementing policies that guarantee the safety and security of lives and property in the state.
