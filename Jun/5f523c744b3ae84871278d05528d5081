The National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, Abdullahi Adamu has lamented the exit of party men as a result of a primary election that didn’t favour many of them. Adamu was reacting to questions by the Senate Press Corps after he held a closed-door meeting with the Senate caucus on Wednesday. He, however, said, defections rocking the APC were seasonal and normal, stressing that all manner of behaviours are expected at this time. The APC boss said, he was undeterred about the ugly development but cared much about the APC under his leadership. He said: “The wave of Senators leaving APC for elsewhere is an unfortunate development when it happens, but this is a season for all manner of behaviours in the political space in the country and Nigeria is not an exception. “In every election year, this kind of subs step gives cause for people, stakeholders to sneeze. “Nigeria is not an exception and the APC is not an exception, so, I don’t give a damn what is happening in other parties. I care about what is happening at our party. You and I know that it is not just APC that this thing is happening because we are the ruling party, yes our problems are more prominent in the public glare.” Asked to speak on the extent the exit of APC members was hurtful to him, the virtually disturbed Adamu admitted that no responsible leader would claim he isn’t pained in a circumstance like this. He said: “No responsible leader would not worry losing one member not to talk of two, three. At the moment we are faced with the stark reality of their problems, but I am committed with my colleagues in the National Working Committee to face the problems squarely to see if the problems are solvable by the grace of God.”
