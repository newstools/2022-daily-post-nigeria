Local farmers in Bashu and nearby communities in the Abo clan of Boki LGA of Cross River State have refused to go to their farms or walk freely following threats from the Ambazonian militants. Farmers who spoke to our correspondent said they received threats from the militants because they provided shelters for refugees from southwest Cameroon who fled the recent resurgence of killings in Obonyi, a border town in Cameroon near Cross River State. On Sunday morning, the Ambazonian militants killed no fewer than 20 of their kinsmen who reportedly refused to join them to fight against the Cameroon government, living hundreds of others maimed and with knife wounds. One of Bashu residents who spoke to DAILY POST, Augustine Ogar said, “Currently, residents of Bashu, a Nigerian border community can no longer go to their farms in the borderline communities because of the many threats by the Ambazonians militants for hosting Cameroonian refugees. “Presently, three Cameroon communities are taking refuge in Bashu. The current refugee population in Bashu, by our estimation, is more than 2000. “We have contacted the Nigeria Red Cross and the security agencies. We are calling for assistance from individuals, and the government as feeding, shelter etc are overstretched. There is a sanitation crisis too.”
