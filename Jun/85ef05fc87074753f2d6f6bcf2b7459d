Manchester United forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, could be set for a shock move to Chelsea this summer, the UK Express reports. It is believed a potential transfer was discussed during a recent meeting between new owner Todd Boehly and Ronaldo’s Jorge Mendes. The Portugal captain is growing frustrated over United’s recruitment struggles, with Boehly planning to oversee his first window at Stamford Bridge. The 37-year-old has a year left on his current contract at Old Trafford. Both Ronaldo and new manager Erik ten Hag have spoken with excitement of another season after the Dutchman implements a squad rebuild. But despite interest in Darwin Nunez, who has joined Liverpool, Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong and Ajax winger Antony, the club are still yet to make a single signing.
