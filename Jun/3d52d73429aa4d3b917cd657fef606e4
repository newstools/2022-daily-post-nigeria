Reno Omokri, a socio-political activist, has accused President Muhammadu Buhari-administration of plotting to use Federal might to rig the presidential election in favour of the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu. Omokri was reacting to Tinubu’s use of the presidential wing of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos State. He noted that it was unethical for the Nigerian Air Force to allow Tinubu’s jet to use the presidential wing of the airport. In a series of tweets, Omokri explained that Tinubu is not Nigeria’s president nor does he represents the Federal Government and as such had no right to use the presidential wing. According to Omokri: “Why would the Nigerian Airforce allow Bola Tinubu land in the Presidential Wing of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport? “That is wrong, almost to the point of treason! It proves that the Buhari government is prepared to use federal might to rig him into power! “Allowing Tinubu land in the Presidential wing is unethical. The man is not the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed forces. “Presidents Obasanjo, Yar’adua and Jonathan never did that. This reduces our Airforce in the estimation of right-thinking members of the public! “Tinubu is a citizen like any other. The Presidential wings of Nigeria’s airports are for the use of the President, and those representing the FG. “Tinubu does not fall into that category. The Nigerian Airforce must not allow itself to become Tinubu and APC’s poodle!”
