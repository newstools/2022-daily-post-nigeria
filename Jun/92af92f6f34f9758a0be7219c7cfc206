The Nigerian government has announced Monday June 13 as a public holiday to mark the 2022 Democracy Day. Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, congratulated Nigerians on the occasion which commemorates the annulled June 12, 1993 presidential election. The poll, won by the late business mogul M.K.O. Abiola, was canceled by the Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida regime. Aregbesola urged citizens to support the President Muhammadu Buhari administration in its efforts at ensuring a united and prosperous nation. The minister told them to reflect on the journey Nigeria has made for the enthronement of a democratic order and the sacrifices of patriots. He urged Nigerians to work toward remaining an indivisible entity as no development can take place in an acrimonious environment. “With the challenges we face in Nigeria today, I see an opportunity for us not to break up or break down, but to break open.” Argegbesola further appealed to the people to appreciate, understand, honour each other and live together in peace.
