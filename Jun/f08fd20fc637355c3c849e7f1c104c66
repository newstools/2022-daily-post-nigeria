The Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the Igbo apex socio-political organization, has reacted to the emergence of Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State as the running mate to the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. Ohanaeze’s Secretary-General, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, described Okowa as a minus to Atiku. In a statement he signed, Isiguzoro said the choice of Okowa would lead to the failure of PDP in the Southeast because Igbos would not vote for Atiku in 2023. Isiguzoro said Okowa’s choice as Atiku’s running mate is a chaotic selection for “a party not ready to win the 2023 elections.” According to Isiguzoro: Okowa is the “reward for a serial betrayal whose inescapable actions will never add national integrity and value to the progress of PDP in 2023, Ifeanyi Okowa is a minus for Atiku, as his choice will decline PDP’s fortunes in Delta and Southern Nigeria. “A man who misled the Southern Governors agenda will never be trusted for the votes of Ndigbo; Igbos will never vote Atiku and Okowa”.
