As politicians jostle to occupy elective offices in the next dispensation, members of the Nigeria Union of Pensioners (NUP), have vowed to mobilise votes for any aspirant that would uphold their interest. President of NUP, Comrade Godwin Abumisi, who spoke to newsmen on Wednesday in Abuja, said gone were the days when politicians would just come and woo senior citizens for elective offices and ignore their plight soon after winning elections. He said the union was still understudying the aspirants with a view to assessing those that would religiously incorporate the payment of pension as and when due into their programmes. According to Abumisi, having such persons who are retirees-friendly in power would guarantee a sense of belonging, respect and improved welfare for our members. The NUP also clamoured for the sustenance of the Pensions Transition Arrangement Directorate (PTAD) because they have a result-oriented policy which has made pension administration easy and hitch free. “We pensioners are keenly and curiously watching the political space and the ongoing aggressive campaigns being embarked upon by the various aspirants vying for different positions under different political parties. “Certainly, the pensioners shall pitch their tent with the presidential/gubernatorial aspirants who are committed and more disposed to their cause and plight by massively casting their votes for them in order to secure their tomorrow. “We are still watching them and for the first time in Nigeria, we are going to make sure anybody who will not be friendly to pensioners in Nigeria is going to fail in the elections. A time has come when the politicians will stop taking us for granted.”
