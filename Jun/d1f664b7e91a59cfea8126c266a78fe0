After spending over two weeks in kidnappers’ den, the abducted Hydroelectric Power Producing Areas Development Commission (HYPPADEC), board member, Alhaji Isah Ozi Salami has finally regained freedom. Salami was kidnapped on the 26th May, 2022, in his country home in Ogaminana Adavi Local Government Area of Kogi State while he was returning from morning prayers at the mosque. The Police Public Relations Officer in Kogi State, SP William Ovye-Aya, confirmed his release to DAILY POST on Thursday evening. According to Aya, Ozi-Salami has since been reunited with his family. He said that the 73-year-old elder statesman was released on Wednesday evening. Aya, who kept silent on whether ransom was paid before the elder statesman was released, said that the abductors abandoned him at a location, from which he found his way home. According to him, the police were still trailing the abductors to bring them to book. DAILY POST recalls that the kidnappers had demanded the sum of N120 million as ransom for them to release the victim.
