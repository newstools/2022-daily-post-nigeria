Amber Heard says she’s heartbroken after her former husband, Johnny Depp won the defamation case against her. She released a statement after the judgement handed down by Fairfax County Court in favour of the American actor on Wednesday. The seven-week trial was followed by millions across the world who had been in solidarity with either party. Heard said her disappointment “is beyond words” as “the mountain of evidence still was not enough to stand up to the disproportionate power, influence, and sway” of Depp. The actress called it a setback and that she was more disappointed with what the verdict means for other women. Heard said her loss also slows the clock to a time when a woman who spoke out could be publicly shamed and humiliated. “It sets back the idea that violence against women is to be taken seriously”, she wrote. Heard believes Johnny’s attorneys succeeded in getting the jury “to overlook the freedom of speech and ignore evidence that was so conclusive that we won in the UK”. “I’m sad I lost this case. But I am sadder still that I seem to have lost a right I thought I had as an American — to speak freely and openly”, the statement added.
