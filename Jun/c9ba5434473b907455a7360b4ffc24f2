The Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) Board, has advocated greater collaboration among stakeholders on the implementation of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy, NACS in the fight against corruption in the country. The NDIC suggested that effective sensitization on the components of NACS, especially the National Ethics & Integrity Policy, and the Freedom of Information Act would improve collaboration in the Federal Government’s anti-corruption campaign among agencies. A statement signed by Bashir Nuhu, the Director, Communication & Public Affairs, NDIC said Mrs Ronke Sokefun the Chairman of the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) Board, made the assertions at a meeting of the Board and Management of the Corporation organised by the National Anti-Corruption Strategy Secretariat. Mrs Sokefun said though the Board and Management of the NDIC have always strived to uphold the core values of integrity and professionalism in the discharge of the NDIC mandate, it would always welcome fresh opportunities to learn how to improve its anti-corruption drive. The NDIC boss was represented at the meeting by the Executive Director, Operations, Mal. Mustapha M. Ibrahim. Ibrahim informed that the policy financial agency to deepen anti-corruption practices necessitated its collaboration with NACS to sensitize its board and management. In a presentation on National Integrity Ethics and Integrity Policy, the Deputy Director, Public Institutions Ethics & Values of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), John Ode hailed the NDIC for taking the anti-corruption sensitization to the board level.
