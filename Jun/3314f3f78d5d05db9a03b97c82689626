The Amalgamated Arewa Youth Group (AAYG), has called for the dissolution of the managements of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authorities (NMDPRA) following the persistent fuel scarcity in Nigeria. A statement issued by the group’s spokesman, Faith Wilson Okon, said, “it is with a saddened heart that the Amalgamated Arewa Youth Group (AAYG) has called for the dissolution of the management of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authorities (NMDPRA) over the recent fuel scarcity in the country.” The group noted that for some months now, Nigerians are passing through untold hardship following the scarcity of petroleum products, adding that essential things, including food items have all gone beyond the reach of the common man in the country. The group lamented that as a result of the persistent scarcity of fuel in the country for the past few months, many people could no longer afford to buy anything in the market, while the government was showing no concern. According to the statement, the disruption in the supply of petroleum products has also caused sudden inflation in the cost of transportation, leading to the increase in the prices of daily consumables. It added that, “the common man is silently suffering in the country, with little or no effort by those in authority to involve measures to ameliorate the plights of its citizens.” The youths noted that following the present hardship Nigerians were going through, they would not fold their hands and watch things get worse. The youths enjoined President Buhari to deal decisively with any Nigerian, no matter how highly placed, that is working against the progress of the country.
