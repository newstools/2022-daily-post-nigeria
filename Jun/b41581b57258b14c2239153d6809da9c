About 200 people were arrested on Saturday in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, for violating the environmental sanitation exercise. “They will be arraigned for immediate prosecution accordingly”, the State Commissioner for Environment, Remilekun Oluwatobi Banigbe, disclosed at the weekend, during the monitoring of the monthly sanitation exercise in the Ilorin metropolis to ascertain the level of compliance. Banigbe noted that everyone as a citizen of the state has a role to play in making sure that the exercise is always a success. She said there are sanitation laws governing the state and should be strictly adhered to. According to Banigbe, “it is the duty of every citizen of the state as an inhabitant to always take total responsiblity of their environment, all we are asking for is to give the Ministry this last Saturday to observe the monthly sanitation for the benefits of individuals and the state at large.” The Commissioner said those apprehended today, Saturday, “will surely be sanctioned according to the law and it will serve as a learning point, let’s take care of the environment instead of constituting public nuisance”, she stated. She lauded the magnanimous efforts of Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq in making the state a safe haven for all and sundry. Banigbe also commended the efforts of the working team for deeming it fit to be part of the exercise while urging them to sustain the support. She urged all Kwarans to always comply with the sanitation laws and the directives of the Ministry of Environment, promising that the Ministry will do all within its disposal to ensure that the state is clean and free of any form of diseases. Banigbe also advised people to desist from dumping their wastes indiscriminately, patronize the commercial waste management contractors and take adequate charge of their environment to live healthy.
