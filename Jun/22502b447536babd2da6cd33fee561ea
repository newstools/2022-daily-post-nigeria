Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, a former Minister for Science and Technology, has questioned the All Progressives Congress (APC) over its failure to zone the 2023 presidency to the South-East. Onu disclosed this on Tuesday at the Eagles Square while delivering his agenda to party delegates just before the commencement of voting at the presidential primary. He asked, “where is the justice,” adding that he sacrificed his presidential ambition in the past just so that two candidates from the South West could run. “What is very, very important, exceptionally important, is that we must ensure that justice is upheld,” Onu said in his address. “Naturally, it should be somebody from the South East that will replace (Buhari), and that will give the opposite South versus North and Christian versus Muslim a balance, and it will bring stability to the nation; it will strengthen Nigeria. “The South West had eight years as president, eight years as vice president; the South South had eight years as president and vice president; where is the justice? Where is the justice?” Dr Onu asked in anguish. “I held the presidential ticket for one of the three parties then, but I had to let it go in order to solve a problem with the South West, to make sure that two Olus contested for the presidency, that head or tail, one will become the president and that brought down tension within the country. “This is what would have happened if we allowed the South East at this time,” Onu bitterly explained.
