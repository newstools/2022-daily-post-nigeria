Former Chelsea forward, Tony Cascarino has backed Chelsea to sign Raheem Sterling from Manchester City this summer. Cascarino said Sterling, who has been linked with a move away from Man City to Chelsea, is a durable player who avoids injury. According to him, the England international can be an upgrade on Christian Pulisic if he decides to move to Stamford Bridge this summer. Speaking to talkSPORT, Cascarino said, “I really thought that Pulisic would be a great player for Chelsea when they got him. I thought he would really be a top player, but it has not quite worked out because of injury. One thing that Raheem has got is that he’s very durable and, touch wood, he avoids injuries, but he’s a very durable player. You can switch him on the right as well so he’s a little bit more versatile as a player.” He added, “For Tuchel, I could see Chelsea attempting to get that type of wide man, absolutely. Why wouldn’t you? His numbers, he creates and he just stretches teams. Pace always stretches teams and if you want to be countering, Raheem is good in counter-attacking teams because he’s so devastating with his pace.”
