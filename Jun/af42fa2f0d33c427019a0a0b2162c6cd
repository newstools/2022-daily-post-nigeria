Arsenal goalkeeper, Bernd Leno, could join Fulham as he looks to leave the Emirates this summer. Aaron Ramsdale’s arrival from Sheffield United last summer saw the German become second-choice. Leno looks likely to leave with Matt Turner set to arrive this summer from New England Revolution. Many expected the 30-year-old to return to his homeland, but that may not be the case. The Athletic report that Fulham are in talks to sign Leno this summer and he is one of their “more favoured candidates”. They also report that the goalkeeper is keen to remain in London.
