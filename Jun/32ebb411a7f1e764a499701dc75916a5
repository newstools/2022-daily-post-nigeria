New Real Madrid signing, Antonio Rudiger has reportedly demanded the transfer of left-back Miguel Gutierrez to avoid a ‘war of egos’ with teammate David Alaba. According to El Nacional, Rudiger has told Real Madrid president Florentino Perez to sell Gutierrez to decrease competition for both him and Alaba. Rudiger apparently wants to avoid an unexpected war of egos inside Real Madrid’s dressing room. The report added that Real Madrid wants Gutierrez, 20, to stay and continue his development, but the left-back is expected to be sold this summer to make room for more signings in the ongoing transfer window. Rudiger recently joined Real Madrid from Chelsea on a free transfer earlier this month. The Germany international, who helped Chelsea lift the UEFA Champions League in 2021, signed a four-year contract with the LaLiga champions. Rudiger, who primarily plies his trade as a left centre-back, will wear the number 22 shirt at Madrid. With the likes of Nacho Fernandez and Eder Militao deputizing at right centre-back, Rudiger will hope to form a robust defensive partnership at Real Madrid. Meanwhile, Alaba is expected to return to left-back – his natural position for both Austria and his former club Bayern Munich Due to a potential shift in Alaba’s position, Ferland Mendy is expected to go down the pecking order and Academy graduate Gutierrez’s future at Santiago Bernabeu will also be up in the air.
