The All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu has distanced himself from a purported 2023 campaign manifesto in circulation. Tinubu said the purported document in circulation was not his 2023 campaign manifesto and was not endorsed by him. He explained that the document was a mere draft proposal and suggestions on the programmes he should implement if elected President. Tinubu’s denial was contained in a statement signed by the Director of Media and Communications, Tinubu Campaign Organisation, Bayo Onanuga on Sunday. He assured that his manifesto would be a more serious document than the one in circulation. Tinubu disclosed that he would present his manifesto to Nigerians when the document is ready. The statement reads partly: “I want to place it on record that the manifesto being circulated via social media platforms and already published by a section of the mainstream media is not the official manifesto of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and APC for the 2023 general elections. “We want to clearly state that the document is an unofficial document and Tinubu cannot be held accountable on any of the issues raised in the document. “The presidential candidate and APC are currently working on an all-embracing manifesto that will inspire the confidence of Nigerians. “When the official policy document of Tinubu is ready, it will be formally presented to Nigerians and our candidate will be in a position to defend every word that will be contained therein.” Last week, Tinubu emerged as the APC presidential candidate after winning the party’s primary election in a landslide victory.
