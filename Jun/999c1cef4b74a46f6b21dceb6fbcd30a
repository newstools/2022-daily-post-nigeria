The Police in Oyo State have condemned the gruesome murder of a traffic personnel on duty at New Garage Area in Challenge, Ibadan, the state capital. The Public Relations Officer, SP Adewale Osifeso, in a statement Friday, said the incident occurred on Thursday at about 2030hrs. The male officer with A/P No. 16860 STW Oluniyi Bamidele was attached to the Challenge Police Divisional Headquarters, Ibadan. The spokesman noted that he was attacked by commercial vehicle (Micra) operators after one of them committed a traffic offence. “Acting on the false alarm raised, his colleagues attacked the deceased and pushed him towards another oncoming commercial vehicle at top-speed.” The police said he was knocked down “before another Micra driver deliberately drove over his helpless body which eventually led to his death at the spot”. The Deputy Commissioner of Police, Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has vowed to arrest “those responsible for the cold-blooded murder”. The command told citizens to go about their lawful businesses without fear of harassment and assist with credible information. Osifeso assured that tactical and other crime prevention teams have been deployed to the area to forestall a breach of peace.
