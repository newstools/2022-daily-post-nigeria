Getafe president, Angel Torres, has claimed they have been offered the chance to sign Gareth Bale on a free transfer. Bale, 32, will leave Real Madrid when his contract expires at the end of June. During his nine years with Los Blancos, the Welshman won five Champions League titles. Bale has been linked with a return to Wales to join Cardiff, but it appears he is keen on playing on in LaLiga. “I spoke with the player’s agent this morning. He has been offered to us. We will consider it. I am going to have to speak to the technical staff,” Torres said according to Sky Sports.
