An Ekiti State High Court sitting in Ado Ekiti, has sentenced a 29-year-old farmer, Owajulu Tobi to 10 years imprisonment without option of fine for offence of rape. One count charge of rape was leveled against the convict before Justice Adeniyi Familoni. The charge reads, “That you, Owajulu Tobi, on 12th of June, 2021, at Ibeji-Eluja in Emure Ekiti, in the Ado Ekiti Judicial Division, did rape a 17-year-old girl, contrary to Section 31(2) of the Child’s Rights Law, Cap. R7, Laws of Ekiti State, 2012.” In her testimony before the court, the victim said, ‘’ I am an apprentice as a hairdresser. On that day, I went to my grandmother’s farm to harvest pepper. In the farm, the convict came to me and demanded water and palm fruits. I told him I did not have water while the palm fruits belonged to my grandmother, thereafter, he left, he later came back and suddenly held me at the back, he covered my mouth with cloth, I was struggling to shout but he overpowered me despite holding a cutlass and raped me in the farm, he also flogged me with cassava stick for wasting his time.” To prove his case, the prosecutor, Taiwo Ajibulu called five witnesses, he also tendered statements of the defendant, medical report, pants, tight and shirts as exhibits. The convict spoke through his counsel, Gbenga Abiola in his own defence, but called no witness. Conclusively, Justice Adeniyi Familoni, in his judgment said, “I hold that the totality of evidence adduced by the prosecution, it has proven the rape of the prosecutrix (Victim) beyond reasonable doubt. The defendant deserves the legal consequence of his misdeed. “However, the court will not impose the maximum punishment for the offence on his misdeeds. “Therefore, the defendant Owajulu Tobi, is hereby sentenced to 10 years imprisonment without any option of fine,’’ he concluded.
