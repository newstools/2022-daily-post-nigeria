Manchester City forward, Raheem Sterling, is keen on signing for Chelsea this summer and has already been asking about Thomas Tuchel and his managerial style, according to The Athletic. It is believed the Blues are closing in on a deal for the player and could even land him for a bargain price of £35million. Sterling only has just a year left on his contract at the Etihad and is facing fresh competition from new boys Erling Haaland and Julian Alvarez. His potential transfer appears to be at an advanced stage, as Sterling has already been talking to people about what life is like at Stamford Bridge. He has been particularly keen to get a gauge on what Tuchel is like as a manager, and will likely have consulted his potential Chelsea team-mates during England’s recent internationals – with Reece James and Mason Mount both part of the squad. Sterling appears to be happy with the feedback he received, with the only remaining stumbling block to a deal being the size of the fee involved.
