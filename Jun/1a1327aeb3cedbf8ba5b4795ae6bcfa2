Premier League new boys, Nottingham Forest have announced the signing of Nigerian forward, Taiwo Awoniyi. Awoniyi linked up with Steve Cooper’s side from Bundesliga club, Union Berlin. The striker scored 25 goals in 61 appearances for the capital club. Nottingham Forest activated the €20m release clause in the forward’s contract to secure his services. Awoniyi is the club’s most expensive signing. The 24-year-old was formerly in the books of Premier League giants, Liverpool but failed to make a single appearance during his five-year association with the club. He joined Union Berlin on a permanent deal last summer.
