Former Aston Villa forward, Gabby Agbonlahor, has hit out at Arsenal defender Ben White, insisting that the England star is overrated. Agbonlahor said White should not start for Arsenal next season, adding that he should be replaced by William Saliba, who has been on loan at Marseille to replace him next season, in the Gunners’ defense next season. According to him, the 24-year-old is not worth the money Arsenal spent on acquiring him last summer from Brighton. “I have watched Saliba a few times and he has got that speed that you like to see in a centre-half and he is very good at making the right decision at the right time,” Agbonlahor told Football Insider. He added: “Arsenal’s defence is nowhere near good enough to get top-four. For me, Ben White is very overrated, I watched him against Newcastle towards the end of the season and he was absolutely dreadful. “He lacks pace, he lacks aggression. Yes, he’s good on the ball, but he is not a defensive midfielder, he is a centre-half. Arsenal needs two centre-halves who are no-nonsense and have both got speed. For me, Gabriel and Saliba would be my starters next season. “With Ben White, I think Brighton are laughing at getting the fee they got for him because he’s not good enough. It’s a shame that Arsenal have wasted a lot of money again. It was the same with Pepe. Ben White was not needed and Saliba should start ahead of him.”
