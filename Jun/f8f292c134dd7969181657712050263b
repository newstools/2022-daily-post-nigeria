The Federal Capital Territory Police Command has reacted to an alarm raised by a Twitter user, Ameerah Sufyan alleging a kidnap incident in the territory. The Tweep, @ameerah_sufyan, had in her tweet, alleged that she and 16 other residents of the city were kidnapped and whisked into a forest. Sufyan alleged that she and other 16 victims, including three pregnant women and two children, were abducted at gunpoint from different parts of Abuja by men in police uniforms. According to the tweet, she had shared her location with her WhatsApp contacts, adding that her captors did not see her phone. Reacting, the FCT command spokesperson, Josephine Adeh said the command has drafted the Tactical and Intelligence apparatus to rescue the victims and uncover those behind the alleged incident. She, however, said there was no reported case of kidnapping in the FCT recently as contained in Sufyan’s tweet. Responding to questions from journalists, the PPRO said, “There was no formal report of any abduction/ kidnapping in The FCT today. Although reports from many online sources tag the case as an alleged kidnapping, this would have to be one of the most unique incidents of its kind. “That a victim has access to her phone to post useful information about her whereabouts remains unconventional to such crime yet a beam of hope for all, the Police inclusive. “The FCT Police Command has since drafted the Tactical and Intelligence apparatus on the case upon the receipt of the information to rescue all involved and get to the root of the matter. “We thank the members of the public for the useful information given and enjoin them to exercise patience and calm while the Police remain on top of the situation”
