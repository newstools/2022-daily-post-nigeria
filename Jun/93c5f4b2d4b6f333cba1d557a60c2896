The Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, is currently in a closed-door meeting with governors elected on the party’s platform. The meeting is coming a few hours after the emergence of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu as the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The meeting is currently being held at the Legacy House Maitama, Abuja. It is expected to be the first in a series of meetings preparatory to the campaigns for the 2023 general elections. Notice of the meeting was signed by the Director-General of the PDP Governors Forum, CID Maduabum. “The presidential candidate of PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, GCON requests a meeting with PDP Governors,” the notice by Maduabum stated. The choice of the running mate to Atiku might top the agenda of the meeting. Some of the governors at the meeting were Bayelsa Governor, Douyi Diri, Rivers Governor Nyesom Wike, Bauchi Governor, Bala Muhammed and Samuel Ortom of Benue State. Others are Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde and his Sokoto counterpart Governor Aminu Tambuwal. Atiku had recently defeated Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers; Bukola Saraki, former senate president; Udom Emmanuel, Akwa Ibom governor; Ayo Fayose, former governor of Ekiti; Bala Mohammed, Bauchi governor, among others, during the party’s presidential primary election. The former vice president had polled 371 votes to clinch the ticket to represent the party in the 2023 elections. The national working committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had last week issued a certificate of return to Atiku.
