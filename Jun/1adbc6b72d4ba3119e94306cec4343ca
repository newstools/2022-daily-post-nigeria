Operatives of the Adamawa State Police Command have arrested three suspects for kidnapping activities. The operatives rescued two victims, according to a press release obtained from the command on Monday which said the operation was conducted at Ngurore Mountain in Gombi Local Government Area on Saturday, June 4. The police gave the names of the suspects as Hammadu Ahmad, 20 years old and Umaru Isa, also 20 years old, both residents of Gada Maisaje, Gombi; as well as Muhammed Bello, 25 years old and a resident of Sabon Gari in Dambo’a Local Government Area of Borno State. The Police indicated, however, that two other suspects fled and efforts were still being made to have them arrested. The three who were arrested are now being detained and are said to have owned up to kidnapping one Yuguda Usman, 11 years old, and Mohammed Mohammed, 65 years old, both residents of Wushubura village, Gombi. “The incident was reported to the police by a good Samaritan who observed their suspicious movements around the mountain,” the police statement said. The statement which was signed by Police Public Relations Officer Suleiman Nguroje added that on the strength of the report, the state Commissioner of Police, CP Sikiru Akande ordered immediate action, following which the DPO Gombi and members of vigilantes acted promptly, arrested the suspects and rescued the victims. “Investigation so far reveals that the syndicate members have been terrorising villages around Gombi and Song Local Government Areas,” the statement said. It added that the police commissioner had directed the O/C of the police crack squad to take over the investigation and ensure the prosecution of the suspects. “He further directs that the two fleeing suspects be traced for possible arrest,” it said.
