The South East Revival Group (SERG) has hailed the “rare patriotic view” of Hakeem Baba-Ahmed on Labour Party (LP) presidential flag bearer, Peter Obi Baba-Ahmed, a former permanent secretary, served as Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) secretary. The Northern Elders Forum (NEF) spokesman recently met Obi whom he commended for his zeal to fix the country. “I wish those who see him as an ethnic candidate can get to know him better. I also wish those who try to sell him will tone down his ethnic identity. “I hope the nation will see the candidates up close, we could see a revolution”, he tweeted. In a statement on Tuesday, SERG coordinator Willy Ezugwu noted that Baba-Ahmed didn’t speak as a politician but a patriot and courageous statesman. “Anyone who thinks otherwise is either a typical politician with vested interest or an ethnic bigot who should not be taken seriously”, he stressed. Ezugwu said citizens, irrespective of political and religious affiliations, have decided to dump the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He noted that no patriotic Nigerian can view Obi’s presidential from an ethnic or religious perspective because the candidate is well loved. SERG said NEF leader, Prof Ango Abdullahi “nailed it” when he declared that neither PDP’s Atiku Abubakar nor APC’s Bola Tinubu can fix Nigeria’s challenges. The statement advised lovers of good governance, rule of law, infrastructure development, national unity, security of lives and property to turn out in large numbers next year.
