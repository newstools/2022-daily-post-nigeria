Former West Ham United star, Frank McAvennie, has picked Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz to shine at Liverpool, claiming the duo could help the club ‘forget’ Sadio Mane. Mane left Liverpool to join Bayern Munich on a three-year deal a few days ago after spending six years at Anfield. Speaking to Football Insider, McAvennie lauded Diaz and Nunez. He said, “Klopp’s not beating about. He brought in Diaz, who’s magnificent. He’s brought Nunez in now, who’s a top striker. Hopefully, the boy can hit the ground running, score goals and make them forget about Mane.” “But what can you say about Mane? He scored all these great goals, and he is so grounded. He was going into the last year of his contract. That is why he went for £35million. If he wasn’t, it would have been an awful lot more than that.” McAvennie added: “It is great for German football because he’s a great addition to any team. He’s been a breath of fresh air to the English game, and that is what you want. I think the Liverpool supporters will applaud him, and he’ll get a great reception if he comes back to Anfield.”
