A Nigerian lady, identified as Martha Uche, has volunteered to donate a kidney to the daughter of Senator Ike Ekweremadu. Recall that the lawmaker’s daughter, Ms. Sonia Ekweremadu, is reportedly down with kidney failure and needs a transplant. The development had triggered both parents to take a young Nigerian to the United Kingdom for organ donation. But they were arrested and detained by the UK authority for allegedly facilitating the travel of the boy said to be a minor. The issue has generated both positive and negative reactions from concerned citizens of the country as many who believe Ekweremad may be innocent, sympathized with the family. However, Martha in the short video currently making the rounds on social media offered to donate her kidney to save Sonia The good Samaritan said in the video that she was ready to donate the organ with no monetary reward. According to her, the plight of Miss Ekweremadu has touched her and she sees her in her dream, hence the need to make the sacrifice. Asked why she offered to donate her kidney, Uche said: “I need to do that because I need to help the girl. She’s dying and they have already shown me in my dream that I should help the girl. I already saw her a long time ago and I saw her again this morning. I need to help her.” “I don’t have any demands for now. I just need to save her life,” she added.
