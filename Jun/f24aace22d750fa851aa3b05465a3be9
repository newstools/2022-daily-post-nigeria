Uche Secondus, former national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has hailed Atiku Abubakar, the party’s presidential candidate, for choosing Ifeanyi Okowa as his running mate. Atiku on Thursday picked Okowa, governor of Delta, as his running mate for the 2023 presidential election. The PDP presidential candidate stated that he chose Okowa because the governor meets “all or most of the qualities” he desires. Nyesom Wike and Emmanuel Udom were also listed as likely choices prior to the announcement. Secondus in a statement by Ike Abonyi, his media aide, noted that the opposition party will be victorious at the polls in 2023 with the duo of Atiku and Okowa. “Alhaji Abubakar is a square peg in a square hole whose pedigree in the nation’s political space remains outstanding and speaks for itself. “Atiku’’s choice of Okowa as his running mate shows his knack for picking a good head to be around him for the gargantuan task ahead. “With the picking of a running mate, the candidacy is complete and PDP is now set for the inevitable journey back to Aso Rock in 2023,” the statement read.
