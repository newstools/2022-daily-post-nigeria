Manchester United forward, Marcus Rashford, has snubbed a move to Tottenham Hotspur, according to the UK Times. The 24-year-old endured a torrid season at Old Trafford, scoring just four times and providing only two assists in the Premier League. Spurs are reportedly keen to sign Rashford in the hope he rediscovers lost form. With one year left on Rashford’s contract, United may have been tempted to cash in on the England international now rather than risk losing him later on a free transfer. However, Rashford has informed the Red Devils he would prefer to fight for his place in the new Erik ten Hag regime than join Tottenham. Ten Hag takes over following a season of turmoil at Old Trafford, which saw the team finish sixth in the league and concede club-record high of 57 goals across the campaign.
