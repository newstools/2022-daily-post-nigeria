The United Nations (UN) has expressed grave concern about the recent waves of terrorist attacks affecting civilians in North-East Nigeria. Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, Matthias Schmale said attacks by non-state armed groups (NSAGs) and communal clashes raise immediate concerns for the safety of civilians. Schmale noted that the situation put at serious risk the capacity of humanitarian aid organizations to securely deliver assistance to vulnerable people. The UN recalled that between June 6 and 9, renewed clashes in Guyuk and Lamurde LGAs in Adamawa claimed over 30 lives, wounded 57 people, and affected 500 homes. The fighting, triggered by disputes over the ownership of farmland, displaced over 10,000 people. On June 7, terrorists killed dozens of people during an attack on Mugdala village, on the outskirts of Dikwa town in Borno. It occurred after the May 24 attack in Mudu village, Dikwa LGA, that killed at least 32 civilians. The victims were internally displaced persons (IDPs) who ventured from Rann LGA to collect scrap metals. Again on May 28, terrorists attacked an IDP camp in Mafa LGA in Borno, looting food and other supplies. The UN warned that major supply routes are under threat as NSAGs target commuter vehicles through illegal vehicle checkpoints. Such was recorded when six trucks carrying food supplies and fuel were set ablaze and civilians abducted on June 6 along the Maiduguri-Damaturu road. The world body said unexploded ordnance (UXO) continues to jeopardize the safety, with one child killed and seven others injured following an explosion at an IDP camp in Ngala LGA on June 2. Schmale, on behalf of the humanitarian community, extended his condolences to the families of the victims and wished those wounded a speedy recovery. “I call on all armed parties to immediately stop the violence and respect international humanitarian law and human rights law and ensure the protection of civilians”, he said.
