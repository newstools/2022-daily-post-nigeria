The gubernatorial candidate of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Plateau State, Barr Caleb Mutfwang, says the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) knows that it will not win the 2023 governorship election in the state. He equally assured party faithful that they will follow the APC bumper to bumper to forestall their rigging mercenary. He also said it was gratifying that there was no “petition or agitation” against his emergence as a candidate of the party, adding that it shows how united the party is going into the upcoming general elections. Mutfwang disclosed this while addressing thousands of party faithful on his return to Jos, from Abuja, after receiving the party’s certificate of return. He said, “I want you to know that APC knows that it will not win the 2023 governorship election unless it rigs, but that will not happen, because we are going to protect our votes; we will follow them bumper to bumper, and by the grace of God our victory will be landslide”, he assured. “Nobody should deceive you that our victory would be stolen; because those who would attempt that act are not yet born; God is with us and by His grace after our victory, there won’t be any petition”, he admonished. He appealed to those who lost in the various primary elections, saying “wherever there was misunderstanding, it would be corrected; we will make sure that we all work as a team. “The umbrella is large, whosoever comes under, we shall move together; so there is no need for any quarrel amongst us”, he admonished. Mutfwang also assured that in no distant time, the party would choose its Deputy Governor, “As I was chosen without any rancour, so shall our Deputy Governor emerge”. Earlier in his remarks, a former Governor of the State, Senator Jonah Jang, thanked party faithful and assured that they would work as a team to ensure the party wins the governorship polls and the presidential elections come 2023.
