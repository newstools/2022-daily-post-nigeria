Residents in the border town of Mfum town in central Cross River State near Cameroon are currently dealing with threats to their lives after the skirmish which erupted and claimed lives and properties. The violence took place on Thursday and Friday, claiming properties and some lives, including one Ebri. The violence was allegedly targeted at security personnel at the border point at Mfum. It was not confirmed if any security personnel lost their lives during the violence but as the fear of carrying out their normal daily businesses at the border increases, the chairman of Etung LGA, John Nkom Etuk visited the troubled border yesterday. Addressing the residents, business people at the border and security officials, Etuk condemned the violence. He described it as unfortunate and expressed regret over the loss of lives and destruction of properties. He said Etung is known for her peaceful nature, maintaining that since he assumed office he has initiated various approaches and provided the necessary support for the sustenance of peace in the area. “Government will not tolerate any acts of lawlessness. We need peace. We need calm and restraint while the issues involved will speedily be addressed. “I sympathize with the family of Late Ebri who lost his life in the course of the violent skirmishes and the destroyed properties.”
