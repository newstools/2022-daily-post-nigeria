Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu has confirmed the dip in electricity generation. The situation affects some states in Nigeria as generation dipped to below 1,940MW from 3,647MW recorded earlier in the week. In a statement on Saturday, Aliyu explained that the cause was the partial shutdown of the Oben gas plant. This is to address the repair of critical gas processing equipment, his spokesman Isa Sanusi noted. The government said the incident occurred when other power plants on other gas sources were undergoing planned maintenance and capacity testing. “We wish to notify the public that Seplat Energy Plc has mobilized equipment, material and personnel to site with a view to expediting the restoration of normal gas supply to the affected power plants.” The statement said there are assurances that the repair work would be concluded this weekend and normalcy will be restored. The minister appealed to electricity consumers to endure the current state of supply. Aliyu assured that efforts are being made for a sustained improvement of supply across the country.
