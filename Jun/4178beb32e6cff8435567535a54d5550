Former Tottenham Hotspur star, Darren Bent, has urged Manchester United manager, Erik Ten Hag, to replace Harry Maguire as captain with goalkeeper David de Gea this summer. There are question marks over whether Maguire will even be the first choice at Old Trafford next season under Ten Hag after a disappointing campaign. But Bent believes De Gea is the only player that should take the captain’s armband from Maguire, insisting that Ronaldo’s behaviour on the field last season rules him out. Speaking on talkSPORT, Bent said: “I think that David De Gea should be the captain. “My only thing with Ronaldo is, we know he is a leader, but he tried to lead this season and not many of the players followed him. Some of them went the other way. “None of them improved, none of them wanted to follow the example that he set and we know that he is one of the greats, but there were times when people didn’t pass the ball to him and he would turn his back on them and throw his arms up in the air. “That is not a captain. He was a captain this season without having the armband, but for me, David De Gea would be my captain.”
