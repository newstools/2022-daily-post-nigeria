Real Madrid president, Florentino Perez, has claimed Kylian Mbappe will “already be sorry” after refusing to join the club this summer. Mbappe chose to remain at Paris Saint-Germain, where he has signed a three-year contract extension. The France forward was heavily tipped to join Madrid as a free agent but opted to continue with the Ligue 1 champions. It was a decision that did not go down well in the Spanish capital, where there was a sense that Real Madrid had been misled by the player. Perez has now been caught on camera telling a Madrid supporter, for whom he was signing an autograph, on Mbappe: “Poor man, he will already be sorry”. The Madrid chief uttered the words after a fan told him: “Do not sign Mbappe now.”
