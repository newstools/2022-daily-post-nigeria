Former Chelsea star, Tony Cascarino, has predicted the fate of Manchester United captain, Harry Maguire, under new manager, Erik ten Hag next season. Cascarino believes Maguire may never get to play for Manchester United under Ten Hag, adding that the England defender might be the scapegoat during the Dutchman’s regime at Old Trafford. According to him, Maguire’s position in the England team will be under threat if Ten Hag decides not to keep him as his preferred defender at Man United. Maguire has been on the receiving end of criticism from football pundits and Manchester United fans for his below-par performances as captain and leader of the defenders in recent weeks. Speaking on the Weekend Sports Breakfast, Cascarino told talkSPORT: “I think his career’s going to change slightly in the next year because with Erik ten Hag coming in at Man United, what does he think of Harry Maguire? You might have a scenario where he plays really well for England, gets to the start of the season and then doesn’t play under Ten Hag for Man United. “What does Gareth Southgate do then? That’s a possible scenario. It’s not unlikely because there’s going to be a lot of scapegoats after what’s happened at United over the last year. Last season was dreadful and there’ll be scapegoats and Harry Maguire might be one of them. Ten Hag might go down the road of saying, ‘he’s not for me’. That sometimes happens in club football.”
