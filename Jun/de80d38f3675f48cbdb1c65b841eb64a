Former Liverpool player, Dean Saunders, has slammed Chelsea co-owner Todd Boehly for the way he has been running the football club since buying it from Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich. Saunders said that Boehly was acting like he was playing Football Manager in real life. This comes after Chairman Bruce Buck, Director Marina Granovskaia and technical advisor Petr Cech left Chelsea following Boehly’s takeover of the West London club. In the wake of Buck’s departure, Boehly named himself chairman, something that Saunders was not happy about. Speaking with talkSPORT, Saunders hit out at the American. He said, “I might be going in a bit early on this one. I mean [Boehly] has bought the club for £3 billion, why would you put yourself in the hot-seat? Is he playing Football Manager? “Some of the owners have got a Football Manager at home. They sit in the lounge with their children, and the best part of Football Manager is you buy the players, you pick the team and you sell the players and do the tactics. “And then you come up with this idea, ‘why don’t we do it properly and buy a real football club?’ And then they try to play Football Manager with a real football club.”
