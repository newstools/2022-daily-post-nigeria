Gunmen have killed two local hunters serving as community guards in Adamawa State capital, Yola. The gunmen also abducted a private security guard in the course of their operation. DAILY POST gathered Wednesday evening that the incident took place in the early hours of Wednesday along Barracks Road, Jimeta, Yola. Barracks Road is a famous district in Yola named after a military facility, the 23 Armoured Brigade, located in the area. The deceased hunters are Abdullahi Maikano, described as a veteran of Boko Haram war, and his associate identified simply as doctor. A source who pleaded anonymity said, “All our members are in a sober mood today following the gruesome killing of two of our operatives. The trend has become disturbing. Barracks Road neighborhood has in recent times become notorious for the activities of deadly marauders.” Another source, speaking glowingly of the late Abdullahi Maikano, said, “I received the death of Abdullahi Maikano with shock and disbelief. Right now, my spirit is very low because if a valiant warrior who fought Boko Haram for two good years can be cut short in this brutal manner, then, no one is safe.” Spokesman of the Nigeria Police in Adamawa State, SP Suleiman Nguroje, said the police command had deployed an anti-kidnapping squad to rescue the abducted security operative and to round up the culprits.
