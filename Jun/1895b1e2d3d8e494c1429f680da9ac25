The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has declared a couple, Onyinmiebi (Miebi Baraza) and Beatrice Bribena, wanted. An alert by the anti-graft agency urged persons with information about them to contact any of its offices across Nigeria. The agency is searching for the duo over alleged fraud to the tune N2billion. The Bribenas are the promoters of Baraza Multipurpose Cooperative Society Limited. “We are dedicated to improving members’ lives via financial empowerment, business financing, thrift & credit, housing, scholarship, etc”, its profile reads. Bribena, a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain in Bayelsa State, is pastor at Christ Embassy Church. He is accused of scamming thousands of billions of naira after promising a 25 percent Return on Investment (ROI) monthly. In 2021, the victims repeatedly visited the company’s headquarters on Otiotio Road in Yenagoa to seek a refund. The EFCC has sealed the building. The company also has branches in Port-Harcourt, the Rivers capital, and some other parts of the country. Baraza had informed investors it was trading with their money on forex platforms but stopped after it could no longer pay returns. Last July, Bribena released a video to debunk speculations that his health and business were failing. “Ignore such news. If I did not faint since, is it now that I will faint? I don’t know whether some people are angry that Baraza could bounce back”, he said.
