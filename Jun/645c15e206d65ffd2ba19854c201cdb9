Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Yakubu Ajaka, has said that the former Governor of Anambra State and the presidential candidate of Labour Party, Peter Obi should be allowed to enjoy his sectional sympathy and social media frenzy for now. He said that when political campaigns start, Nigerians would differentiate between boys and men in politics. Speaking with journalists on Sunday in Abuja, Ajaka also said that the former governor of Kano State, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso cannot become the president of Nigeria with a sectional party like New Nigerian Peoples Party (NNPP). He said, “Just like Kwankwaso, Peter Obi is only enjoying sectional sympathy but a real presidential candidate needs to enjoy acceptability from all parts of the country. “So, we believe that Peter Obi should enjoy his social media frenzy for now before the real campaign starts very soon.” The APC chieftain noted that Kwankwaso, who is the presidential candidate of NNPP should return to the ruling party, where he can have a great chance of becoming president in the future. He stressed that winning one or two states in the North-West won’t make him the president. He stated: “Kwankwaso knew about the formation of APC, he contributed immensely to its success in 2015 and our leaders hope to repay him at the appropriate time but he cannot be outside to be a beneficiary in the nearest future. “So, that is why I said it’s not too late for him to return to the APC. That’s where he naturally belongs and has an assurance of becoming a president one day, and not his current sectional NNPP. “Although, some people might be deceiving him by calling him Mr. President already, but just one or two states in the North-West can’t make him a president. Kwankwaso needs a national party like APC to achieve his presidential ambition. So, I urged him to do the needful before it’s too late,” Ajaka said.
