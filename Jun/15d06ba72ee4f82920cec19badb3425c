Manchester United forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, has sent a message to his boyhood club Sporting Lisbon, congratulating them on the 20th anniversary of their Academy. Ronaldo, whom the Academy is named after, expressed his desire to visit the Portuguese club soon. Sporting Lisbon renamed their Academy after Ronaldo in September 2020, honouring the former Juventus and Real Madrid star for his unmatched legacy. On Tuesday, Ronaldo dedicated a heartwarming video message to Sporting Lisbon, which the club shared via Twitter. Below is what Ronaldo had to say (translated by A Z): “Congratulations on the 20th anniversary of the opening of the Academy, for all the goals you have achieved, and for all the success you have achieved. It is a great honour to have the Academy bear my name, and I hope to see you soon.” Ronaldo, 37, joined Sporting Lisbon’s Academy at the tender age of 12. The five-time Ballon d’Or winner made his first-team debut for the club five years later in October 2002 against Braga. The Portugal captain left Sporting in August 2003 to join Manchester United for £12.24 million.
