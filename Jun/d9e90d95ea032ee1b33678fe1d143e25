The Ohanaeze Ndigbo has cautioned President Muhammadu Buhari to consider the southeast presidency to avert a possible fallout at the All Progressives Congress, APC, primaries. Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, the Secretary-General of Ohanaeze, said Buhari should remember his conversation with the late Biafra warlord, Odumegu Ojukwu, and consider a southeast Presidency. Isiguzoro said choosing a candidate who might not be a solution to the threats against the unity of the country should be discarded. In a statement he signed, Isiguzoro said Ohanaeze made the call after a series of meetings held with relevant stakeholders in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, on Sunday evening. The statement reads: “In search of unity of the country, APC should consider Southeast, we can not afford to play into the hands of Biafra agitators, President Buhari should remember the conversation he had with the Igbo legend, Dim Odumegwu Ojukwu and consider southeast Presidency. “We are looking forward to the President standing firm and saving the unity of the country is of paramount importance, we are optimistic that considering the Southeast will save Nigeria from chaos as there are ongoing silent wars in the Southeast. “We cannot guarantee peace, especially if we play into the hands of the proponents of Biafra agitation, only a wise decision will save the country’s unity. “APC should opt for a consensus rather than a fierce contest to avert implosion and strengthen internal Democracy in the ruling party” Ndigbo urges the President to use the strategy for the emergency of APC National Chairman Senator Adamu to resolve the tensions and anxiety associated with APC primaries and do the needful, what is needed now is the consideration of security implications if southeast Presidency is not achieved in APC, the conspiracy against the Southeast with a wrong choice will spell doom for Nigeria.”
