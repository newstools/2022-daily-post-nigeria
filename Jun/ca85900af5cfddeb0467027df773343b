Kolapo Alimi, a former aide of Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola has stated the reason he defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Alimi who served as commissioner in Osun State for eight years under the administration of Aregbesola said he left the ruling All Progressives Party (APC) because he did not benefit from the current administration. He said Governor Gboyega Oyetola will lose in the coming election in the state because he has divided the party. Speaking during his official defection to the PDP in Osogbo on Wednesday, Alimi claimed Oyetola alienated those who are loyal to the Aregbesola and those who worked for his emergence in 2018. “Oyetola of the APC will lose in this state. There is no amount of power or threat that can save him. He has come and has divided the party, those people who actually worked for him, he made sure he alienated them. “Aregbesola is a member of the APC. He definitely cannot be in support but we have been alienated because of our loyalty to Aregbesola. You cannot get any benefit from the Oyetola government, no matter your contribution. We cannot continue to do that, that’s why we move out.” “He (Oyetola) usually say he would use the red carpet to the government house that why he doesn’t know the value of that office and how to protect it, today his stay in the government house are numbered”
