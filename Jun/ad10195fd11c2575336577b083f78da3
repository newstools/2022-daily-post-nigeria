Famous Nigerian Gospel artiste, Frank Edwards has revealed the treatment Nigerian youths will give Peter Obi, the Presidential candidate of Labour Party if he decides to step down. Edwards, on Thursday, took to his official Instagram page sharing a clip from a movie that Mike Ezuruonye starred in. In the video, Mike, who was a Reverend Father, declined to rule his native kingdom owing to his ministry, but the elders didn’t agree with him. The elders forcefully put the royal garment on him, gave him the mantle of authority, and began hailing him as their king, while Mike Ezuruonye was still objecting. Captioning the video, he wrote: “I think this is what the youths might do to Peter Obi if he ever thinks of stepping down.”
