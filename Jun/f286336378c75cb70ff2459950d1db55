France striker, Alexandre Lacazette has completed his emotional return to Lyon, leaving Arsenal for a three-year deal. Lyon holds a special place in Lacazette’s heart, having first arrived at the club in 2003 as a starry eyed 12-year-old. Lacazette moved to Arsenal in a £53million deal back in 2017 but brought his five-year spell at the North London club to an end by running down his contract, allowing him to return home to Lyon on a free. Lyon is the only club other than Arsenal that Lacazette has played for in his professional career and he has been training with them since choosing not to extend his contract with the Gunners. In unveiling their returning player, Lyon released a 71-second video via Twitter on Thursday, which shows Lacazette walking into the dressing room to pull on the shirt once more, before walking out onto the pitch at the Groupama Stadium. Lacazette stands fourth in Lyon’s all-time scoring charts, having netted 129 goals in 275 matches. He is behind Fleury Di Nallo, Bernard Lacombe and Serge Chies.
