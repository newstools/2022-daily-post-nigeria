Katsina State Governor, Aminu Bello Masari has challenged the newly-elected local government executives in the state to stop running to cities for fear of bandits, urging them to stay in their domains and end the menace of the hoodlums. Masari noted that the council leaders were aware of the challenges in the LGAs before presenting themselves to lead people of the area. He urged the council leaders to use the opportunity given to them for the benefit of the people and in turn to benefit themselves politically, going upward. The Katsina Governor made the remark on Wednesday at a security sensitisation workshop organized for newly-elected Local Governments Council officials in Katsina. He said: “You presented yourselves as chairmen and councillors bearing in mind the huge responsibilities attached to your offices. “We know that we are in a very challenging time but what is leadership without challenges? From the little resources that we have locally, if you are determined to work, you can use it to the benefit of your people. “You must stay in your Local Government. The least you can do for your people is to let them see that you share in their sorrow and grief. “When something happens in your Local Government and you are called upon, stop saying you are in Abuja, Kano or nowhere to be found. “Let us face our challenges head-on because nobody will do it for us.”
