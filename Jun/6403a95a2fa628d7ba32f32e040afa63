Bandits operating in Zamfara State have again stormed Mada community in Gusau Local Government Area of the State, killing one local and abducting six others. DAILY POST gathered that the terrorists who are roaring like wounded lions stormed Mada district of Gusau, the State capital, and started shooting sporadically, putting everyone on the run. According to one Abubakar Mada, there is a police outpost in Mada district but they are not doing anything to secure the lives and properties of the people in the district. “The police operatives there do not have gun for self-defense let alone defending another person,” he lamented. Speaking further, he lamented that it was only God that is saving the situation because the criminal elements want to wipe out Zamfara State. “The way these bandits are operating mercilessly is questionable because nobody can exactly say where they are getting their sophisticated weapons with which the operate. “Their weapons are more sophisticated than the outdated weapons that our military and security operatives are operating with. “Even the military operatives and other security operatives are afraid of confronting the bandits who they know have sophisticated weapons at their disposal. “These terrorists have successfully sacked many communities in the State and the military and security operatives are very much aware of this but they are helpless,” he alleged. DAILY POST reports that with the sad scenario of kidnapping of over 80 persons in various locations of the State just in a few days, the security agencies have not made any official statement regarding the ugly situation that had taken over the entire State in recent times.
