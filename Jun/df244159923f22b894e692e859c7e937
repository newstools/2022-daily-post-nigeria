Governor of Anambra State, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo has described democracy as continuous struggle for a better society. Soludo, who spoke during a special mass at the Anambra Governor’s Lodge in Amawbia, in celebration of Democracy Day stated that it is not only so in Nigeria, but all over the world, as democracy is the only form of government that guarantees a better society. Soludo said: “Nation building is a consequence of struggle for class, both social and otherwise, and values such as focus, determination and perseverance are indispensable in this kind of struggle. “There is no perfect society anywhere in the world, however, contestations and contradictions bring out the best in the society. “Today as Nigeria celebrates Democracy Day, the sacrifices by the late MKO Abiola and others, in the course of the struggle that gave rise to the Democracy Day celebration will not be taken for granted.” The Governor said for Anambra, democracy will remain a struggle to build a liveable and prosperous homeland, where every one will feel safe in, while urging that everybody has a very fundamental role to play in bringing it to fruition.
