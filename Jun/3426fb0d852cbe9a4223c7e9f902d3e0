A joint task force commander and a resident of Sabon Gero community, New Millennium City Settlement, in the Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna State were killed when bandits stormed the area on Tuesday. The invasion of the bandits in the community also led to the abduction of a medical doctor and 16 others. A source told DAILY POST that the bandits came to the community around 10pm on motorcycles, shooting sporadically, scaring the residents before abducting their victims. According to the source, the late JTF commander opened fire on sighting the bandits not knowing that the bandits had closed in on his team. He added, “The bandits opened fire and hit the commander in his legs and he fell. They then shot him in the head, shattering his skull. A resident, who was hit by bullets, died on his way to a hospital.” The source explained that the remains of the commander were later buried in accordance with Islamic rites. According to the source, the situation would have been worse but for the quick intervention of neighbouring communities, who mobilised and chased away the bandits. The Deputy Superintendent of Police, Mohammed Jalige, the State Police Public Relations Officer could not respond to a call put on his phone to confirm the incident.
