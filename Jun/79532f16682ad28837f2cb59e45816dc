Cristiano Ronaldo has thanked fans for their support throughout a “very difficult” campaign, after they voted him Manchester United Player of the Season. The 37-year-old was awarded with the now-named Sir Matt Busby award after scoring 24 goals in 38 games across all competitions for United last season. The Portugal captain also finished as the third-highest scorer in the Premier League (18), behind Son Heung-min and Mohamed Salah, who netted 23 each. However, the Red Devils ended the campaign with their lowest ever Premier League points tally. Reflecting to his latest accolades on Instagram, Ronaldo said: “Thanks to all the fans who voted for me. I couldn’t be more proud of winning the Sir Matt Busby Award in my comeback year to Old Trafford and to the Premier League. “This award goes to all the supporters who’ve never let us down during a very difficult season. Thank you so much for always being on our side and for helping us get Man. United back on track. We know we can count on you.”
