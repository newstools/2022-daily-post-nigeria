Italian side, Lazio is concluding plans to land Chelsea left back, Emerson Palmieri this summer. The 27-year-old, who joined Chelsea from Roma in 2018, has failed to make a mark at the west London side and spent last season on loan at Lyon. Now with just one year left on his contract, Chelsea have the opportunity to sell him this summer as they look to freshen up their defensive options. And Corriere dello Sport reports that the Brazilian-born Italy international is a target for Lazio, with the Serie A side’s manager, Maurizio Sarri wanting to reunite with his former player. According to the report, the Blues want over £12million for the defender and he may need to take a pay cut to secure a move. Sarri worked with Emerson during his time in charge of the west London club three years ago. In the past two seasons, the full-back has made just 16 appearances for Chelsea, having fallen out-of-favour under Thomas Tuchel. The west Londoners already have enough strength in depth at left-back, with Ben Chilwell and Marcos Alonso to choose from.
