Chelsea have edged closer to completing the signing of Sevilla’s Jules Kounde this summer. Kounde has been heavily linked with the Blues since last summer. According to Marca, the French defender has agreed on personal terms on a five-year contract with the Premier League giants. Sevilla are believed to be seeking a fee in the region of £52 million for their 23-year-old player. Kounde joined Sevilla from Bordeaux back in 2019. He immediately became a regular starter for the LaLiga giants and helped them win the Europa League during his debut season. His impressive performances during the 2020-2021 campaign earned him a place in Didier Deschamps’ France squad for Euro 2020 last summer.
