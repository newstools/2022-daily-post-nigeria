Former Inter Milan and Real Madrid midfielder, Wesley Sneijder, has given his verdict on Paris Saint-Germain’s Lionel Messi and Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo. Sneijder said both Messi and Ronaldo made sacrifices, adding that he could have been as good as both the Ballon d’Or winners. Speaking with Gianluca di Marzio, Sneijder claimed he could have been in the best in the world discussion with Messi and Ronaldo, but he chose not to. According to him, he liked to have a drink with his dinner and enjoy life. He said, “I could have become like Messi or Ronaldo. I simply didn’t feel like it. I enjoyed my life, maybe I had a glass [of wine] at dinner. Leo and Cristiano are different, they have made many sacrifices. And that’s fine with me, my career, however, was still amazing.” Sneijder challenged Messi and Ronaldo for the Ballon d’Or in 2010.
