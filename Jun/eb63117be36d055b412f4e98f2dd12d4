Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State on Friday said the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, was at the official residence of President Muhammadu Buhari, inside the Presidential Villa, Abuja, on Thursday, on an “appreciation visit”. Sanwo-Olu, who accompanied Tinubu to the Villa, disclosed this on his Twitter account on Friday. Thursday evening’s visit was the first after Tinubu scored 1,271 votes to clinch the APC’s presidential ticket on Wednesday. However, Sanwo-Olu said the visit became imperative following Buhari’s non-interference in the APC’s special convention and presidential primary that produced Tinubu as the party’s 2023 presidential flagbearer. According to him, Tinubu and his entourage appreciated the President for giving all aspirants a level playing field. Sharing pictures of the visit on his Twitter account, Samwo-Olu said, “I accompanied our leader, and APC Presidential flag bearer, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu on an appreciation visit to His Excellency, President Muhammad Buhari. “We deeply thank him for giving all aspirants a level playing field without interference. “He also gave the party members an opportunity to make a choice of who their flag bearer should be, without hindrance. “This is a rare attribute, and should be celebrated. “Therefore, we celebrate you Your Excellency, President Muhammad Buhari “We also paid a visit to His Excellency, V.P. Prof. Yemi Osinbajo. “The project called Nigeria is a collective task. All hands will be on deck as we embark on this journey. “There are no victors nor losers, we’re all winners and project managers, if we want to give the best to the citizens, and turn around the fortune of our dear country. “I salute His Excellency, Prof Yemi Osinbajo for his magnanimity and spirit of sportsmanship.”
