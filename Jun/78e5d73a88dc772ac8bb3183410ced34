Barcelona have made a promise to Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah in a bid to lure the Egyptian to Nou Camp. Salah enjoyed another spectacular season with Liverpool, helping the Reds win a domestic cup double and reached the Champions League final. The Egyptian found the net 33 times in all competitions he played both for Liverpool and his national team. The future of the winger, who has spent five years at Anfield, is the subject of intense speculation and his refusal to pen a new deal has only added to the conjecture. According to The Mirror, Barcelona have promised to sign Salah as a free agent should he see out the remaining 12 months of his contract. Robert Lewandowski is also due to join the Catalan giants from Bayern Munich in the next month.
