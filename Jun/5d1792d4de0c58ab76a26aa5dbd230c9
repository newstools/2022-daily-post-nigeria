Former West Ham United forward, Frank McAvennie, has urged Liverpool to sell superstar forward Mohamed Salah if he doesn’t sign a new deal at Anfield. McAvennie believes it is all about money, adding that Salah came out of nowhere and made it at Liverpool. Salah is yet to sign a new contract with Liverpool and his current deal will expire in the summer of 2023. “If he is not staying, you have to sell him. I think that would be right. “He came out of nowhere and made his name at Liverpool. He has won a lot of medals, and he has done brilliantly for Liverpool. “But if he is to go, surely he would think ‘I want to give them a bit of money.'” McAvennie told Football Insider. He added: “Obviously, this is all about money because he isn’t taking the pay rise. it’s crazy, I don’t get all of this. It’s going to be a hard year for him if he runs his contract down.”
