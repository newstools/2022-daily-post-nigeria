Peter Obi, Labour Party presidential candidate has finally reacted to the statement by Spiritual Director of Adoration Ministry Enugu Nigeria, Rev Fr Ejike Mbaka that he is stingy and will never be Nigeria’s President. DAILY POST had reported that worshippers on Sunday protested at the Adoration Ministry over sanction on Fr Mbaka by the Catholic authority. Mbaka was sanctioned and services at the Adoration Ministry were suspended till further notice over his political statement. Following the outrage, Mbaka apologized to Obi and the Catholic Church for his outburst. Speaking in a viral video on Monday, Peter Obi said that Mbaka remains his priest and father in faith and he respects the cleric. The former Governor noted that if he attended the service where Mbaka made the declaration, he would have told him to pray for him to overcome the vision he saw. “For me, Father Mbaka is an ordained priest of God and as a priest, he remains my priest. I will always respect and show my allegiance to the church. Whatever he says, I will take it because he’s my father in faith. I respect him and he’s my brother. “Whenever he says something wrong, I pray over it, if he says something right, I pray over it. Mine is prayers, whatever he does I love him. I don’t have any problem with him. “If he says I am not going to be voted for because I don’t have money, I will pray that God will make those collecting money to vote to see reasons they should not do that. “In fact, if I was there, I would have told him to pray for me to overcome it. I have met pastors who tell me things and I say since you have seen it let us pray that it doesn’t happen.”
