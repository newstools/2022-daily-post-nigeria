The trial of the convicted kidnap kingpin, Chukwudimeme Onwuamadike, alias Evans, charged with the attempted kidnap, was on Friday stalled because of a fire incident which affected his transportation to an Ikeja Special Offences Court. Evans is standing trial alongside Joseph Emeka for the attempted kidnap of the chairman of Young Shall Grow Motors, Chief Vincent Obianodo. NAN reports that the court had on June 15 fixed Friday to hear the evidence of Obianodo through zoom. At the beginning of proceedings today, Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo revealed that there was a fire incident which affected the transportation of the defendants. “I was informed by the Officer in Charge of legal (OC) that there was a fire incident which affected the transportation of the defendants,” the judge said. “For security reasons, the defendants can not be present in court.” Oluwatoyin, however, adjourned the case until July 25 for trial.
