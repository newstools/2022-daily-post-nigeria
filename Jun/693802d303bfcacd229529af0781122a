Ahead of the 2023 general elections, Yohanna Margif has clinched the Labour Party (LP) gubernatorial ticket to fly the party’s flag in Plateau State. DAILY POST recalls that Margif a member of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Plateau State had purchased the APC governorship nomination and expression of interest form but dumped the party before its primary elections, citing a case of imposition. He eventually pitched his tent with the Labour Party. However, at the LP primary election, which had a total the 85 delegates, 5 each from the 17 LGA of the state unanimously affirmed Margif as the candidate in the presence of INEC officials, security personnel, media and party faithful. National Chairman of the Party, Julius Abure who conducted the primary election said the Labour Party is the party that will liberate the masses from the poverty that the APC and PDP brought to Nigerians. The chairman who was represented by Joseph Ndirang noted that the manifesto of the Labour Party is to present “credible and quality” candidates during the general elections that will focus on education, health, security, economy and the welfare of Nigerian workers. Abure who was also the Electoral Officer in charge of conducting the governorship primary election in the state, declared Margif as the elected candidate to fly the party’s flag in 2023. Responding, Margif said he is convinced that he will be the next Governor of the State, after Lalong, saying the party will work together to ensure it emerges victorious come 2023. According to him, “I put myself to the task knowing fully well that the foundation laid by our founding fathers must never be destroyed but built upon”. In her address, the Chairman of the Labour Party in the State, Mrs Grace Zamfara, said they will work together with the Plateau people to ensure that the candidate is elected as governor come 2023.
