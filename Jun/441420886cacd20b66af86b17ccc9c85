Golden Eaglets’ head coach, Nduka Ugbade, says his players are battle-ready for the final of the WAFU B-17 Championship against Burkina Faso on Friday. The Eaglets rallied back from a goal down to beat Cote d’Ivoire 3-1 in the semi-final on Tuesday night. The Nigerian boys also booked a spot at the Africa U-17 Cup of Nations slated for Algeria in 2023 following the win. Burkina Faso on the other hand hosts Ghana 1-0 to secure a place in the final. The Young Etalons just like the Golden Eaglets are unbeaten in the competition. “We are going into the final match, and we are up against Burkina Faso, a team that has won all its four matches in this competition, “Ugbade told thenff.com. “We have also won our three matches here but we must win the fourth and final one to clinch the trophy. “Let us not allow Burkina Faso to play five matches and win all five matches. We must work assiduously to win all our four matches here to be the only undefeated team of the tournament.” The game is scheduled for the Cape Coast Stadium. Kick-off is 6.30pm Ghana time (7.30pm Nigeria time)
