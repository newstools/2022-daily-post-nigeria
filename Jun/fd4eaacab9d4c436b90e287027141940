Students of the Federal Polytechnic, Offa, (FEDPOFFA) have shut the gates of the institution’s permanent site over lack of water in school hostels. DAILY POST reports that the students were protesting the lack of water in school hostels, poor power supply, late release of the list of OND graduating students, and inadequate sport facilities, among other pressing issues in the school. Students’ Union Government President, Comrade Comrade Samuel Orisaniyi on Monday, said the action is “for the betterment of the students.” While urging the students to come out to display solidarity, the SUG, however, warned the students to shun every form of violence and maintain peaceful protest.
