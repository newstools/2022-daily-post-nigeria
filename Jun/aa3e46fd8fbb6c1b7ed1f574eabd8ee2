Liverpool has set a price tag for their forward Sadio Mane amid interest from Bayern Munich. The Reds rejected Bayern Munich’s second bid of around £30million for Mane, with the Premier League giants determined to hold out for a fee closer to £42.5million for the Senegalese international. Mane has privately made clear his intention to leave Anfield after six years at Liverpool. The 30-year-old has just a year to run on his current deal with Liverpool, and Bayern Munich is believed to be his preferred destination. According to the Daily Mail, the Bundesliga champions are set to submit a second bid for Mane after having an initial offer of £25million turned down by Liverpool. However, Bayern are only willing to stretch to around £30million and Jurgen Klopp’s side will not accept the offer. Liverpool feel their asking price is fair for a player that scored 23 goals last season and has shown little depreciation in his energy levels since turning 30.
