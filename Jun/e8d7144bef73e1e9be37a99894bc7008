A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP), Umar Nuhu Gusau has lamented that banditry activities in Zamfara State have forced villagers to desert their communities and migrate to urban areas for begging. Gusau explained that most of the villagers have no other business than farming, saying that since the bandits have taken over almost all the communities in the states, they have abandoned their communities and farmlands. Speaking with DAILY POST in Gusau, the State capital, the PDP chieftain maintained that the terrorists have occupied their farmlands making them jobless as if they have no government in the state. “There are thousands of widows whose husbands have been killed by the rampaging bandits which resulted in the influx of villagers to the urban areas to survive because of the banditry activities. He said farming activities no longer thrive in the state because the bandits have taken total control of the rural areas in the state and can unleash terror attacks whenever they wish and wherever they want without any interruption. He lamented that Governor Matawalle worsened the whole case when he publicly declared that Almajeris rejected in other states should come to Zamfara, stressing that the Governor did not make any provision for their feeding and maintenance. “When young orphans have no means of livelihood, they would be enticed into joining evil societies to make ends meet. We have heard of children less than 10 years old caught in banditry activities” When asked to comment on the efforts of both the federal and state governments towards addressing the long-dominated banditry activities in the State, Gusau said that if the governments were serious, the ugly situation would have been reduced drastically.
