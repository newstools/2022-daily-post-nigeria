The presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso, has confirmed he is in talks with his Labour Party counterpart, Peter Obi. Kwankwaso and Obi are exploring the possibility of cooperation in the 2023 elections, in terms of a possible merger between NNPP and LP. He made the remarks in an interview with BBC Hausa. Kwankwaso said: “We are really talking to Peter Obi, or at least saying that the committee is working to look into the matter (and cooperate with him), and friends and family are coming to talk to us about it.” He noted that their collaboration was especially important as the All Progressives (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had not fielded an Igbo vice-presidential candidate. On Friday, Obi named former presidential spokesman, Doyin Okupe, as his running mate.
