Liverpool legend, Jamie Carragher has named the three players that will lead the club’s attack line next season following the arrival of Darwin Nunez at Anfield from Benfica this summer. Liverpool had an impressive 2021/22 season in which they participated in every possible fixture, challenging for an unprecedented quadruple. The Reds finished the campaign by winning the Carabao Cup and the FA Cup but were unable to beat Manchester City in the Premier League title race. Liverpool were also beaten 1-0 by Real Madrid in the final of the Champions League in Paris. There has already been a change in attack for Liverpool with the arrival of Nunez. Nunez looks likely to replace Sadio Mane, who seems to be heading towards Bayern Munich this summer. However, Carragher has given Liverpool fans an inkling as to how he sees manager, Jurgen Klopp setting up his attack come next season, telling Sky Sports: “I think the start of next season Liverpool’s front three will be [Mohamed] Salah, Nunez and [Luis] Diaz on the left.”
