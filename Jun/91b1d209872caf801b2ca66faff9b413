Former Media Aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri, has cautioned members of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, against disparaging Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State and Samuel Ortom of Benue State. Omokri said Wike and Ortom laboured to build the opposition, hence should not be disparaged. The staunch supporter of PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar said the party should appeal and listen to both governors. In a tweet, Omokri said PDP should accommodate Wike and Ortom. “Stooping to conquer is not weakness. Nobody in the PDP should disparage Wike or Ortom. They should be appealed to and listened to. “The PDP ought to seek to understand them. And then to accommodate them. When people who labour to build get angry, you embrace them!” Omokri tweeted. The PDP has been engulfed in crisis since Atiku picked Governor Ifeanyi Okowa as his running mate. To this end, Ortom had called on Atiku to reach out and appease Wike, who came second during the party’s presidential primary. Similarly, former Governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti State called for a Southern Presidency in 2023. Fayose insisted that the Southern part of the country must produce Nigeria’s presidency in 2023
