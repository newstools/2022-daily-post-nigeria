Niger State Government has constituted a committee to investigate the cause and increase in death cases in private health facilities in the state. The chairman of the committee, Dr Haruna Aliyu, who stated this in Minna, shortly after touring private health facilities in local government areas, said the measure was adopted to avert more deaths in such facilities. He explained that the state government has received many reports concerning deaths of patients in private hospitals which have become alarming. Aliyu argued that checks have shown that inadequate health personnel, quacks in the health facilities and professionals who do not operate around their areas of specialization are responsible for the increasing cases of deaths in private health facilities. He also revealed that the committee had just concluded investigations from LGAs where several private health facilities in the rural areas are either operating illegally or in unregistered premises. According to him, “We saw many things during our tour on the local government areas with regards to the issue of inappropriate personnel in private health facilities, inadequate equipment needed for such health facilities, there were so many facilities that are not registered by the appropriate bodies within the state. Although no facility was closed, the representatives of the health professional bodies in the committee have taken note of the outcome of the investigation and would begin to act soon.” The Chairman further stated that the committee would submit its reports and recommendations to the state government, while expressing optimism that the recommendations would be acted upon and implemented.
