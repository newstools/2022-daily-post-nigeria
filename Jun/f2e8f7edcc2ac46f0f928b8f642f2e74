A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Zamfara State, Alhaji Jibril Adamu has lamented that there are indications that the party may go into the 2023 general elections unprepared. Speaking with DAILY POST in Gusau, the State capital, Alhaji Jibril said that the PDP does not have a strong political candidate to challenge the long domination of the APC in the State, pointing out that the party leaders in the State were always out of the State. “The Party’s governorship candidate, Dr. Dauda Lawal Dare is not a force to be reckoned with because he is not a politician but a former banker and a business mogul. “He does not even have any political structure on ground to support his political ambition but it is agreed that he is a money bag, which cannot take him to the Government House”, he said. According to him, Dare is a newcomer into Zamfara State politics and “is supposed to be very close to his people, especially the grassroots but he is always in Abuja, hoping to win election from Abuja. “Zamfara people are now wiser than before, they would collect his money and vote for the candidates of their choices during the 2023 general elections. “Even if he is politically strong, he cannot stand the political powers of APC heavyweights in the State, especially now that Governor Matawalle, former Governor Abdul Aziz Yari and Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa have come together to work as a team to promote their party.” He said that even the APC presidential candidate, Alhaji Ahmed Bola Tinubu commended Governor Matawalle for taking a wise decision by reconciling with former Governor Yari and Senator Marafa. Jibril wondered why somebody that has an ambition for governorship position should be far away from his constituency, pointing out most of the PDP supporters in the State were gradually defecting to other parties.
