The Olukere of Ikere, Oba Obasoyin Ganiyu, on Saturday, lauded the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the smooth conduct of the ongoing governorship poll in Ekiti State. Ganiyu told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ikere-Ekiti that the simultaneous accreditation and voting had saved a lot of time. He said the process cast away tension, which also simplified the process. According to him, before now, it used to be a long process that wasted much time, and in the end, many electorates lost interest in voting. He said, “A situation where you come and vote at the same time is so impressive and a good development in our electoral system.” The traditional ruler commended the INEC for the new technology being used in the election and the timely supply of every material needed, adding that the commission should keep the good work going. Ganiyu also decried the unruly behaviour of some military men posted to the town for the election. According to him, they were intimidating and chasing people away from the polling units. He said, “The military are trained for war, not for election purposes. “I pray that the time will come when the military will not intervene in the election process.” Ganiyu added, “Ekiti South Local Government Area is our home, and we must join hands to ensure that we build it up to a better place for all of us to dwell.” The voting was largely peaceful, but there were incidents of minor clashes among the party supporters in some polling centres.
