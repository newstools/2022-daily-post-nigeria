A former Special Assistant to a former Governor of Kaduna State, Namadi Sambo, Zachariah Diwong, has described as ridiculous, claims by the Chairman of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), Ango Abdullahi, that the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar cannot fix Nigeria. Abdulahi had in a recent interview with a national paper suggested that Nigeria will be in chaos if either the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu or Atiku emerged President of Nigeria. Diwong in a statement issued Tuesday said only the people of Nigeria have the right to decide who they would vote for and not Abdulahi who is primarily interested in causing confusion for the sake of his desire for publicity. He noted that the agenda of the NEF chairman was not to move Nigeria forward but to throw a spanner in the works of any competent candidate because of his narcissistic arrogation to decide who should contest for the country’s highest political office. Diwong stressed that Nigerians do not need a lecture from Abdullahi because their current miserable experience of life was enough to motivate them to vote for change. Diwong said, “We understand Ango’s unhealthy obsession with publicity and his tendency to arrogate to himself the right to appoint leaders for Nigerians, but he should understand that he was only speaking for himself as an armchair critic. “The suggestion by Ango that Atiku cannot fix Nigeria is not only utterly ridiculous, but it is a reflection of detachment from our reality.” “If truly Ango cares about Nigerians, he cannot disregard experience and track record as the main qualifications for public office, especially the leadership of a country as large and diverse as Nigeria.”
