The Federal Government has said the power sector is currently on a fast track to delivering service to Nigerians and urged stakeholders to work together to achieve the feat. The Minister of Power, Mr Abubakar Aliyu, said this on Thursday in Abuja while inaugurating the new Governing Board of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN). He called on the members of the board to speak and act with one voice as the power sector was on track to quicken the delivery of service to Nigerians. “It is pertinent to appraise you of the very important job of TCN in the delivery of adequate and reliable electricity to Nigerians and the Nigerian economy. According to him, the electricity that is being delivered is not at the level to support the economy and the population. “We have been hovering around 5000 megawatts, either we go down a bit or we go up a bit for quite some time, we are unable to reach the level that we desired. “ TCN is the institution responsible for transporting wholesale energy from the off-grid power plant spread across the country to electricity distribution companies, ‘’ he said.
