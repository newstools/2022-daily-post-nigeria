Chelsea have reportedly shortlisted four centre-backs to sign this summer transfer window. According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, the Premier League giants have added Napoli’s Kalidou Koulibaly to their growing wishlist of center-backs. Apart from the Senegalese international, Chelsea are also keeping tabs on Juventus’ Matthijs de Ligt, Sevilla’s Jules Kounde and Manchester City’s Nathan Ake. Koulibaly has been at the heart of Napoli’s defense for eight seasons, featuring in 317 matches across all competitions. The 31-year-old made 34 appearances last season, scoring three goals and providing three assists. Koulibaly will be out of contract with Napoli in 2023. Meanwhile, Chelsea need to reinforce defense following the departure of Antonio Rudiger to Real Madrid earlier this month. The likes of Andreas Christensen, Cesar Azpilicueta and Marcos Alonso are also rumored to be on their way to joining Barcelona from Chelsea in the ongoing transfer window.
