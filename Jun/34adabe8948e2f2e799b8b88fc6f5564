The presidential candidate of the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP), Rabiu Kwankwaso, on Friday, visited the Governor of Rivers state, Nyesom Wike in Port Harcourt. Although the agenda has not been made official, it may not be unconnected to the 2023 general elections. Former Governor of Ekiti state, Ayodele Fayose, was also present. This comes a day after the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, visited Wike. After his visit, Obi tweeted: “Earlier, I visited Port Harcourt, to confer with H.E. @GovWike on vital issues of national interest.” Obi has also insisted he is still in talks with Kwankwaso over a possible merger.
