Arsenal have offered Manchester City’s Gabriel Jesus a €16million-a-year contract, which works out around £264,000-a-week, to join them. The UK Mirror reports that Jesus’ contract will rise to €17m-a-year which is around £280,000-a-week, if the Gunners qualify for the Champions League. The 25-year-old is Mikel Arteta’s top transfer priority, although Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur are also keen. Arteta is looking to bolster his frontline, after both Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang left the Emirates in the last six months. Arsenal have tied down Eddie Nketiah to a new long-term deal, handing him Thierry Henry’s old No14 shirt. But Nketiah is the only senior centre-forward in Arteta’s squad and the manager knows he needs reinforcements. Jesus has a decent record at City, where he has scored 95 goals in 236 games and helped them win four Premier League titles, four EFL Cups and the FA Cup.
