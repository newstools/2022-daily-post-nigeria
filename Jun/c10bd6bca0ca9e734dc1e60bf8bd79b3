The Inspector-General of Police, Usman Akali Baba has dissociated the security agency from a trending video. In a viral footage, a Chief Superintendent attached to the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) of Abia State Police Command accused Fulanis of kidnapping. The officer also declared that the Nigerian Army was working with criminal gangs. “The Fulanis are kidnapping our people. They go to cattle market to spend the money after collecting ransom. The Army are not helping us”, he fumed. The CSP made the comments on Sunday while addressing protesters at a location in Umunneochi Local Government Area. In a statement Wednesday night, Force Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi said his address was done in an unprofessional manner. The spokesman said the officer was at the area to carry out a rescue operation led by an Assistant Commissioner of Police. Adejobi maintained that he had no locus standi to address the press or persons, as such is the sole responsibility of the Commissioner of Police and the Police Public Relations Officer. “His impetuous and unguarded statements expressly contradict salient provisions of the Social Media Policy, Police Act and Regulations, and Code of Conduct for Police Officers, as well as extant laws regulating the conduct and activities of police officers.” The statement added that utterances do not represent the principles, ideals, position, and ethics of the Nigeria Police Force. Baba assures that the robust synergy with the military and other security agencies in maintaining internal security will continue.
