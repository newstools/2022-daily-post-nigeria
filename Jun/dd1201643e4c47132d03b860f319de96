The Akwa Ibom State Police Command has arrested famous Nollywood actor, Moses Armstrong for allegedly raping a 16-year-old girl. Emeka Rollas, the national president of the Actors’ Guild of Nigeria, confirming Armstrong’s arrest, stated that the case is “a very serious one”. He disclosed that the case is being handled by Akwa Ibom’s First Lady, Martha Udom Emmanuel through her Family Empowerment and Youth Re-Orientation Path Initiative. Rollas said: “To get involved with a child as young as 16 years, is not something I and the association I represent stand for. “This is a very sad development involving a member of ours, but I would not want to comment any further on this case.” The AGN president added that the organisation frowns at such a crime.
