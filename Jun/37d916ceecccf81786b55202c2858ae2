Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) vice presidential candidate, Ifeanyi Okowa, has lambasted his critics. Okowa has been facing criticisms from some quarters since his emergence as the running mate of PDP flagbearer, Atiku Abubakar. On Friday, he fired back at his critics after inspecting ongoing projects at the Dennis Osadebey University, Asaba. The Delta Governor told them to visit the state to assess the level of infrastructural development. “People in Lagos and Abuja say that they are not seeing what we are doing. “It is either that they don’t come or that they just want to be wicked in their ways”, NAN quoted him saying. On the N25billion loan for oil palm farmers, Okowa said it was not a state loan but that of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). He explained that the Delta government only acts as guarantor to the farmers. “It’s unfortunate what critics are saying, they need to be informed. “We are only like a guarantor to the farmers, the oil palm farmers in the state. “It’s going to be monitored but somebody needs to guarantee it for them and that is just what we have done,” Okowa said. The governor encouraged Nigerians to embrace the PDP and assured the Atiku-Okowa ticket would deliver good governance.
