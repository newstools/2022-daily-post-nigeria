Manchester City has picked Cole Palmer as a replacement for departing Raheem Sterling. Sterling is on the brink of being sold to Chelsea after seven trophy-laden years at the Etihad Stadium. Chelsea is especially keen on signing the England international this summer while Real Madrid and Barcelona are also interested. Sterling has just one year left on his contract and wants to play for a club where he will be a guaranteed starter. Sterling feels he may not have the opportunity he needs to make England’s World Cup team for the Qatar tournament later this year. The Times reports that Chelsea’s new owner, Todd Boehly wants to make Sterling his first marquee signing. And when he is gone, Guardiola will not bring in a new player to replace him but will give Palmer more minutes. Palmer made his senior City debut in 2020 and scored three goals in 11 games last season, as he looks to build upon a highly successful youth career.
