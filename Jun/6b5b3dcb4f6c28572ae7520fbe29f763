The Osun Progressives (TOP), has restated it will not yield space to the fair-weather politicians who currently hold the Osun All Progressives Congress (APC) by the jugular. TOP, a caucus of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State at its stakeholders’ meeting in Osogbo, denounced the rumour making the rounds that the caucus is forging a working relationship with different parties ahead of the July 16 governorship election. The group which disowned any individual or group using its name or that of its patron, Rauf Aregbesola, to negotiate, noted that the caucus will not stoop low to engage in contractual politics. Making this known in a press statement, the group’s chairman, Adelowo Adebiyi said anybody who is holding discussions with or negotiating with other political parties is doing so at their own risk. Adebiyi while reiterating TOP’s focus on reclaiming the party urged members of the group all over the state to remain steadfast and resilient in the pursuit of the noble goal. He encouraged them to be proud of themselves as their position on the mismanagement of the primary elections into the state and national assembly is rational, reasonable and sacrosanct. “The disgraceful protests that followed the exercises and the inability to declare results till now is a vindication of our position that Osun APC is in a mess. “We will always be proud of our inheritance in progressives politics hallmarked by life more abundant for the generality of people of Osun.” The group which congratulated Bola Ahmed Tinubu on his emergence as the APC presidential candidate for the 2023 general elections also called the attention of the APC National Chairman, Adamu Abdullahi to the degeneration of affairs in Osun APC.
