The family of a nine-year-old boy, Ahmed Yakubu who was gruesomely murdered for rituals on the 9th December 2021 has appealed to the minister of Justice and the Attorney General of the federation to intervene in the matter as justice appears to have been miscarried. The family said their some was inhumanly and gruesomely murdered for N500,000 naira, saying three suspects were arrested and made confessional statements to the state governor. Addressing newsmen at the press centre in Gusau, Zamfara State, the leader of the boy’s family, Salisu Abdulrahaman confirmed that the state police command had arraigned the three suspects at the chief Magistrate court in Gusau but the family has been kept in darkness. “We are therefore suspecting that some influential individuals must have stopped the case to deny us justice. This is because both the court, the state government and the police have remained silent over the issue since then” he added. According to Abdulrahman, the Magistrate, Saadu Gurbin – Bore had since transferred the case to the State Ministry of Justice, saying that his court has no jurisdiction to entertain the matter. Relations of the deceased boy said since the case was transferred to the State’s Ministry of Justice, they have not heard anything and that nobody has tоld them exactly the position of the matter. On the 9th of December 2021, Ahmed Yakubu was declared missing and the case was reported to the police which led to the arrest of principal suspects, Aminu Baba, Ahmed Tukur and one other person who confessed that he murdered the boy for ritual purposes. “The mastermind of the murder, Aminu Baba confessed to the police that he paid the sum of N500,000 for the human parts, saying that he promised to add some money for Ahmed Tukur when he comes back from his Kaduna trip.
