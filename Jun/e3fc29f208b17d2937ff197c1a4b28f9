The Police in Lagos State have arrested two herders at the Age Mowo area of Badagry. The cattle rearers were taken into custody on Monday over the alleged killing of a man. A video seen by DAILY POST shows the lifeless body of the victim on the ground as mourners gathered. Police spokesman, SP Benjamin Hundeyin provided details of the incident. Hundeyin said the victim was mistaken for the conductor of a LT Volkswagen commercial bus. The vehicle earlier ran into a herd of cattle and killed a cow at about 6.30am. “The two cattle herders attacked someone they mistook for the vehicle conductor, resulting in his death. The herders have been arrested”, Hundeyin tweeted. The PRO confirmed that angry residents and commuters blocked the highway in protest. Later, the DPO, Morogbo Division, assisted by soldiers from 243 Recce Battalion, Badagry, successfully cleared the obstruction. The command said it is false that the victim was turned back when he sought refuge in a police station. “He did not make it off the accident scene, let alone reach the station”, Hundeyin added. The police assured that normalcy had been restored to the area. An investigation has commenced.
