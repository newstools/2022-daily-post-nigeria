The Adamawa State House of Assembly has established a five-man committee to look into the persisting conflict between Lunguda and Waje communities in Guyuk and Lamurde local government areas. The Assembly mandated the Committee to unravel the circumstances surrounding the perennial clashes and to proffer an enduring route to peace in the affected communities. The Committee constituted during the Assembly’s Tuesday sitting, has the Majority Leader, Hon Hammantukur Yetisuri(Jada Mbulo) as its Chairman, while Hon Myandassa Bauna (Lamurde), Hon. Bathiya Wesley (Hong), Hon Adwawa Donglock (Guyuk), and Hon Abdullahi Ahmadu (Leko Koma) are members. The Committee has two weeks to carry out its investigation and submit its recommendations. Speaker of the Assembly, Rt Hon Aminu Iya Abbas, who announced the membership of the committee while presiding over the sitting, urged the committee to carry out its assignment with a sincere mind.  The constitution of the Committee followed a matter of urgent public interest brought before the Assembly by the member representing the Lamurde constituency, Hon Myandassa Bauna. Myandassa had while briefing his colleagues on recent clashes in the affected communities, said that enough is enough of what he described as annual bloody clashes. The latest violence between the Lunguda and Waja people last week resulted in the death of four people in addition to the destruction of valuable properties. The feuding communities have been at war, reportedly over land, for many years, and the conflict have tended to recur virtually every year, especially around the beginning of the rain-fed farming season.
