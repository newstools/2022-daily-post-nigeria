An attack by a notorious bandit, Bello Turji on another bandit group, based in Shinkafi Local Government Area of Zamfara State has led to the killing of two notorious bandits, Dullu and Dan Maigari, alongside 15 others. The bloody clash between the two sides took place on Tuesday morning. A source told DAILY POST that the recent clash by the two notorious gangs followed the killing of a bandit kingpin on Turji’s side, Na-Sanda. According to the source, Turji gathered fighters that are loyal to him and launched an unexpected attack at the Maniya hideouts of the rival gang where they killed some of the gang’s members, including Dullu himself and Dan Maigari, a younger brother of Bashari Maniy, a noted bandit turned intermediary. The source further explained that gunmen were seen crossing the Moriki-Shinkafi Road from Maniya into Sububu Forest, escaping from the onslaught. He alleged that Turji abducted some men from the area, but he later killed them, saying that Dullu’s corpse and some others have been abandoned at his own base. The source stated, “Turji himself is believed to have lost some men. I have seen some of them returning with bullet wounds,” the source said. SP Shehu Mohammed, the spokesman of the Zamfara Police Command, could not respond to a call put to his phone to confirm the incident.
