Tragedy struck in the late hours of Tuesday in Akure, the Ondo State capital, following the death of a family of five who died in an auto crash. The victims, a father, mother, and their three children lost their lives when the car they were riding in rammed into a stationary heavy-duty truck. The accident occurred around 10:00 pm on Tuesday in the Oluwatuyi area of the Ijoka axis. The man, who was said to have driven an Akure taxi-painted car with his family, was headed home from the Shoprite area along Ijo-Mimo road, which is under construction when they met their untimely death. According to sources, the driver was at high speed when the accident occurred. An eyewitness, who is also a taxi driver, stated that there was no way the deceased would not have seen such a huge truck. He went on to say that the motorist must have been driving at high speed, exacerbating the impact of the collision and that he was under the influence of alcohol. He claimed that while they tried to recover their remains, the man reeked of alcohol. The Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, SP Fumilayo Odunlami, confirmed the incident. With the identities of the victims yet to be revealed, their remains have been deposited at the morgue of the University Medical Teaching Hospital, UNIMEDTH, Akure.
