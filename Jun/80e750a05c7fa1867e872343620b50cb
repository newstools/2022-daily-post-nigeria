The senatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun Central, Olumide Aderinokun, has expressed concerns that Nigerians are celebrating the Democracy Day without foods on their table. Aderinokun regretted that many Nigerian youths are unemployed even as many graduate from universities, polytechnics and other higher learning institutions across the nation every year. The senatorial candidate spoke on Sunday while hundreds of Ogun indigenes embarked on what he termed ‘Democracy Day Walk’ in Abeokuta. “There is hunger in the land, there are no jobs for the graduates and other youths. Our market women and farmers can’t work because of the poor economy,” Aderinokun said while addressing reporters. “June 12 is alive again because it is part of our history as a country. The walk is not about any political campaign. It is a wake up call that the people are tired of bad leadership in the country,” he stated. According to him, the nation’s democracy need to be sustained if there would be good governance that will foster peace, stability and growth. He expressed confidence that with the support of the people, “by this time next year, in 2023, we will be moving into a new season of freedom, economic prosperity, and community developments in Ogun State.” The walk, which started from the Skating Ground in Panseke axis of Abeokuta, terminated at the NIPCO Filling Station in Oke Itoku. At the family house of Chief MKO Abiola, the winner of the annulled June 12 1993 election, Aderinokun was welcomed by community leaders and youths as he stopped briefly to pay his homage. He assured the Abiola family of his continuous support, promising to make the walk an annual event.
