The Cross River gubernatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Sandy Onor has warned the Governor, Ben Ayade not to obtain any further loans. According to him, the government is allegedly conniving with the state House of Assembly to borrow another N35 billion just to increase the debt burden from $279 million for the next government. Onor spoke at a news conference held at the NUJ press centre on Saturday, saying it is sheer wickedness for Ayade’s All Progressives Congress, APC, government to insist on doing so. He called on the people and stakeholders not to allow the state government so that the next government, which he believed to be his, will not be crippled before taking off. However, he said even if they succeeded in their moves it would be illegal, because presently, and in the eyes of the law there is no House of Assembly in the state. “Anything that carries the imprimatur of this assembly is null and void ab initio. This should therefore serve as a warning to all financial institutions in and outside Nigeria, not to grant any loan in whatever form, to the current government in Cross River State. This is because they will be doing so at very high risk. “Until the courts pronounce otherwise, the assembly as currently constituted, cannot enact legally binding resolutions and laws,” he said.
