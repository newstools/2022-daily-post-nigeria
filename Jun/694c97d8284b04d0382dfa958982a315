Wilfred Ndidi is back in full training at Leicester City after recovering from the knee injury which sidelined him towards the end of last season. Ndidi picked up the injury in a UEFA Europa Conference League Round of 16 clash against French club, Stade Rennes. The Nigerian international went under the knife a few days later. The injury forced him to miss Nigeria’s 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying fixture against the Black Stars of Ghana in March. The 24-year-old also missed the friendlies against Mexico and Ecuador as well as the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Sierra Leone and Sao Tome. The Foxes shared the news of Ndidi’s return to training sessions on their Twitter handle. “Back with the squad. Looking good out there, @Ndidi25,” the Tweet reads. Alongside the Tweet is a video of Ndidi participating in the pre-season training with his Leicester City teammates. Ndidi made 31 appearances across all competitions for Leicester City last season with two goals and one assist to his name.
