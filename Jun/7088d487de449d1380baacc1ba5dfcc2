Anyim Pius Anyim has congratulated Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, the running mate of former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar. The Delta helmsman was on Thursday announced as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) vice presidential candidate. In a statement on Friday, Anyim, who sought the platform’s ticket, expressed satisfaction with his emergence. The Ebonyi-born former Senate President described Okowa as a cool-headed public official. Okowa, he noted, has remained “a cool-headed and focused leader who has devoted his time and energy to the service of our dear country in various capacities”. “I have no doubt that Sen. Okowa will effectively complement H.E Atiku Abubakar for the urgent task of rescuing, reuniting and rebuilding our dear country”, Anyim added. After the May 28 PDP primary, DAILY POST reported that Okowa was one of the VP slot nominees. Others included his Akwa Ibom counterpart, Governor Udom Emmanuel and former Imo Governor, Emeka Ihedioha.
