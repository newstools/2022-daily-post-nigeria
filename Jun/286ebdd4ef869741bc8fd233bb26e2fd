The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has reacted to the emergence of Bola Tinubu as the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate. PDP said Tinubu was “desperate for the keys to Nigeria’s treasury,” but its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, would defeat him in the 2023 elections. In a series of tweets, the opposition party insisted that Tinubu was not a match for Atiku. According to PDP: “@OfficialPDPNig mocks @officialABAT for clinching at very great price, the Presidential ticket of the moribund, decrepit and crippled @OfficialAPCNg, which has since served out its purpose as a fraudulent contraption that brought in the failed, corrupt and rudderless administration of President @MBuhari. “Our Party also sympathizes with Asiwaju for embarking on a journey to nowhere as he is no match for @OfficialPDPNig’s more popular, more competent and more prepared Presidential Candidate, His Excellency, @Atiku the unifier and the people’s choice, who defeated President @MBuhari fair and square in the 2019 Presidential election. “@officialABAT will soon realize that Nigeria is not one of his acquired estates or fiefdoms and that the Nigerian people are not his political string-puppets and retinue of lackies, from whom he bought the @OfficialAPCNg Presidential ticket. “@officialABAT will also soon realize that Nigerians hold him responsible for his self-confessed role in installing the failed @MBuhari-led administration that subjugated the people, brought excruciating economic hardship, acute poverty, bloodletting, terrorism, mass killings, promoted disunity, tribalism and nepotism, lawlessness, massive treasury looting and unpardonable life-discounting experiences to our country.”
