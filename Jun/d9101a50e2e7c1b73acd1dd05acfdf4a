Former Governor and Senator Representing Imo West Senatorial District, Rochas Okorocha has spoken for the first time since polling zero votes at the presidential primary election of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Tuesday. There was panic in some quarters that the former governor of Imo State may dump the party after failing to clinch the ticket. However, the ex-governor in a release made available to journalists by the Special Adviser ( Media), Sam Onwuemeodo on Friday, said Okorocha wishes Asiwaju, success as he flies the Presidential flag of the APC in the 2023 election. Okorocha said, ” I commend all those who participated in the APC party primary for its presidential ticket. Okorocha said, ” I congratulate Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, on his victory at the Presidential Primary election of the All Progressives Congress, APC. Recall that DAILY POST had reported that over 2,000 accredited delegates voted at the polls to decide the ruling party’s ticket bearer for the 2023 general election. The former Governor of Imo State was on the ballot despite having a running battle with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) over fraud.
