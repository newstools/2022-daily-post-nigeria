The Commandant General, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Ahmed Abubakar Audi, on Wednesday, charged all the personnel deployed to Ekiti gubernatorial election slated for June 18, 2022 election to be professional in their conducts by allowing the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) of the Corps to guide their performances. In a statement by DCC Olusola Odumos, Director, Public Relations, NSCDC National Headquarters, Abuja, said the CG who has approved the deployment of 9,747 officers and men, noted that the service must remain apolitical and neutral to avoid any form of compromise during the election. He maintained that necessary machinery has been put in place to provide effective security for INEC officials, sensitive and non sensitive materials, before, during and after the election, reiterating that all the 2,445 polling units, collation centres, flashpoints and other criminal hideouts are fully covered. According to him, the personnel from Kogi, Edo, Lagos, Oyo, Osun, Ogun, Ondo, Zone J and the National Headquarters have been drafted to support the Ekiti State Command in beefing up security for the polls and protecting Critical National Assets in all the 16 local government areas of the state. “The composition of the deployment for Ekiti election includes personnel from the Arms Squad, Chemical, Biological Radiological and Explosives Unit (CBRNE) Special Weapon and Tactics (SWAT), Kennel Unit, Counter-Terrorism Unit, Rapid Response Squad (RRS), Special Female Squad, Ops Special Squad and CG’s Special Monitoring team,” he said. He, however, assured the people of Ekiti State of a hitch-free election process as the corps will be working in synergy with other security agencies involved in the conduct of the exercise to protect the electorate and arrest any criminal trying to destabilize the state. He warned parents to put their wards in check at this critical period in the state’s history, so that they won’t be easy tools in the hands of do or die politicians seeking to hijack ballot boxes or cause mayhem to overturn the election. According to him, the Assistant Commandant General (ACG) Special Duties, Haruna Lawal Muhammed, who will be assisted by the Zonal Commander (Zone J) and other Senior Officers in the zone has been deployed to head and coordinate the election operations in the state.
