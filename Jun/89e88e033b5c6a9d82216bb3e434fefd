Portuguese Primeira Liga champions, FC Porto are demanding €25 for their Nigerian defender, Zaidu Sanusi. Zaidu Sanusi has generated interest from clubs in the English Premier League. Fulham, Crystal Palace, Brighton & Hove Albion and Everton are rumoured to be keen on luring the left-back to England. The 25-year-old has a €50 release clause in his contract, but Porto, according to Portuguese publication, O Jogo, are willing to sell the Nigerian for half of that price. Sanusi, who is represented by super agent, Jorge Mendes, is open to a move to England this summer. He scored the goal which won Porto the title last season.
