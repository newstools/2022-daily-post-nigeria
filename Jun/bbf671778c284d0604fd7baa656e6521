Senator Yahaya Abdullahi, the Senate Leader, has defected from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kebbi State. Abdullahi’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity Muhammad Jamil Gulma confirmed the defection on Tuesday. “Senate Leader Dr Yahaya Abdullahi will on Wednesday by 9am leave Abuja for Kebbi and proceed to Kamba local government to formally declare for PDP and to possibly indicate his interest to contest his present seat,” Gulma was quoted by Vanguard as saying. Yahaya had participated in the APC’s Kebbi governorship primaries, in which it was reported to have scored zero votes. He had since rejected the outcome and described it as shambolic and a child’s play. It was learnt that his defection might not be unconnected with the governorship primaries and many failed truces by the national leadership of the APC.
