Rangers midfielder, Joe Aribo says he is focused on staying at the club despite rumours linking him with a move away from Ibrox. Aribo’s contract with the Gers will expire in 2023 and the Nigerian is yet to pen a new deal fuelling speculations he could be set for a move elsewhere. The versatile midfielder has also been linked with a move to the Premier League, with the likes of Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and West Ham United said to be interested in his services. The 25-year-old has, however, debunked the reports and stated that he is focused on continuing at the club. “I don’t know. I never knew about anything to be honest, I just focused on football. I’m happy at Rangers, I’ve been happy since I got here and I’ve loved every single minute of it,” Aribo told Brila FM. “So I’ve just been focused on here and I just want to stay focused because at the end of the day, I’m a Rangers player and I’m not thinking about leaving, because I’m really happy here,” he said. Aribo scored nine goals and provided 10 assists in 56 appearances across all competitions for Rangers in the 2021/22 season.
