Former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, has been banned from undertaking any further duties as visiting professor at the University of Lincoln after he was accused of trafficking a 15-year-old boy to the United Kingdom for organ harvesting. Ekweremadu and his wife, Beatrice, are currently in detention over the charges ahead of a court date on July 7. They have both denied the trafficking charges. Ekweremadu, before his arrest, met with members of the Nigerian community in Lincoln. He had been a visiting professor of corporate and international linkages at the University of Lincoln. But a spokesperson of the institution told Daily Mail: “Visiting professors are often, as is in this case, non-resident at the university, unpaid and advisory. “We are deeply concerned about the nature of these allegations but as this is an active police investigation, we cannot comment further at this stage. “Whilst this matter is subject to investigation, this person will not be undertaking any duties as visiting professor at Lincoln,” the spokesperson said.
