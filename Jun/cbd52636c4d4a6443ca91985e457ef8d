Pastor David Ibiyeomie, General Overseer of Salvation Ministry has declared that all ritualists who kill to make money will die this week. The popular gospel preacher made the declaration during a sermon at the church’s headquarters in Port Harcourt, Rivers State capital. He urged Nigerians to refrain from ritual killings, saying God has warned against the shedding of innocent blood in the quest for wealth. He said, “If anybody has used charm to kill someone around you, this week, that person will die. God is saying, “don’t shed blood to get money”. Stop pounding children, get clean money. “Don’t do Yahoo plus. It is demonic. Some people use their mother that gave birth to them, even their relations for money. What kind of money is that? What kind of money will make you see your blood relations dying and you are happy”? DAILY POST reports that some internet fraudsters popularly known as Yahoo boys were recently arrested over ritual killings.
