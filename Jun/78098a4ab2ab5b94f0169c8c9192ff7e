Former Big Brother Naija housemate, Liquorose has revealed that her boyfriend who was also a housemate in the Shine Ya Eye edition, Emmanuel cheated on her. Liquorose who made this known during the reunion show on Friday narrated that she caught Emmanuel and an unknown lady in his room in Dubai. Some fans had predicted that their relationship had hit the rocks, especially with Emmanuel’s absence from Liquorose’s birthday party in March. Confirming the incident, Liquorose accused Emmanuel of disrespecting, lying and cheating while they had a relationship. She explained that she walked in on Emmanuel in a very compromising position with another lady during their Dubai trip in November 2021. Liquorose said she had wanted to surprise Emmanuel but when she went to his room, it took him 15 minutes to open the door. “We were dating, right? And I walked into you and a girl in Dubai? The light was off and music was playing. “The bed was rough and the girl was sitting at the edge and she covered her face with a face mask.” “It took him 15 minutes to open the door and this was after I pleaded that it was an emergency and I needed to see him. “When I saw them, I stormed out of the room and my so-called boyfriend did not even follow me to explain all that I had seen in the room. “After the incident, he told me he didn’t want to be in a committed relationship although he still loved me.” In his reaction, Emmanuel said he didn’t want Liquorose to find out that someone was in his room because she wouldn’t understand that nothing happened. According to him, he found an old friend in Dubai and they decided to catch up in his room. He added that nothing sexual happened between him and the female friend but he decided to end the relationship because it was not working.
