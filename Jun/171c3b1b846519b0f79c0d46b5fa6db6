Two All Progressives Congress (APC) officials in Rivers died in an auto crash while returning from the party’s presidential primary. The names of the deceased are Onimitein Vincent Samuel (Akuku-Toru Ward 9) and Prince Motats Loveday, Esq. (Degema Ward 13). The chieftains were Akuku-Toru LGA APC Secretary and Degema LGA APC Secretary respectively. The party announced their death in a statement on Saturday by State Publicity Secretary, Chris Finebone. APC said it was devastated because the individuals “who were great assets died while in active service to the party they cherished and worked for”. “It is even more distressing that they were cut down in their prime leaving behind their young families to grieve their irreparable loss.” The party prayed that God repose the souls of the members, console their families and heal those undergoing treatment in hospitals. Reacting, former Rivers South-East Senator, Magnus Abe described the death of Samuel and Loveday as saddening. Abe urged the party faithful to support the immediate families as a mark of respect for the grassroots politicians. He prayed that “the Almighty God will grant them eternal rest and the sacrifice of their commitment to the APC shall not go in vain”.
