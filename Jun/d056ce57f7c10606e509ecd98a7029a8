Former Manchester United star, Teddy Sheringham, has urged the club’s new manager, Erik ten Hag, to sign six new players this summer. Sheringham believes Manchester United need to make several new signings this summer under Ten Hag in order to improve on last season’s disappointment. Recall that Man United finished in the sixth position on the Premier League table last season. “United need reinforcements across the pitch. In particular centre midfield, centre forward and on the wings,” He told Lord Ping, as reported in The Sun. “We are looking at five or six top players needing to come in. You need players to come in with the right character who appreciate the size of the task and are ready to get United back to where it should be. “It’s a massive challenge. From a player’s point of view, if you were to pick between City or United, then you are going to pick City every time at the moment.”
