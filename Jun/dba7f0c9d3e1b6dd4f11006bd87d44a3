Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, on Saturday, dismissed claims that President Muhammadu Buhari and northern governors would betray Bola Tinubu, the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate. Fani-Kayode said there is no conspiracy between Buhari and northern governors to betray Tinubu for the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. In a tweet, the former Aviation Minister insisted that no such conspiracy exists. He assured that Buhari, Norther APC governors, and leaders would not work against Tinubu. According to Fani-Kayode: “To those who believe that @MBuhari & the Northern Governors & leaders in @OfficialAPCNg are involved in a conspiracy to ensure that @atiku wins next year’s election and that they will betray @officialABAT and ensure that he loses, I say the following: no such conspiracy exists.” Tinubu emerged as APC flag bearer following the backing of Northern APC governors. APC northern governors had insisted that the party zone its presidential ticket to the southern party of the country, prior to the Abuja Special Convention. Despite APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, rooting for the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, the northern governors maintained that the south must produce the party’s presidential candidate.
