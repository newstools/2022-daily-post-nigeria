Ebonyi State Governor, Chief David Umahi on Sunday condemned in totality the gruesome killings and attack on St John Catholic Church, Owo in Ondo State. Umahi, a presidential aspirant on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, made this known in a statement signed and made available to journalists in Abakaliki, capital of Ebonyi State. The governor described the incident as sacrilegious, wondering why people take delight in unnecessary bloodletting. He expressed condolence to the affected families, the Catholic community, and the Government of Ondo State for the “unfortunate loss of lives”. Umahi called on security agencies to rise up and do all within their capacity to apprehend the bandits and forestall a reoccurrence of such incident in any part of the country. He also prayed to God to grant the deceased rest in his bosom and that the hoodlums meet their waterloo.
