Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has insisted that Gov. Yahaya Bello of Kogi, is his son. Tinubu stated this while commending Bello for mobilising the consciousness of youths during his campaign. He disclosed this when he visited Bello in Abuja, barely 72 hours after his emergence as the flag bearer of APC ahead of the 2023 presidential election. The former Lagos State governor was accompanied on the visit by three governors —Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos), Bello Matawalle (Zamfara), and Abdullahi Ganduje (Kano). A former Governor of Edo and ex-APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, was also at the meeting. “The man of the convention, the man of democracy for that day, was Muhammadu Buhari,” Tinubu said. “If you want to run, run; you want to crawl, crawl; you want to dance, dance. “Yahaya Bello is my son; you mobilised the consciousness of the youth in the county. You remind us of what the nation wants to be.” “The (opposition) thought there would be chaos and crisis. But we saw peace. Emi lokan. It’s my turn,” he added.
