President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday conferred the Grand Commander of the Order of the Niger (GCON) on the immediate past Chief Justices of Nigeria, CJN, Ibrahim Tanko. The award is the second-highest national honour that can be bestowed on any Nigerian national. The conferment took place at the swearing-in of Justice Olukayode Ariwoola as Acting Chief Judge of Nigeria at the State House. Speaking at the event, Buhari said the award was being conferred on the jurist for the good work he did while at the saddle as CJN. He showered encomium at Tanko, who resigned as the nation’s CJN on health grounds. He added that under Justice Muhammad’s watch the judiciary judiciously exercised its powers in line with the provisions of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
