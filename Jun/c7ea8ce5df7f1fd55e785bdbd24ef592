The Adamawa State Police Command has identified the soldier who lost his life during a recent clash between its operatives and those of the military. The Command named Sgt Ibrahim Ali of 23 Armoured Brigade, Yola, as the soldier who was killed during the conflict between soldiers from the brigade and policemen of the state command. The Police in a condolence message obtained Wednesday from the state Police Public Relations Officer, Suleiman Nguroje, said the Commissioner of Police, CP Sikiru Akande condoles with the Brigade Commander, officers and men of 23 Brigade over the sudden death of their personnel. The police described the personnel, Sgt Ibrahim Ali, as a gallant and dedicated officer whose death occurred in the late hours of Sunday, 29th May 2022, along Numan road while on duty. “The Commissioner of Police acknowledges the command’s cordial working relationship with the military. He therefore condoles with the immediate family, relatives and friends of the deceased who got killed in an unfortunate incident while in active service to his fatherland and prays for the repose of his soul,” the police stated. The Adamawa Police Command had earlier on Monday confirmed the police-military clash following which a soldier died. The police had said in a statement on the clash that the Commissioner of Police strongly condemned the conflict between Police officers and the military along Numan Road that resulted in an exchange of fire and the killing of a military officer. The police command had assured then that it would spare no effort in identifying its operatives who were complicit in the death of the soldier and ensure justice.
