A man in Adamawa State has been killed for asking to be repaid the N1,500 he lent a friend. The man, Bilham Babangida, was stabbed to death for demanding his N1,500 from his friend, Aliyu Hammanseyo. Hammanyeso allegedly got angry and stabbed Babangida in the chest, leading to his death after Banbangida asked for his money. A police report indicated on Wednesday that the incident happened on June 7, 2022, at Sabon-Layi, in Mubi North Local Government Area. Hammanyeso allegedly owed the deceased the said amount of money and when the deceased noticed that Hammanyeso had money, he demanded a refund of his N1,500, which Hammanyeso would not give but became violent instead. He allegedly stuck a knife in the chest of Babangida, leading to his death, as confirmed by a medical report from Mubi General hospital. It was also gathered that Hammanyeso was on Monday arraigned before a Chief Magistrate Court Yola where he pleaded guilty to the offence charged against him. On a request by Police prosecutor Francis Audu for an adjournment to enable the conclusion of Investigations, the Chief Magistrate Muhammed Abubakar adjourned the case to July 14 and ordered that the defendant be remanded in a correctional centre.
