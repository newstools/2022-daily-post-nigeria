The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) says it received safety information from the European Rapid Alert System for dangerous non-food products (RAPEX) that a cosmetic product, Placentyne Hair Lotion has been banned. The information was contained in a public alert with No. 0033/2022, signed by the Director-General of NAFDAC, Prof. Moji Adeyeye, and issued to NAN on Saturday in Abuja. According to the alert, the product contains a mixture of preservatives, Methylchloroisothiazolinone and Methylisothiazolinone, which are forbidden in leave-on cosmetics. The statement disclosed that the product is sold in a 12 ampoules x 10ml cardboard box manufactured by an Italian company, Linea Italiana di Benazzi Anna & SAS, with a barcode No. 8029550000126. It added that Methylchloroisothiazolinone and Methylisothiazolinone are common preservatives which are found in many personal care products, which have been linked to lung toxicity, allergic reactions and possible neurotoxicity. The statement added, “Both chemicals inhibit bacterial growth in cosmetic products on their own, but they’re most commonly used as a mixture in products. “Members of the public in possession of the recalled lots of the product are implored to discontinue sale or use and hand over stock to the nearest NAFDAC office.”
