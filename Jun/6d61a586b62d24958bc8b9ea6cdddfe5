The Commissioner of Police, Kwara State Command, Tuesday Assayomo, has mapped out strategies to curtail likely attendant security risks of banned Okada operators from Lagos to the state. DAILY POST reports that following the ban placed on Okada operators in some local government areas of Lagos, effective from June 1, 2022, there has been anxiety among Kwarans who fear that the displaced Okada operators may head for Kwara due to its proximity. Consequently, the state police commissioner convened a security meeting with the command’s strategic security managers, at the Police Officers Mess, Ilorin. The meeting reviewed the existing security strategies in the state, mindful of some security breaches in some states leading to the death of many citizens, the banning of Okada operations in some states, especially Lagos State which has sent jitters in the spines of some Kwarans. The CP directed Area Commanders, Divisional Police Officers, and the Command’s Tactical Units to intensify patrols in their AORs, intensify intelligence gathering, and to also apply effective mobilization of vigilante groups, hunters, and other local security apparatus in their AORs. Spokesman of the command, SP Okasanmi Ajayi, in Ilorin said the CP, also called on motorcycle and tricycle unions in the state to embark on adequate profiling of both existing and new members for easy identification and monitoring. Assayomo, further advised the leadership of religious bodies on the appropriateness of putting some security arrangements in their places of worship, including CCTV cameras, and the employment of private or local guards to complement those provided by the police. The Commissioner of Police hinted at a proposed meeting with relevant non-state actors including student bodies to also discuss ways by which the police command could serve the citizens better. At the security meeting, the CP also decorated 31 newly promoted Inspectors to the ranks of Assistant Superintendent of Police, ASP, advising them to reciprocate the kind gesture of the Inspector General of Police, Alhaji Usman Alkali Baba, by working harder and continually represent the good image of the force wherever they are posted.
