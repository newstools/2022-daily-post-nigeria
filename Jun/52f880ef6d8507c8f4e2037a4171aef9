Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, has reacted to the arrest of two Nigerians, Ike Ekweremadu and Beatrice in the United Kingdom, UK. Omokri lamented that Ekweremadu’s “kit and kin” are leading the guilty charge against him when he has not been convicted. Metropolitan Police had said the couple was charged with conspiracy to facilitate the travel of another person for organ harvesting. The couple appeared before the Uxbridge Magistrate Court on Thursday afternoon and were denied bail According to Arise TV, the alleged victim is a homeless 15-year-old boy who was brought to the U.K. by Mr and Mrs Ekweremadu, from the streets of Lagos. Reacting, Omokri said the couple should not be condemned because they may be innocent. In a series of tweets, Omokri wrote: “The man could be innocent or guilty. We don’t know. A trial will determine his guilt. But what saddens me is the way and manner how his own people are leading the charge to crucify him. First have love amongst yourself before saying others don’t love you! “In the US, Trump’s crowd stayed loyal to him, no matter the charge. An accusation isn’t a conviction. I feel sorry for this red cap chief. His own people are the ones already condemning him! “Things are fluid. It just happened. It is out of character for him. There will be a trial to establish the truth. His own kith and kin should not lead the charge to speculatively condemn him. There will be more than enough time to condemn him if he is convicted! “His own people have totally forgotten the development he attracted to his area and are acting like he has already been convicted. I doubt he will be convicted. There must be an explanation. The man is not a pauper. It is sad how he is treated as an orphan by his own.”
