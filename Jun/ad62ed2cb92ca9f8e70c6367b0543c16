The All Progressives Congress (APC) national chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, has written to Bola Tinubu. The former Lagos State Governor won the presidential ticket at the primary in Abuja. Adamu had announced Senate President Ahmad Lawan as the preferred candidate of the party. In a letter Wednesday night, the former Senator extended the compliments of members of the National Working Committee (NWC). Adamu said his letter on behalf of all APC members was to congratulate Tinubu on “the sterling victory recorded”. The chairman said his emergence has vindicated the party’s nationalistic outlook and patriotic posture as the choice for every Nigerian. “I am pleased that the Party spoke with one voice when the delegates voted overwhelmingly to nominate you as our presidential candidate.” Adamu expressed hope that efforts between the national secretariat and Tinubu’s campaign team “will proceed with the shared expectations of victory at the 2023 general elections, by the grace of God”.
