Barcelona manager Xavi Hernandez has reportedly told winger Ousmane Dembele that there will be no new contract offer other than the one the club offered him back in December. This claim was made by a Spanish journalist, Javier Miguel. Miguel disclosed this in a tweet via his Twitter handle on Wednesday. According to him, Xavi revealed to him that Barcelona wouldn’t make another offer for Dembele, whose contract will expire this summer. He added that the France World Cup winner either has to accept the deal or leave Barcelona in the coming days. Miguel tweeted: “Dembele is one step away from dropping his pants and accepting the offer he has had since December and which he has systematically ignored/rejected. On Monday, I call Xavi asking him to intercede with Laporta. the technician, of course: ‘There will be no new offer; either you accept the one you have or goodbye.'” Barcelona last tabled an offer for Dembele in December last year that was rejected by the player’s representatives. Xavi wants the former Dortmund star to remain at Camp Nou. However, failure to agree to terms next week could see the 25-year-old forward leave the Catalan club.
