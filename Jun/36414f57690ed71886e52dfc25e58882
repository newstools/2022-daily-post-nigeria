Former Liverpool defender, Jose Enrique, has criticised forward Sadio Mane’s claims that he could leave Anfield if it is what the ‘Senegalese people’ want from him. Mane has been heavily linked with a move away from Liverpool to Bayern Munich this summer. Enrique took to his Instagram stories to voice his outrage at Mane’s comments, suggesting that he was more interested in the money that the German Bundesliga champions might offer him than the will of his compatriots. According to him, it is the worst excuse he ever heard from a player to leave a club. Enrique’s Instagram post read: “The worst excuse I ever heard from a player to leave a club. “He is and will stay as a legend for us, but please, Sadio, you want to leave because they pay you more somewhere else and it is fair but putting the excuse of the Senegalese people…” Mane became Senegal’s record goalscorer after a hat-trick against Benin in an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier on Saturday.
