Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State has berated the apex Igbo socio-political organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, over the voting pattern of South-East delegates during the just concluded presidential primary of the All Progressives Congress, APC. Umahi, who expressed displeasure with Ohanaeze Ndigbo, said he no longer believes in the organization. The ex-APC presidential aspirant spoke in the Uburu area of Ebonyi State on Saturday while accusing South-East delegates of a “high level of betrayal” during the APC presidential primary election in Abuja. Umahi insisted that it was a big shame that Igbos failed to make a statement with their delegates. According to Umahi: “The presidential election was an eye-opener to Ebonyi State. I thank God that through your support, we had a victory. We decided to contest so that the Igbo people would not say that we do not have qualified people. “The Igbo man has five States and we should be asking why. Is there any fairness? Other States have 40 to 50 local government areas. How do you expect an Igbo man to win? But the worst is the attitude of delegates from the South-East. I met with delegates from the South-East and begged them to vote for any aspirant from the South-East, and by doing so, we will make a statement. “Only Ebonyi people stood for both the PDP and APC. It is a very big shame that our people are crying over marginalization. I am ashamed of the President of Ohanaeze Ndigbo. He can no longer be my president. It is a very big shame every Igbo man should be weeping for himself. And let me warn the youths in Ebonyi State that those leaders selling us out should not be considered our leaders again.”
