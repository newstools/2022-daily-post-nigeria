Head coach of Nigeria, Jose Peseiro has expressed his delight after the team hammered Sao Tome and Principe 10-0 in a 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier on Monday. However, he admitted there is more work to be done. Victor Osimhen netted four goals, Moses Simon, Emmanuel Dennis, Ademola Lookman, Etebo and Moffi also got on the scoresheet for the Super Eagles. “About the 10-0 win? Yes, it’s good. “It is better for us [to get] three points, which is more important to us. Of course, I want to improve our organization on the field because we didn’t train too much with them. “We want to introduce our ideas – this match was good because they tried to follow our organisation, our style, our ideas. I am also happy because the guys who entered during the match did as well as those players who started,” Peseiro said.
