Sevilla defender, Jules Kounde, has received a five-year contract from Chelsea ahead of a proposed move from the Blues. According to Sport, Kounde has agreed to a five-year deal with Chelsea but a fee with Sevilla is yet to be struck. Sevilla is said to be holding out on a £56m transfer fee for Kounde. Chelsea was heavily linked with the 23-year-old last summer, but their bid failed to force Sevilla’s hand into selling. Kounde was said to be left fuming with Sevilla for denying him a move to the Premier League giants. The Frenchman may finally get his move away from Sevilla this summer, with a number of top clubs eyeing a move. Barcelona is also believed to be on the hunt for Kounde. The Catalan club believe a fee of £51.6 million is feasible, but Sevilla is hoping to collect closer to £56m. In order to beat Chelsea to Kounde’s signature, Barcelona would have to convince Kounde to accept half of what Thomas Tuchel’s men are offering.
