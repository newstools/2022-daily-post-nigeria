Real Madrid has said they are not interested in signing Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba this summer, according to Marca. Pogba’s Manchester United contract is set to expire later this month but Real Madrid’s primary target is Monaco’s Aurelien Tchouameni. The LaLiga champions will not move to bring in free agent, Pogba even if they do not manage to acquire Tchouameni’s services. Real Madrid director denied that Los Blancos have made contact with either the player or someone from his entourage. Juventus, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-German are said to be among the top European clubs chasing the France international. The Frenchman is said to be negotiating his potential return to Juventus, whom he departed to make his Manchester United comeback in 2016. Casemiro, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric, Fede Valverde and Eduardo Camavinga will be the players to form Real Madrid’s midfield for next season.
