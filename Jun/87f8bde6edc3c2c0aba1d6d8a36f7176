He said, “On behalf of my family, the government and the good people of Anambra, I express my sincere condolences on the passing of a great patriot, courageous soldier and officer gentleman, General Alexander Madiebo. “Though we would have loved him to still be with us, we take joy that he lived a life of service and accomplishment. “His contributions to nation building and development of his immediate environment remain strong reference points in patriotism and nationalism.” According to Soludo, Madiebo put his life on the line in protecting his people when it mattered most. He said, “It’s gratifying that while on the battlefields, he kept notes that enabled him to write one of the greatest books about the Nigerian civil war, “The Nigerian Revolution and the Biafran Civil War.” “We will surely miss his wise counsel and exemplary life of service to his fatherland.” Soludo prayed to God to grant Madiebo’s soul eternal rest and also grant members of his immediate family and relations the strength to bear the pains of his exit.
