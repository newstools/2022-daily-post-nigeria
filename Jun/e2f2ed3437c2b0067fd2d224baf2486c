Liverpool is seriously considering a move for Leeds United forward Raphinha as a possible replacement for Sadio Mane should the Senegal international leave Anfield this summer. The Reds could also use Takumi Minamino as a makeweight in the deal to sign Raphinha to replace Mane in the coming days. Mane, who is a target for Bayern Munich, is expected to leave Anfield this summer and the FA Cup and Carabao Cup champions are busy making plans to replace the former Southampton star. Liverpool has been long-time admirers of Raphinha but they face competition from Barcelona, who are also interested in the player. According to The Mirror, Liverpool’s interest has ramped up in recent days as Mane edges closer to leaving the club. The report added that Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp is so keen to sign Raphinha that he is willing to sacrifice Minamino, who has proved a useful squad player since moving to Merseyside two and a half years ago. It has been claimed that Leeds wants between £60million and £70million for their star player. Raphinha is currently on international duty with the Brazil national team. The 25-year-old scored 11 goals in 35 Premier League appearances for Leeds last season.
