Sierra Leone defender, Osman Kakay insists the Leone Stars can beat the Super Eagles in their 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier. John Keister’s men will be up against the Super Eagles next week Thursday at the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja. The Leone Stars rallied back from four-goals down to held the Super Eagles to a 4-4 draw the last time the two countries met in November 2020 at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, Benin City. Kakay, who plays for Sky Bet Championship club, Queens Park Rangers is however confident they can go a step further this time around by beating the Super Eagles. “I am optimistic going into both encounters against Nigeria and Guinea-Bissau. Firstly, I am convinced that we have the players to match a strong Nigeria team,” Kakay to FSL News. “We have a good chance if we apply ourselves well. We can get positive results to help us qualify. I know both games are not going to be easy. Guinea Bissau was in the recent AFCON, so they have the experience as well, but I am hopeful and look forward to both games.” The Leone Stars will host the Wild Dogs of Guinea-Bissau in their next game in the qualifiers at the General Lasana Conte Stadium, Conakry on Monday, June 13.
