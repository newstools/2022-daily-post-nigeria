The Oyo State chapter of the tLabour Party has disclosed that Barrister Julius Abure is the national chairman of the party. The party also said that Alhaji Farouk Ibrahim is the national secretary of the party. It made these declarations in a statement signed by the state Chairman of the party, Atayase Sadiq, and Secretary, Gabriel Ogunlana. Our correspondent gathered that one Callistus Okafor has been parading himself as National Chairman of the party. But, the duo of Sadiq and Ogunlana in the statement made available to DAILY POST Monday morning, insisted that Okafor is not known to the party. The duo added that both Abure and Ibrahim were elected at the national convention of the party. They insisted that all party faithful were in attendance when the election took place. They also added that former Governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, is the presidential candidate of the party. They said, “The recent claim by some individuals that the party’s national chairman is one Callistus Okafor is part of efforts by opposition figures to destabilise its ranks. “It has come to our notice of one individual by name Callistus Okafor laying claim to the national chairmanship of our great party, Labour Party. “We labour party in Oyo State wish to state that such an individual is not known to us nor to any other members of the party in all the states of the federation. We strongly believe that his position is the antics of some opposition figures that are being threatened by the daily rising profile of the Labour Party in Nigeria since the election of Peter Obi as our presidential candidate. “For the avoidance of doubt, our national chairman remains Barrister Julius Abure with Alhaji Farouk Ibrahim as the National Secretary. Both were elected at our national convention with all party faithfuls in attendance. And our presidential candidate is the incorruptible Peter Obi.”
