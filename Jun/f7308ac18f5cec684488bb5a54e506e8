Manchester City have agreed a deal with Leeds to sign midfielder Kalvin Phillips, according to Sky Sports. The fee for the England international is believed to be in the region of £45m to £50m. Phillips is now closer to leaving his boyhood club, where he came through the academy and came into the limelight under former manager, Marcelo Bielsa. The deal has yet to be officially completed, as Phillips still needs to agree personal terms and pass a medical. It is believed out of loyalty to Leeds, the only team he would have joined was Manchester City and he has turned down approaches from other clubs. The 26-year-old will look to fill the void left by Fernandinho at City, who confirmed he will be leaving the club this summer after nine years with the club.
