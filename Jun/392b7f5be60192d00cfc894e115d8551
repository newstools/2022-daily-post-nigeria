The New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP, on Sunday debunked reports that its presidential candidate, Rabiu Kwankwaso would run for the 2023 presidential election as a running mate of the Labour Party’s candidate, Peter Obi. National Publicity Secretary of NNPP, Dr Agbo Major, who stated this in Abuja on Sunday, said contrary to reports, there was never a time such a discussion or negotiation was held between Kwankwaso and Obi. Agbo Major, however, admitted that there is an alliance talk with the Labour Party on how to rescue the country’s democracy from failing totally. He said, “NNPP has never at any time said its esteemed Presidential Candidate, His Excellency, Engr. Dr. Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso could accept to be Labour Party, Peter Obi’s deputy. “As a mass movement, NNPP acknowledged alliance talks with Labour Party that would consolidate and boost the nation’s frail democracy as we collectively strive for a new Nigeria which the party champions.“ Report currently making the rounds on social media indicates that Kwankwaso, a former Governor of Kano State may emerge as Obi’s running mate. But the NNPP spokesman described the report as fake, misleading, and embarrassing to the party and its supporters across the country. “The report is misleading and embarrassing to our great party, its Presidential candidate, Kwankwaso, and millions of supporters in Nigeria and in the diaspora, and urges journalists to crosscheck their reports before publishing them to avoid national disaffection ahead of the crucial 2023 general election”, he added.
