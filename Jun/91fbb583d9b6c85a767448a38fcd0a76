Golden Eaglets’ head coach, Nduka Ugbade, can’t hide his excitement after his side beat Burkina Faso to emerge champions of the WAFU B U-17 Championship on Friday night. The Eaglets won the keenly contested encounter 2-1 at the Cape Coast Stadium, Ghana. Ugbade’s boys’ success came five weeks after the Flying Eagles also won the WAFU B U-20 Championship in Niamey, Niger Republic. Nigeria took the lead on 22 minutes when Abubakar Abdullahi nodded home Emmanuel Micheal’s superb cross. The Burkinabes rallied back with Abdulramane Ouedraogo netting the equaliser three minutes before the break. Abdullahi, however, scored the winning goal two minutes into the second half. “I’m so happy for these boys, They really deserved this. We all work so hard to qualify for the U-17 AFCON and win this competition, “Ugbade said after the game. “We didn’t spend a long time in camp to prepare for this competition, but everyone was committed to us achieving our objective. “We will go home and rest and then focus on the AFCON. We will do our best to qualify for the World Cup too.” Golden Eaglets goalkeeper Richard Odoh was named Man of the Match after making a number of magnificent saves in the game.
