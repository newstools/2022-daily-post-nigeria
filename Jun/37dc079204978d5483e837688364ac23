The Labour Party (LP), on Monday, said that the party would not alter the principles of federal character in its choice of a vice presidential candidate. Barr. Julius Abure, Labour Party Chairman, made this known while speaking in commemoration of Democracy Day. Abure said the principle of social-religious inclusion and the diversity of the Nigerian workforce and membership of the Labour Party would not be compromised in its choice. He added that although the decision lies with its presidential candidate, Peter Obi, the party’s choice of a vice president will most likely come from the northern region. “While I want to say that it may be too premature for me to speak, and the constitution also gives the presidential candidate the right to nominate his vice presidential candidate, I feel it would be more proper for the presidential candidate to answer. “However, I want to assure you that as a party that is reasonable; as a party that believes in equity and justice; as a party that believes in social justice and equal opportunity for all, a vice-presidential candidate that is widely accepted, with powerful credentials, is most likely going to come from the Northern region, there is no doubt about that.”
