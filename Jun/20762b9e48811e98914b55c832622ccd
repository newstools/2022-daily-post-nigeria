Bandits reportedly killed three villagers and abducted a married woman from Bakiyawa village in Batagarawa Local Government Area of Katsina State. DAILY POST gathered that the villagers were killed by heavily armed bandits, numbering about 15, who stormed the community on Tuesday around 4pm riding on motorcycles. According to a source from the community, the hoodlums also shot one Usman Habibu of Ungwan Tantagaria in the same neighbourhood on the leg, who is currently receiving treatment in a hospital. Marwan Zayyana, a resident of the community said: “The hoodlums, armed with AK-47 rifles, started their operation from Ungwan Tsugune in Bakiyawa where they killed Sadiq Lawal inside his compound. “They proceeded to Ungwan Jageme where they also killed one Abubakar Musa right in front of his house. The third victim, Aminu Abdulwahab, was killed on his farmland while trying to escape from the marauding bandits.” Marwan noted that the community lately has been witnessing a series of attacks from the hoodlums. He recalled how barely a week ago, they attacked the community and abducted six villagers who are still in their captivity. “Similarly, another youth in the community was also kidnapped and he’s also yet to be released,” he said. However, Marwan noted that aside from those killed, injured and abducted, the assailants were not given room to rob the community of their valuables due to the resistance they encountered from youths in the community. As at the time of filing this report, the spokesperson of the Katsina Police Command, SP Gambo Isah, was yet to confirm the report.
