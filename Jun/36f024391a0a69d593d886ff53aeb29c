Manchester United on Thursday confirmed that Juan Mata would depart the club when his contract expires this summer. Man United disclosed this in a statement via its website on Thursday morning. DAILY POST reports that this is coming less than 24 hours after Man United confirmed Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard’s exit from Old Trafford. Mata, 34, joined Man United in January 2014 and went on to play 285 games, scoring 51 goals and winning four trophies. The Spanish midfielder made his final appearance for Man United in their Premier League defeat to Crystal Palace on the final day of the 2021/22 season. Meanwhile, outgoing Juventus star, Paulo Dybala, has decided that he is happy in Italy and would like to continue his career in the Serie A. Dybala said this on Wednesday after Argentina’s 3-0 victory over Italy in the Finalissima encounter at Wembley. The forward, who will leave Juventus this summer, has now insisted that he is very comfortable in Italy despite interest from Premier League clubs, Man United, Arsenal, Tottenham and Chelsea. Inter Milan are favourites to sign Dybala on a free transfer this summer. “I am quite calm, the people who work with me are taking care. In Italy, I am very comfortable,” Dybala tells ESPN about his future. “I would still like to know other leagues like the Premier League, LaLiga… but I’m happy in Italy.”
