Real Madrid’s new signing, Antonio Rudiger has named four players that make the Los Blancos very strong. Rudiger, who was Real Madrid’s first signing of the 2022/23 season, said the likes of Karim Benzema, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and Casemiro make the LaLiga champions very strong. The defender is currently on international duty with the German national team at the ongoing UEFA Nations League. Speaking ahead of his presentation, which is scheduled for June 20, Rudiger told MARCA he is motivated to do better at Real Madrid. He said, “It was a very welcoming conversation. He [Carlo Ancelotti] told me that everyone was very happy to have me in Madrid, and that makes me very happy. “It’s clear that Ancelotti is one of the people who make Real Madrid very strong, but he isn’t the only one. There are Karim Benzema, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric, Casemiro… He told me they were all very happy, and that makes me proud. “It also makes me realise that I have done well these last three years, and that gives me the motivation to do even better at Real Madrid.”
