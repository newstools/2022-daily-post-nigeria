Arsenal’s ex-midfielder, Mesut Ozil has stated he has no plans to leave Fenerbahce. Ozil insisted that he is determined to retire at his ‘childhood’ club, Fenerbahce, despite being excluded from the squad since March. The former Real Madrid star, who still has two years remaining on his contract, has not featured for the Turkey giants since he was suspended and has subsequently missed eight league games. Speaking on his future at the club, Ozil, in a series of tweets via his Twitter handle on Tuesday, said, “Recently, I have had to make a statement regarding the allegations made about my career. “I had completed my career goal by signing a 3.5-year contract with Fenerbahce, my childhood love, without even getting paid for the first 6 months. “I repeat with emphasis; I will not end my career in a team other than Fenerbahce. For the duration of my contract, my only goal is to sweat our Cubuklu jersey. This decision is very clear and final.”
