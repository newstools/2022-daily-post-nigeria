Borno State Governor, Babagana Zulum, on Thursday, congratulated All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu. Zulum also saluted President Muhammadu Buhari, APC national leaders and stakeholders for the successful conduct of the primaries. “Asiwaju’s antecedents as a freedom fighter for the entrenchment of democracy in Nigeria, which culminated into his founding role in the APC’s formation, makes his choice very unique for our party”, his statement reads. Zulum said the ex-Lagos Governor has many attributes, including “exceptional wisdom in identifying, nurturing and assembling talented persons regardless of their ethnic and religious identities”. He noted that Tinubu is also known to reward talented and productive persons by building them into becoming resourceful leaders as seen “across the Southwest and possibly beyond”. The Borno helmsman said the “uncommon trait has made Asiwaju to stand out in the community of leaders’ ‘. Zulum prayed that Allah makes “Asiwaju’s choice one that immensely benefits all Nigerians” regardless of where they live, their ethnicity, religion and political identities.
