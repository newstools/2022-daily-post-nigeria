Pastor Paul Enenche of Dunamis International Gospel Center, has likened the country’s current economic situation to glycogen storage disease. Enenche, who stated this at the just-concluded National Healing and Deliverance crusade in Abuja, organised by the church to seek the face of God ahead of the 2023 general elections, said most Nigerian problems are artificial. The popular clergy explained that, “In medicine, there is something we call Glycogen storage disease. It is a situation where what the body needs is there but the body is starving. “That is the current situation of our nation Nigeria. Starvation in the midst of enormous abundance and resources.” On the security challenges ravaging the entire nation, Pastor Enenche, declared God’s judgment on killers and their sponsors in Nigeria, saying the assailants would die the way they kill others. He decried how wasters criminal elements are arrested and “allowed to go scotfree” without being prosecuted, a development he described as very “sad and terrible.” “I have bad news for them, the nation shall be the burial ground for every killer and their sponsors in the land. I am so amazed that most of our people in this country behave as if everything is alright”, he added.
