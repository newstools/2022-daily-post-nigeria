Three suspected robbers have been apprehended by men of the Ondo State Police Command after robbing a commercial motorcyclist of his motorcycle in the state. The suspects, Victor Bright, 21, AbdulRahim Mohammed, 22, and Friday Emmanuel, 27, were arrested in Owo, for the crime. They snatched a Boxer motorcycle and a phone from their victim. The robbery was the gang’s first operation, according to the leader of the gang, Bright, who confessed to the crime when they were paraded at the state police headquarters. Bright claimed the motorcycle and phone were sold for N130,000, with one of the suspects on the run. “The phone was tracked to the person we sold it to and that was how we were arrested. Four of us were involved in the robbery but the fourth person ran away when we were arrested. “We sold the bike and the phone for N130,000. The four of us shared the money. We have finished spending the money. “I learned tailoring but at times, I engage in bricklaying jobs. That was my first time engaging in a robbery operation.” Meanwhile, the state’s Police Public Relations Officer, SP Funmi Odunlami, claimed that the suspect will be charged to court once the investigation is completed.
