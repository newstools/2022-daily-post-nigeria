Departing Real Madrid captain, Marcelo has revealed that the club’s former striker, Raul González, gave him gifts and many things when his son Enzo was born. Marcelo, who said he would never forget what Raul did to him, said this during his final press conference on Monday while paying a special tribute to the former Spain international during his emotional Real Madrid farewell ceremony. Raul was Real Madrid’s captain when Marcelo joined the LaLiga champions at the age of 18 from Brazilian side Fluminense. Marcelo has spent the last 15 years at Real Madrid after joining the club in 2007. During his time at Real Madrid, Marcelo has helped the team win 25 trophies, including six La Liga titles and five Champions Leagues. “Raul, capt, I want to thank you for the detail you’ve had with me,” the Brazilian left-back said. “When my son Enzo was born, you gave me a gift with many things for the baby and you gave me a lot of advice. “You were always very loving, you and your family. I’ll never forget that. “From there I began to see you as an example and I wanted to follow it. “I leave here being able to thank you for the strong example that you have been. “I have never said it before and I wanted to thank you in person.”
