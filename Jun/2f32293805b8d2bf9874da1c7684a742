Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello Presidential Campaign Organisation has faulted the emergence of Sen. Bola Tinubu as the Presidential flagbearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC). They stated this in a statement on Wednesday titled, ‘Yahaya Bello remains the hero of the oppressed’. In the statement issued by the group’s Director, Media and Publicity, Yemi Kolapo, he said the process that produced Tinubu as the APC Presidential candidate was highly “compromised” and “crooked”. DAILY POST reports that Bello was one of the contestants for the APC presidential ticket. However, Tinubu emerged as the party’s presidential candidate after polling 1,271 votes in the primary election of the ruling party held at the Eagles Square, Abuja, on Tuesday. He defeated former Minister of Transportation, Mr Chibuike Amaechi, who got 316 votes, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who polled 235 votes and others. The statement partly read, “The All Progressives Congress’ presidential primary elections have come and gone. The process was largely peaceful but highly compromised. “In this process, one leader stands out, according to the majority of Nigerians. “That leader, I say with all sense of fairness, is Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State. He’s the hero of this process and has made his point loud and clear to the admiration of even his worst enemies. “If there was a clear, desperate gang-up by northern governors and the leaders of a party against one person, and that person never for once disappointed his teeming supporters but rather fought to the very end, not minding the crooked process, then he should be celebrated by the constituency he represents – the youth.”
