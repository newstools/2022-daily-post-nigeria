Three men have been dragged before a Chief Magistrates’ Court in Ondo State for allegedly stealing and receiving properties worth N1,020,500. Ayodele Abel, 27, Dayo Samuel, 24, and Adetokunbo Adeniyi, 35, were charged with conspiring to steal and receive some of Adeyemi Micheal and Oluwasanmi Temidayo’s property. One gas cylinder worth N25,000, one Toshiba 45-inch television worth N150,000, a home theatre worth N500,000, a GOTV decoder worth N7,000, and two rechargeable fans worth N30,000 were among the items stolen. Other items include a carton-coloured school bag for N4,500, a poly star standing fan worth N45,000, an HP laptop worth N145,000, a battery lamp worth N2,000, a pair of shoes worth N12,000, and various types of cloth worth N100,000, for a total value of N1,020,500:00. On Wednesday, the trio was charged with six counts of conspiracy, breaking, stealing, and receiving things. They committed the offence on June 6, 2022, at about 3:15 am at harmony estate, life road, Ondo, according to the police prosecutor, Mr Akao Moremi. However, they pleaded not guilty to the accusations brought against them. Moremi told the court that he would bring five prosecution witnesses to testify in the case and that he needed a date to read the case file. The defendants’ lawyers, Otunba F.W Akindiose and Oluwatobiloba Adeyeri applied for bail in the most generous terms possible. Mrs Charity Adeyanju, the presiding magistrate, granted the defendants bail in the amount of N2 million, with two sureties each in the same amount. As a result, Adeyanju adjourned the case’s hearing until July 26, 2022.
