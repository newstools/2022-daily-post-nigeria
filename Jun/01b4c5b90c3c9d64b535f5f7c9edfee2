The three clubs Napoli striker, Victor Osimhen, could join this summer have been revealed. Osimhen has been linked with a move away from Napoli this summer. The Nigerian international has already revealed he will decide on his future later this summer amid transfer interest from Arsenal, Manchester United and Real Madrid. Osimhen is rated at around £85million and he is highly coveted after scoring 18 goals in 32 appearances last season for Napoli. The former Lille star admitted to CalcioMercato that he knows ‘many people’ would like to sign him – but vowed to decide after going on holiday. The report added that Arsenal have made a bid of £51m for Osimhen. Osimhen said: “I know there are many people that would like me in Spain or England, but I don’t think it’s the right time to talk about it now that I’m with the national team. “I don’t know my future, I know anything can happen, but now I just want to go on holiday with my family, clear my head and recharge my batteries. Then we’ll take care of everything else.”
