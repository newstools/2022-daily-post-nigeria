Sen. Bola Tinubu, a former Governor of Lagos State, has said as the country marks this year’s Democracy Day, the spirit of June 12 would expand to become the spirit of Nigeria and national greatness of their dreams. He said Nigerians should remember and honour June 12 because the election in 1993 remains one of the best elections Nigeria had seen. Tinubu, the flagbearer of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 general election, disclosed this in a statement by his media aide, Mr Tunde Rahman, in Lagos on Saturday. DAILY POST reports that the Federal Government had declared Monday as a public holiday to mark the event. June 12 was declared democracy day by the current administration to celebrate Chief MKO Abiola’s win in the presidential election of June 12, 1993. Tinubu said: “Just like democracy finally won against dictatorship, I know that prosperity shall overcome poverty, peace shall outlast violence, compassion will conquer hatred and good will defeat evil. “Justice, security and economic development will visit and reside in every hamlet, household, village, and city in our nation. “The spirit of June 12 shall expand to become the spirit of Nigeria and our national greatness and destiny. “My prayer, on this day, is that people from all walks of life and all parts of the country unite to build a more industrious and peaceful society such that all Nigerians may enjoy a greater future.” Tinubu added that Nigerians should never treat this day as just another holiday on the yearly calendar. According to him, “we must remember why June 12 is Democracy Day and why all Nigerians should honour it.” Tinubu noted that the June 12, 1993 election would remain the freest and fairest election Nigeria had experienced up to that moment and it yet remains as one of the best elections the nation had seen.
