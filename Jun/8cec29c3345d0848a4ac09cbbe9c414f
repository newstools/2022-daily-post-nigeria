There is tension around the Jakande Estate at Isolo, Isheri Road, and environs in Lagos. On Thursday, a motorcycle (okada) rider hit a passerby who died within some minutes. In a swift reaction, residents trooped out in anger and attacked bikes plying the routes. The protesters set a number of them on fire. The operators are now avoiding the area for their safety. The police have assured that officers are on ground to ensure the safety of lives and normalcy in activities. Police Public Relations Officer, Benjamin Hundeyin confirmed that the rider “veered off the road and hit a pedestrian”. “Unfortunately, the pedestrian fell and died on the spot. People around decided to lynch the motorcycle rider.” The spokesman said the police arrived at the scene on time and rescued the accused from the lynching. A team of officers then took him to the hospital for treatment and evacuated the deceased. Hundeyin added that before the police returned, “an angry mob was already burning the motorcycles left behind by the fleeing riders. “The Lagos State Police Command condemns jungle justice in very strong terms”, he said. The PPRO warned that anyone found engaging in such would be dealt with in accordance with the law.
