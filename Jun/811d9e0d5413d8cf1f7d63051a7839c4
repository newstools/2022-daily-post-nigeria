Shehu Sani, a former Kaduna Central Senator has called on the founder of Household of God Church, Reverend Chris Okotie to revive his Fresh Democratic Party. Sani was reacting to Okotie’s call that all 2023 presidential aspirants should step down and allow him emerge as interim president. The popular gospel preacher decried the imbalance in the government of Nigeria. Reverend Okotie, a former presidential aspirant spoke to journalists in Lagos while celebrating his 63rd birthday. His appeal was specifically addressed to Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), and Peter Obi, the flagbearer of the Labour Party (LP). Reacting, Sani faulted Okotie for asking that presidential candidates should step down for him. In a tweet, the former lawmaker wrote: “Pastor Chris Okotie shouldn’t be telling the Presidential candidates to step down for him. He should just revive his Fresh Democratic Party and enter the ring.”
