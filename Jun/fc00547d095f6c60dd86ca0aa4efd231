Randers sporting director, Soren Pedersen has confirmed Glasgow rivals, Rangers and Celtic, are trying to sign Nigerian forward, Stephen Odey from the club. Odey caught the eye after impressing in the Danish Superliga and UEFA Europa Conference League last season. The 24-year-old bagged 13 goals in 32 games across all competitions for Randers last season. “It is certainly not so concrete that I have an offer,” Pedersen was quoted by Daily Record. “That could easily happen. There are many clubs that have shown interest in him because he is a good player. But there is nothing concrete from there. “We’re happy with him and it’s not something where we’re saying he should be sold in this window. He has a great sporting value, so if we say yes to something, it must be both the right club and the right amount.” Odey moved to Randers from Belgian Pro League club, KRC Genk on loan last summer. Randers triggered the purchase option in the contract on November 21, 2021 after he scored five goals in seven games.
