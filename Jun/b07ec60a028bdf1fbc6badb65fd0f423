The Northern Christian Elders Forum (NOSCEF), on Friday, warned against Muslim-Muslim, Christians- Christians President ticket being rumoured in some quarters. NOSCEF President, Ejoga Oyinehi Inalegwu, while congratulating former Vice President Atiku Abubakar of the PDP, and Bola Tinubu of APC, for winning presidential primaries, urged the party flag bearers to consider the country’s diversity while choosing their running mates Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), had urged all party’s presidential flag bearers to submit the names of their running mate However, NOSCEF on Friday said a Muslim-Muslim, and Christian-Christian ticket would be insensitive and appealed to all patriotic Presidential candidates to polarize the nation along religious lines as Nigerians are looking forward, with great expectations for a new dawn, come 2023. It appealed to political parties to be sensitive to the mood of the nation, and the religious diversity of its people and to show patriotism by avoiding any action that will throw up the lines of the divide, merely to win elections rather than steps that will unite the country. The group advised politicians to make deliberate efforts to avoid playing the religious cards through such tickets and not turn around to accuse those who condemn their unpatriotic actions as the culprits.
