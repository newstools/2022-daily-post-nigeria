The Governor of Nasarawa state, Abdullahi Sule, has claimed that President Muhammadu Buhari has spoken about the kind of candidate he wants to be the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress. Sule stated this while speaking on Channels Television on Tuesday night. However, he insisted that Buhari did not suggest any name to the Governors elected on the platform of the APC. “The president said that our consensus candidate must be somebody that is acceptable to Nigerians. Somebody who knows what APC is about. “Somebody who must go to every part of the country and be accepted. Someone who can win the elections. “But if you are looking for a name, the president did not mention a name, neither did anybody mention. “Buhari has asked us to think about it while he is away in Spain. He will also consult with stakeholders and the aspirants themselves. At the end of the day, we must remain a united party,” he said. When asked if he has any candidate in mind, Sule replied: “For me, I have not even begun thinking about it. I will go back and sit down with stakeholders, consult and make a decision.”
