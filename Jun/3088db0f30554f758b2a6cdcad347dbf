Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, has lamented the inability of the present government to tackle the security challenges rocking the nation. In a series of tweets on Tuesday night, the human rights lawyer recalled the administration of the former President, Olusegun Obasanjo which fought criminal elements and ensured peace in the country. According to him, the days of good leadership are gone, stressing that, except, Nigerians, through hard work, establish better government in the 2023 general elections. He wrote, “One thing you cannot take from OBJ is that he fought for Nigerians. If it was OBJ that was President when Nigerians were being killed like flies in South Africa there would have been consequences. If it was OBJ that was in power when Morrocons and Libyans were humiliating. “Torturing and killing our people there would have been a price to pay. During the OBJ/Atiku Govt. Nigerians all over the world held their heads up in pride and knew that they had a President and Government that would not allow them to be pushed around or be intimidated. “Sadly those days are gone and unless we work very hard and get the right leadership they may have gone forever”.
