A ravaging flood, which followed a heavy downpour in Owerri, Imo State, on Tuesday evening, reportedly swept away a young lady, simply identified as Ada Adiele from Abia State. DAILY POST gathered that the unfortunate incident occurred at Imo State University Junction axis along Okigwe road, Owerri. An eye witness while making a distress call about the flood incident at the incident scene called for a search and rescue operation for the missing lady. Our correspondent saw a video clip where one of the shop owners who reported the incident said the victim fell into a flooded ditch/gutter on Tuesday evening after the road was submerged by a flood. He said they were able to identify her as Ada Adiele with her Zenith Bank ATM card which fell off her hand. He enjoined residents of the state to look out for the body of the lady. Reacting to the development, the Acting Commandant of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) in Imo State, Mr Chukwuemeka N Odinmba said the incident happened around 1600 hours. He said its personnel rescued a young lady, reportedly swept away by the heavy downpour in Owerri on Tuesday evening. The commandant said the task was done in collaboration with other stakeholders who provided assistance to the victim. According to him, “The lady is a visitor in Owerri capital of Imo State. The flood carried her all the way from the popular IMSU Junction to the NSCDC junction where some personnel saw her struggling in the flood before intervening to rescue the almost dead lady out of the flood with a few other good-spirited Nigerians. The Acting Commandant said, “you can imagine what she must have passed through before being rescued. At the moment she is still at the Life Spring Hospital Owerri where she is being revived.”
