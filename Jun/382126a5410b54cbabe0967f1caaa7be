Mr. Wilson Iliya Yangye, the former Senior Special Assistant, Political, Office of the Deputy Governor of Kaduna State, has dumped the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). He has officially defected to the opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Yangye contested to represent Jamaa Constituency at the State House of Assembly in 2019 but lost to the incumbent member with a narrow margin when he joined the ruling All Progressives Congress sometime in 2018. Shortly after the 2019 general elections, Yangye was appointed the Senior Special Assistant Political, Office of the Deputy Governor until he resigned his appointment this year based on personal grounds. He has been a dedicated APC member, who has contributed a lot to the victory of the party in Jema’a Local Government Area during the last local government elections which led to the breaking of the 22-year jinx of the PDP rule in the local government area.
