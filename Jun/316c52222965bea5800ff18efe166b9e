New Bayern Munich signing, Sadio Mane, has told Liverpool that he would return to the club in the near future. Mane left Liverpool to join Bayern Munich on a three-year deal. The Senegalese international was officially unveiled as a Bayern Munich player on Wednesday. Speaking to Liverpool’s official website, Mane said, “For sure, I think whoever is leaving Liverpool, with those supporters, you will always miss them because so far [they are] the best in the world and I have always said it. “Especially when [they sing] my name, ‘Mane! Running down the wing!’ – I don’t know, I can’t sing very well! Of course, I really enjoyed the time and they, wow… how can I say it? He added: “Playing at Anfield I think, always gives you so much power because of the fans. So, for sure, I am going to miss you guys, but anyway, I love you guys. “I still have my house in Liverpool and everything so for sure I will come back, of course, and I would love one day to come back to Anfield to say hi to them and of course to watch Liverpool playing because for me, I am going to be Liverpool’s No.1 fan – after the supporters!” Mane joined Liverpool from Southampton back in 2016.
