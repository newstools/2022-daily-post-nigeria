Chelsea director, Marina Granovskaia, is set to leave the club this summer despite new owner Todd Boehly’s attempts to keep her, BILD reports. Granovskaia has been a close ally of former owner Roman Abramovich for more than 20 years and was described as his de facto ‘chief of staff. She represented Abramovich at Chelsea after he bought the club and was appointed to the board in 2013, becoming a key figurehead. The Russian-Canadian has been responsible for overseeing the football side of the club operation, including player contracts, managerial appointments and dismissals, and transfers. Boehly had spoken to both Granovskaia and chairman Bruce Buck about remaining in west London. But while Buck will continue in his role, Granovskaia has decided to leave at the end of August. Chelsea is already looking to bring in Andrea Berta, who is currently the sporting director at Spanish side Atletico Madrid. Berta helped build a team that won LaLiga in the 2020/2021 season.
