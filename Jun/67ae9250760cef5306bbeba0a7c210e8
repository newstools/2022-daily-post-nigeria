The Emir of Ilorin, Ibrahim Sulu Gambari, has expressed grief over the death of Dr Abdulhameed Shuaib Agaka. Alhaji Gambari recalled benefitting immensely from the late cleric’s preachings about Islam and Holy Quran. The monarch also disclosed that his mother, at a tender age, learnt about the Holy Qur’an from Agaka. The deceased, 77, was the father of PRNigeria publisher and Editor-in-Chief, Yushau Shuaib. On Monday, Emir Gambari hosted a delegation of the family led by Daudu Agaka, Alhaji Hanafi Kawu. The traditional ruler told them to take solace in the deceased’s fulfilled, unblemished and righteous life. “Kwara and Nigeria have lost an iconic Islamic preacher of unrivalled acclaim. The family is synonymous with Islamic evangelism and crusade. “The late Abdulhameed remains one of the greatest Arabic Islamic scholars produced by the Emirate”, the monarch said. Agaka attended School for Arabic Studies (SAS) in Kano, and Bayero University Kano (BUK), where he obtained a Ph.D in Qur’anic Morphology and Arabic Grammar. The late Sheikh taught Arabic and Islamic Studies at Kano Educational Development Centre (KEDC) between 1971 and 1974. He was the Head of Arabic Studies Departments at School for Arabic Studies; Women Arabic Teachers College; Aminu Kano College of Islamic and Legal Studies, among others.
