Former Arsenal striker, Kevin Campbell, has advised the club against signing Real Madrid star Marco Asensio this summer, insisting that he doesn’t see where he is going to fit in at the Gunners. Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, is on the lookout for attacking reinforcements for his team, who faltered in the latter stages of the Premier League last season. Arteta’s side finished fourth in the league, having been in pole position to claim the fourth spot and qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 2016. But Campbell believes Arteta should not go in for Asensio, 26, this summer as he believes they already possess options in his position. Asked if Arteta was a necessary signing given the likes of Bukayo Saka, Emile Smith-Rowe and Martin Odegaard being at Arsenal, Campbell told Football Insider, “Not really. I don’t see much sense in that one if I am honest. “Asensio is a very good player. He has been an excellent squad player at Real Madrid. Whenever he has come in, he has done a job. He has not let anybody down.” He added: “He knows where the goal is and has a sweet left foot. I don’t see where he is going to fit in at Arsenal, though. For me, that one will amount to nothing more. I can’t see him coming.”
