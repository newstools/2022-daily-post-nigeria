Liverpool legend, Mark Lawrenson has accused UEFA and the French police of treating the club’s fans like animals during the chaos which marred Saturday’s Champions League final in Paris. Recall that several supporters were attacked with tear-gas and pepper-spray before and after the Champions League final between Liverpool, while the police also did nothing to help fans of both teams who were subjected to muggings and knife attacks by local youths. The French authorities have blamed the incident on Liverpool fans struggling to get into the stadium on fake tickets, calling it a ‘massive fraud at an industrial level’. But Lawrenson, who made over 350 appearances for Liverpool during his time at Anfield, insisted fault lay with the authorities, adding that they didn’t like the Premier League giant. “They don’t like us. That is the bottom line and it was just a case of them thinking, ‘Some of these are animals, so let’s treat them like animals’. “They know there are 20,000 people coming in and they also know that supporters are there two or three hours before the game these days, having food and drink and soaking up the great atmosphere. And they have just gone, ‘You know what, this is Liverpool, there is always a problem’. In fact, they were a bigger problem than any Liverpool supporter,” Lawrenson was quoted by Daily Mail as saying. “I see UEFA have changed their statement already. What a shock that is,” he added.
