Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has made a mistake in selling forward Gabriel Jesus to Arsenal, according to former Liverpool player, Dietmar Hamann. Jesus made the £45 million switch from Man City to Arsenal earlier this week and has completed his medical at the North London club. The Brazilian is expected to put pen to paper on a five-year contract at Arsenal, as he looks to get regular starting time after failing to hold down a starting spot under Guardiola at Man City. But Hamann has warned that losing Jesus, 25, could be very costly for Guardiola. “Pep Guardiola is making a mistake by letting Gabriel Jesus leave,” Hamann told Genting Casino. “Erling Haaland has had his injury problems and the Premier League is a very physical league.”
