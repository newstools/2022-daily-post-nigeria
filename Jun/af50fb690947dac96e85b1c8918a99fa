Journalists accredited for the coverage of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Special Convention in Abuja have been denied entry by security agents at the Eagle Square venue of the event. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that dozens of journalists who had gathered at the entrance were barred by the security agents who claimed to be acting on orders from the above. Canisters of tear gas were fired at the journalists by the security agents who stood their ground on preventing the journalists even with their accreditation tags. Meanwhile, seven presidential aspirants contesting under the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have rejected the five names that were purportedly submitted to President Muhammadu Buhari to select a consensus candidate. They insisted nobody consulted them before the governors arrived at the decision.
