Nigeria’s Golden Eaglets started their campaign at the WAFU B U-17 Championship on a resounding note outclassing hosts Ghana 4-2 at the Cape Coast Stadium on Saturday night. Emmanuel Michael set the Golden Eaglets on their way to the impressive win with a sublime free-kick on 12 minutes. Nduka Ugbade’s boys maintained their dominance afterward with Precious Williams adding the second off a rebound three minutes before the break. The pattern of the game continued after the break with Jubril Azeez netting the third goal for Nigeria in the 53rd minute. The hosts were handed a lifeline five minutes later as Abdul Razak Salifu reduced the deficit with a cool finish. Light Ike restored Nigeria’s three-goal advantage by firing home from inside the box in the 78th minute. The home team were awarded a penalty three minutes from time which was converted by Collins Agyemang. The Golden Eaglets will take on Togo in their next game in the competition next week Tuesday.
