Kogi State Governor and a presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Yahaya Bello, Borno state governor, Babagana Zullum, and their Zamfara state counterpart, Bello Matawalle have arrived at Eagle Square. Recall that the ruling party has been riddled with controversy over the purported endorsement of Senate President, Ahmad Lawan as the consensus candidate. Also, in spite of the APC Northern governors’ decision that the presidential ticket should be ceded to the south, the Kogi governor has refused to step down.
