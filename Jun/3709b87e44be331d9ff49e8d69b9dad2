The Osun State Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Prince Gboyega Famodun, has condemned the attack on some members of the party in Ilesa-West Local Government Council Area of the state, by some suspected political thugs. DAILY POST reported that some hoodlums suspected to be political thugs attacked and disrupted the collection of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) by people in Ilesa West Local Government Area of Osun State on Thursday. Famodun in a statement issued by his Media Adviser, Kola Olabisi, in Osogbo, described the attack as needless, wicked, primitive, callous and a development which poses danger to the nation’s democratic governance. The APC alleged that a notorious thug, Dada Ojo, led the attack, accompanied by the PDP candidate for the state House of Assembly in the 2023 election, Wale Akerele Also known as Water; Elewedu Lekan; Lima Abiola, Rotimi Abu and Denjuwon. The party alleged that eight vehicles branded for PDP conveying hoodlums carrying guns, cutlasses and other dangerous weapons, invaded Isale-Gbogi in Ward 3 Collation Centre. The chairman queried why the collection of PVCs should culminate in attacks by political parties. He, however, cautioned the PDP against igniting violence. Warning the PDP leaders in the state to call their people to order to maintain peace before, during and after the July 16, governorship election, Famodun also enjoined security agencies in the state to investigate the inhuman approach to the election process by political thugs.
