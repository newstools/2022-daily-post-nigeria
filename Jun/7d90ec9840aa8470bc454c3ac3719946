The Court of Appeal in Abuja on Monday restrained the National Assembly from imposing statutory delegates at the All Progressives Congress (APC) convention. Justice Haruna Tsammani also restrained the enforcement of a Federal judgement delivered on June 3 granting the enforcement of amended of Section 84(8) of the Electoral Act, 2022. The ex parte application by APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu was filed by A. A. Popoola and Karma Fagbemi. The lawyers prayed the appellate court to stay the execution of the High Court verdict delivered by Justice A. M. Liman in suit number FHC/KN/CS/137/2022. It permitted Senator Mas’ud El-Jibrin Doguwa, Hon. Habila Sani, Hon. Bilyaminu Yusuf Shinkafi, the Senate, the House of Representatives and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to enforce the amendment. Furthermore, Justice Tsammani directed the service of processes of the order by substituted means against the parties in the matter. The judge adjourned hearing of the motion on notice for stay of execution to June 9. Adamu argued that Section 84(8) of the Electoral Act on statutory delegates’ participation in the primary was in conflict with Section 223 of the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 and Article 20(iv) of the APC Constitution. He further contended that the suit was filed in Kano on May 24 without joining of the Attorney General of the Federation, the Chief Law Officer of the Federation.
