The self-acclaimed leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu has slammed a fresh suit against the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, Justice John Terhamba Tsoho, over the adoption of a secret trial policy in the criminal charges brought against him by the Federal Government. The Chief Judge was sued alongside the Chief Registrar of the court at the Federal High Court, Abuja in which the detained Kanu is seeking an order of the court to void the secret trial policy on the ground that it is invalid, unlawful, and unconstitutional. The suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/556/2022 was instituted on his behalf by Ifeanyi Ejiofor, one of the counsels in his defense team. Kanu predicated his objection to a secret trial on the ground that the policy violated his fundamental rights under section 36 of the 1999 Constitution and Section 34 of the Terrorism Prevention Act 2011.
