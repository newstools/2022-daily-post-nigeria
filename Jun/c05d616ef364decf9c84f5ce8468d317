The Academic Staff Union of Universities, Yobe State University Branch, (ASUU-YSU), has vowed to continue with the national strike, while pressing for the settlement of its local demands. This was part of resolutions reached at the end of an emergency congress meeting held on Friday in Damaturu by the Branch. Dr. Mohammed S. Jajere, branch Chairperson in a statement, noted that the meeting was held to review the on-going national strike vis-a-vis the recent release by the University Governing Council. “The branch joined the ongoing national strike as a chartered member of ASUU not on solidarity basis as misleadingly quoted by the council. “That none of the lingering branch issues (as contained in our earlier resolution of 10 May, 2022) was attended neither by the University management nor the State Government, contrary to the claim of the Council”, the Chairperson said. According to Jajere, the congress warned ASUU members from other universities violating the strike action in whatever form will be reported to their respective branches for appropriate sanctions. “Members should desist from signing any kind of work resumption register as directed by the council. “The management of the university should avoid any form of intimidation and victimisation targeted at members of our union in exercising their fundamental rights. “Parents are advised not to send their wards back to the University as such could amount to waste of resources”, he warned. Recall that, Governor Mai Mala Buni and the University’s Governing Council had separately appealed to ASUU-YSU Branch to call-off the national strike in view of Yobe State’s peculiar challenges occasioned by years of Boko Haram insurgency.
