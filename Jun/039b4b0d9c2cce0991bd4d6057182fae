Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Ondo, Most Reverend Jude Arogundade, has described as “madness” the attack on worshippers by gunmen suspected to be bandits. According to the Bishop, who visited the scene of the incident, the attack is an indication that the country is at war. Gunmen suspected to be bandits had on Sunday morning invaded Saint Francis Catholic Church, Owo in Owo Local Government where scores of worshippers were killed. https://dailypost.ng/2022/06/05/many-feared-dead-as-gunmen-attack-church-in-gov-akeredolus-hometown/ Arogundade maintained that all over the world there is nowhere people will slaughter babies, children, husbands and wives worshipping on Pentecost day. He added that those who were running out were being shot from outside while those who were inside were shot inside. “They threw dynamite at the altar to blow it down to the sanctuary. Only the evil ones are capable of such desecration. “Probably what the rest of the world should know is that Nigeria is at war, and this type of war is geared towards civilians. “I’m not sure what point someone is trying to make with this kind of cruelty, but whatever point they were trying to make, they have failed miserably,” he said.
