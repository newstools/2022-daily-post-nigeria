Presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, Friday, received the party’s Certificate of Return. Recall that a faction of the party earlier in the week elected Mr Ambassador Jude Ezenwafor as the party’s presidential candidate. The decision of the faction triggered reactions as Obi’s supporters across the country asked Ezenwafor to step down with immediate effect. The Independent National Electoral Commission on Thursday affirmed the former governor of Anambra, as the authentic presidential candidate of the Labour Party. Similarly, the Nigeria Labour Congress also stated that it recognises only Obi’s faction of the party. Ezenwafor, however, bowed to pressure on Thursday and announced his withdrawal from the presidential race.
