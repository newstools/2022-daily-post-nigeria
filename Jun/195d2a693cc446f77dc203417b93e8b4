Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State on Friday said he is not an emperor, in what could be seen as a reaction to the jab by Bola Tinubu, an All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential aspirant. Abiodun stressed that he is holding his position in trust for the people of Ogun State. Referring to a comment by Tinubu about him, the governor said he had vowed to be fair, just, and equitable. He tweeted: “I am not an emperor by any chance and this is not my family inheritance. “I am holding this position in trust for all the people of this state, and I have vowed to be fair, just, and equitable and this is the solemn agreement I made between the Almighty God and myself.” Tinubu had thrown a jab at Abiodun during his meeting with APC delegates yesterday in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. The APC National Leader said Abiodun could not have become the Governor of Ogun State without him. According to Tinubu, his efforts gave Abiodun an edge over the then Governor Ibikunle Amosun, who refused to support Abiodun over the controversies that arose after the party’s primary election ahead of the 2019 general elections. It appears Tinubu was not pleased with the fact that Abiodun is supporting Vice President Yemi Osinbajo’s presidential ambition. Abiodun had told Osinbajo when he visited Ogun recently that he would support him for being instrumental to his emergence as the Governor of the Gateway State in 2019, stressing that he is not an ingrate. But Tinubu, while speaking in Abeokuta, said the Governor should thank God and him for his victory at the polls. Referring to the governor, Tinubu said, “This one sitting behind me here, could he have become Governor without me? We were at the stadium, they tore all his posters. Even the party flag, they didn’t want to hand it over to him; I was the one who brought it. “If he wants to meet God at the right place, he must know that without God and me, he would not have become Governor.”
