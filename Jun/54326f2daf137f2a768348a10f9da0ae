Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) Oyo State chapter has called for the implementation of the Consolidated Legislative Salary Structure (CONLESS) for legislative staff in the State. The concerned workers made this demand on Monday. They explained that the implementation of CONLESS was long overdue. The leadership of the union during an emergency meeting with the Speaker of the State House of Assembly, Adebo Ogundoyin, said the House had already passed the legislative autonomy bill which was also assented to by Governor Seyi Makinde. PASAN Chairman, Comrade Yemi Alade, while speaking, said that the workers will embark on strike if the implementation of CONLESS was not done as expected. Alade added that the consolidated salary structure was already being enjoyed by the Health and Environmental workers in the State. However, the Speaker, Ogundoyin, appealed to the workers to be calm. He said that the issue will be resolved soon. He also assured the workers that the leadership of the House, representatives of the council and the management staff will meet with the Governor on the matter this week. He appealed to the workers not to embark on strike. Ogundoyin said the demand for the implementation of CONLESS by the Oyo State House of Assembly staff was not out of place. He assured that the lawmakers will do everything to ensure that a reasonable percentage is effected for the benefit of the staff.
