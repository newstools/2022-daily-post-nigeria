Liverpool winger, Mohamed Salah, has won the Professional Footballers’ Association (PFA) Player of the Year for the second time. Salah finished joint top scorer in the Premier League alongside Tottenham Hotspur’s Son Heung-Min with 23 goals. He also recorded 13 assists as he helped Liverpool to finish second in the league, as well as winning the Carabao Cup and FA Cup. “This one is a really good one to win, especially because it’s voted by players. “It shows you that you’ve worked really hard and you get what you worked for. I have my room with trophies in a cabinet and I made sure that I had another space for one more,” Salah said in a statement. Salah won the prestigious Football Writers’ Association (FWA) Footballer of the Year award in April, but was pipped by City’s Kevin De Bruyne to the Premier League’s Player of the Year award.
