Rev. Fr Kelvin Ugwu, a Nigerian Catholic Priest serving in Malawi, has alleged that the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, gave its presidential ticket to someone who supported the killing of Deborah Samuel. Deborah, a female student in Sokoto State was lynched over alleged blasphemy against Prophet Mohammed last month. DAILY POST recalls that the former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, who clinched the PDP presidential ticket, had trended on social media for pulling down posts on his handles which condemned the killing. The PDP presidential candidate, who swiftly condemned the lynching of the 200 level student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, deleted the posts from Facebook and Twitter after some Northern followers threatened to withdraw their support for his presidential ambition. Fr Kelvin, in a post on his verified Facebook page on Thursday, described the main opposition party as evil for giving Atiku its presidential ticket. The clergy also called on Nigerian youths to ensure that they get the election right in 2023, stressing that Nigerians need to take power from the tyrants. He said, “If Nigeria doesn’t get it right this time around, Nigeria will NEVER NEVER get it right again. This is not a curse nor is it a prophecy. “The reason is that anytime you get it right, you are feeding the common masses. Anytime you get it wrong, you are feeding your Tyrants. “PDP never said anything to Atiku for choosing the northern fundamentalists over the life of Ms Deborah Emmanuel whom they killed and burnt in Sokoto. What PDP did was to reward a supporter of murderers as their flag bearer. “There is no better way to put it, PDP in itself is evil. They are your Tyrants. If you see their logo, avoid putting your precious thumbprint there”.
