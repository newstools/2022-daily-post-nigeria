Former Newcastle United star, Darren Ambrose has said that Neymar cannot play at Tottenham. Following rumours he wants to leave Paris Saint-Germain, most clubs are not queuing up for the Brazilian’s signature. Ambrose said that while many clubs would jump at the chance to sign the Brazil international, Tottenham will never go for him. RMC Sport reports that the only clubs who could afford the Brazilian are Manchester United, Chelsea and Newcastle should he leave. Ambrose pointed out that Tottenham boss, Antonio Conte will inevitably clash with Neymar and that the forward would struggle for game time in north London. Asked if he’d have Neymar at Tottenham, Ambrose said: “No, I wouldn’t. “I don’t think he’d play to be honest. I don’t think he’d get on with Antonio Conte. “I’m not saying it because of his ability, he’s a talented footballer, I’m saying it because of what I think he’d bring to Tottenham.”
