Former Super Eagles coach, Sunday Oliseh, has said Wilfred Ndidi is a better defensive midfielder than John Mikel Obi. Oliseh stated while speaking on the Athlst Podcast, Special Delivery with Emmanuel Babayaro and Matthew Edafe. He insisted he never saw Mikel Obi as an offensive midfielder, despite him playing in an advanced role at the 2005 World Youth Championship. “He’s a player who’s done some good with Chelsea. But when you talk about playing as an offensive midfielder, he’s not an offensive midfielder. “My man here knows I’m blunt to say certain things. “Offensive midfielders have certain qualities and he doesn’t have any of them. As regards as a defensive midfielder, I think he’s useful but I won’t play him. “I’ll play Ndidi because a defensive midfielder’s work is- you have to win balls without making fouls, you have to be very good at aerial balls. You have to have some control by helping others,” Oliseh said.
