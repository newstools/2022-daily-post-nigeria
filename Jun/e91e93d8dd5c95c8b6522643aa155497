Gunmen have abducted a former Commissioner in Adamawa State and demanded N30 million ransom from his family. Babangida Abubakar Idris, a Commissioner for Housing and Urban Planning during the immediate past government (of Governor Jibrilla Bindow), was kidnapped in the early hours of Tuesday. DAILY POST gathered from sources close to the family on Wednesday, that the kidnappers who kept the family in the dark for long hours finally made their ransom demand of N30 million. The sources said the kidnappers had on Tuesday surrounded the home of the victim at Bajabure, a hilly community in the Girei local government area near the state capital, Yola. The kidnappers shot the former Commissioner in the foot and wounded some others around the household before making away with him. “What is now worrisome is that there was also an attack during the last APC primaries when the victim escaped an attack by yet-to-be-identified persons who ended up smashing the victim’s windscreen,” said a family member. Confirming the kidnapping of Babangida Idris, the state Police Command spokesman, SP Suleiman Nguroje said the police had taken measures to tackle the issue. He expressed optimism that operatives of the command would get at the suspects and release the former Commissioner unconditionally.
