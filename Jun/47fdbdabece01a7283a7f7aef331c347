Chief Victor Umeh, the former National Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), has given the reason for defecting to the Labour Party. Umeh spoke at a press conference held at the Secretariat of the Anambra Council of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Awka. He said that he dumped APGA because of an alleged conspiracy against him by some party members in the state. Umeh emerged the LP candidate for Anambra Central Senatorial District in the 2023 general elections, after leaving APGA. “During the last senatorial primary election, which I contested under APGA, it was glaring that some people within the party perfectly wheeled conspiracy to pull me down. “That was why I decided to leave APGA,” he said. He further said that he joined LP on the advice of the party’s Presidential Candidate, Mr Peter Obi. He expressed delight over his movement to LP, saying that the decision had reunited him with Obi. He recalled how Obi and himself steered the ship of APGA to victory and opined that a similar fate was about to repeat itself in LP. “Nigerians from all shades of opinion want Peter Obi as president in 2023 and what is happening in LP is divine. “What is driving him are statements he makes on the management of the resources of the country. “These truly represent his conduct on the ways public resources should be managed,” Umeh said. He urged Obi’s supporters to ensure they obtained their permanent voter cards ahead of the elections to enable the country witness a progressive era.
