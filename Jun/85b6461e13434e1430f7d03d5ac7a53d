The police command in Ondo has cautioned residents against raising false alarms in any part of the state. The police command said the rate at which the negative trend is turning out in the state was fast becoming a habit. It was gathered that the command’s position is coming on the backdrop of the rumoured kidnap of school children in some parts of the state. In a statement by the police spokesperson in the state, SP Funmilayo Odunlami, the Command will not allow any alarmist put unnecessary fear in the heart of the people. “The Command is miffed at the rate at which people sit in their comfort zone and cause the Police and the public undue stress.” Odunlami expressed dismay that within 24 hours, two false alarms had been raised in the state. She further maintained that such acts are unhealthy for the mental health of the people due to the past security incidents in the state. The PPRO added that the Commissioner of Police, Oyeyemi Adesoye Oyediran, has ordered a thorough investigation into the development. The command also warned the suspected alarmists to desist or face the full wrath of the law “as the Command will not fold its hand and allow such evil fester within the State.”
