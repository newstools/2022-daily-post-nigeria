Bayern Munich are set to hand new boy Sadio Mane the No10 shirt. Mane’s father, Souleymane, has said Leroy Sane, who currently wears the shirt, will have no problems if he is asked to relinquish it. Souleymane told Radio Futurs Medias: “Sadio Mane is known with the number 10 at Liverpool and the national team – while at Bayern my son wears it. “If Sadio wants the number 10, I’m certain there would be no problem for Leroy to give it to him.” Mane left Liverpool for the Bundesliga champions in a deal worth up to £35m. The 30-year-old has signed a contract until 2025.
