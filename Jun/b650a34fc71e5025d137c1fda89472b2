To boost the groundnut farming for exports, the Federal Economic Executive Council has selected and approved a seedling sample to be planted by farmers in the 36 states of the country. The Nigeria Export Promotion Council ( NEPC) revealed this at a press conference in Gusau, Zamfara State, assuring that it was committed to boosting agricultural productions as an alternative source of revenue to the national purse. The NEPC Adviser in Gusau, Yusuf Isma’il Idris at a one day workshop for groundnut farmers held in Maru local government of Zamfara, said the move is to ensure that Nigerian crops meet international standard. He said farmers will be educated on modern techniques of groundnut farming to make the crop serve as an alternative source to oil export. Idris said the federal government had earmarked one farm product per each state across 36 states of Nigeria to ensure uniformity in farm production and value chain development for export.
