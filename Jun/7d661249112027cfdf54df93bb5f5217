Bishop David Oyedepo of Living Faith Church has claimed that the gunmen who attacked and killed over 40 worshippers of St. Francis Catholic Church Owo in Ondo State have all been found. Recall that some bloodthirsty gunmen last Sunday, attacked the church during worship hour and opened fire on people, leading to the death of about 43 worshippers while others were seriously injured. Oyedepo had while reacting to the news, declared seven days ultimatum for the assailants to be arrested, saying if they escape, then he is not sent by God. Reports emerged on Thursday night via a trending video that the attackers have been arrested in the state. The Ondo State Police Command, however, denied the report, saying the information was only a rumour. But Oyedepo while speaking at a sermon at the church’s headquarters in Ota, Ogun State, thanked God that the criminal elements have all been found. He said, “Our God answers prayers, all those demons that attacked the Church in Owo have all been found. It is not seven days yet. In the same way, all the enemies of your soul shall be caught and judged and sent to eternal silence. “I said of they are not caught within seven days then I’m not called by God, now, they have all been caught. The end has come for all their sponsors also. They steal and then use the stolen money to torment the people”.
