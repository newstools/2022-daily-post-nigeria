The Adamawa State Police Command has arrested six suspects over a communal clash which occurred in Guyuk and Lamurde Local Government Areas of the state. The lingering Lunguda-Waja clashes reoccurred last week, claiming four lives and causing destruction to valuable assets. The state Police Command said in a statement Thursday that in its effort to bring an end to the clashes by restoring normalcy in the affected LGAs, its operatives apprehended six suspects in connection with the latest clash. The suspects include Honga Bulus, 20, and Abdulsalam Shaibu, 18, both residents of Boshikiri in Guyuk LGA, according to the statement signed by Police image maker Suleiman Nguroje. The statement named other suspects as Shitu Garba, 25; Abubakar Hamman, 48, Sale Umar, 26; and Ayuba Idi, 28, being residents of Lafiya in Lamurde LGA. The Police said the suspects who had been established to be active at the crime scenes, are currently assisting the police in identifying the sponsors and collaborators. He added that as part of a holistic approach, the state Commissioner of Police, Sikiru Akande, has embarked on a community policing and sensitization campaign to bring the conflicting parties together for a possible reconciliation.
