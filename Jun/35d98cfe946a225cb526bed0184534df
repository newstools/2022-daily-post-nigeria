Manchester United’s new boss, Erik ten Hag has been able to convince Frenkie de Jong to leave Barcelona for Manchester United. The deal is now subject to agreement between the two clubs. Both men worked together at Ajax before the midfielder joined Barcelona in 2019 and Erik ten Hag wants to make him his first signing as Manchester United manager. The midfielder, who helped Ajax win the Dutch title and reached the Champions League semi-final in 2019, has continued to impress at Barcelona. The Dutchman has made 140 appearances for Barca over the last three seasons, establishing himself as a key member of the first-team squad. The Daily Mirror reports that Ten Hag has persuaded De Jong to join the Red Devils and reports from Europe on Friday, claimed Barcelona had rejected United’s £60m bid for the midfielder and were holding out for a package worth around £80m. The newspaper says that De Jong decided to move to Manchester United following a series of talks with Ten Hag. The Mirror reports that De Jong has had a change of heart after Ten Hag told him about his plan to turn United into title contenders and also reminding him of the success they shared at Ajax. After signing De Jong, the Dutch manager will turn his attention to bringing in a new forward and defender.
