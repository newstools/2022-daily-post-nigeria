President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday said he lived daily in grief and worry. Buhari disclosed that he lived in daily grief and worry over victims of terrorists attacks in Nigeria.

He assured that his administration in collaboration with security men are working hard to tackle insecurity. According to Buhari: “We can only have a safe country if we are able to prevent crime not after the crime has been committed. “On this special day, I want us all to put all victims of terrorist activities in our thoughts and prayers. I am living daily with the grief and worry for all those victims and prisoners of terrorism and kidnapping. “I and the security agencies are doing all we can to free those unfortunate countrymen and countrywomen safely. “For those who have lost their lives, we will continue to seek justice for their families against the perpetrators. For those currently in captivity, we will not stop until they are freed, and their kidnappers are brought to justice. “If we all unite, we will be victorious against these agents of terror and destruction.”
