Chelsea defender, Thiago Silva, has welcomed Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar to join the Blues. Silva and Neymar are international teammates with the Brazil national team. Neymar is contracted with PSG till 2025, but the 30-year-old has been linked with a move away from the French Ligue 1 champions. It was recently reported that Chelsea and Juventus are interested in acquiring the services of Neymar. PSG are also willing to sell Neymar for a cut-price fee of €90 million. Speaking to JC (via Sport Witness), Silva said, “He [Neymar] has to go to Chelsea. If it happens, it will be for the best. “He needs no comments. So far, I don’t know anything, but I hope it comes to fruition.”
