Over 10,000 pastoralists were killed and over two million displaced across the country within the last seven years, the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), has said. It made the disclosure during a security summit the group organized in collaboration with the Northern Consensus Movement (NCM) in Abuja. The summit titled, “Exploring the contemporary challenges facing pastoralism and Fulbe, with a view to proffering workable solutions in curbing insecurity across the nation”, opined that from 2015 till date, many pastoralists were also displaced and impoverished, alleging that over four million livestock were either rustled or arbitrarily killed. In a communique issued on Friday, the MACBAN stated that Fulani pastoralists were the worst victims following the current security challenges in the country, ranging from banditry to kidnapping and cattle rustling. The communique explained that, “Stereotyping and stigmatisation of herders, and the incendiary role of social and the mainstream media, leading to profiling, are a prelude to genocide.” It further alleged that “barbaric activities” of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB)/the Eastern Security Network (ESN) and the ’Yan-Sa-Kai’ have worsened the security situation and threatened the corporate existence of the country. According to the communique, there are over four million out-of-school pastoral children roaming about. The summit called on government, as well as individuals and non-governmental organisations to support and prioritise the education of pastoralists and rural communities. The group, however, called for the overhaul of Nigeria’s criminal justice system to prosecute and punish criminals found guilty of crimes in every part of the country.
