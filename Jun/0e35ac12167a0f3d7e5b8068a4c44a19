They are ready to defend their votes so I don’t believe it going to be possible. It’s not by force to rule, people have to decide who they want and I believe it is me, Senator Ademola Nurudeen Adeleke. “The chances of PDP are growing, let me just say 80%, and I thank you so much for your cooperation.”
