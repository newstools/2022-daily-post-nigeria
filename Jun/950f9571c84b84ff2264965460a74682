Biodun Abayomi, a 20-year-old mother of one, has been arrested by men of the Ondo State police command for allegedly killing a 17-year-old boy, named Mohammed Jamiu, in the state. The incident was allegedly perpetrated on May 28, 2022, in Ebute, Okitipupa, headquarters of Okitipupa Local Government Area. Biodun, who was paraded at the police headquarters in the State on Tuesday, claimed that she was attacked by the deceased and three of his companions when she committed the crime. Jamiu and his friends, she claimed, approached her on a riverside in the community and descended on her before she stabbed the deceased in the neck. She revealed that the deceased was enraged because he thought she was the one who stopped her friend from dating him. “I had wanted to stab him on his hand but I mistakenly stabbed him on the neck. The other boys ran away and the boy and I stayed there. “The boy was rushed to the hospital by some people in the area and I was advised to run away but I refused to run away, that I did not kill someone. “It was later that policemen came to arrest me that I have killed someone. They beat me before they took me away. I insisted that I didn’t kill anybody. “It was when I got to station that I saw the mother of the boy crying that I had killed her son. But I begged her,” she said.
