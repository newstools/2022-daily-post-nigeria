Hours after the horrific attack at Saint Francis Catholic Church, Owo, headquarters of Ondo State, the town is still in a pensive mood with roads deserted. A visit to the town by DAILY POST revealed that most shops are still under lock and key with socio-economic activities partially shut down. Dare-devil gunmen had on Sunday rained terror in the community when they attacked the church located in the heart of the town. Entering the town from Emure junction down to the post office area and up to the Ijebu-Owo axis, residents were seen in clusters discussing the unfortunate incident. For some of the residents, the deadly attack on the church was an attack on humanity. Meanwhile, families of the injured victims of the incident are still thronging the Federal Medical Center to ascertain the level of recuperation of their loved ones.
