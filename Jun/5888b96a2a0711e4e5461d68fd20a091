Golden Eaglets head coach, Nduka Ugbade showered encomium on his players after their impressive performance in Monday’s 3-1 win against Togo at the WAFU B U-17 Championship. The Nigerian boys recorded their second win of the competition following the opening day victory against hosts Ghana. They are also through to the semi-final where they will face the second-placed team in Group B next week Monday. Kevwe Iyede opened scoring for the Golden Eaglets on 10 minutes. Captain Precious Williams added another in the 22nd minute, while the Togolese cut the deficit 15 minutes from time. Substitute Light Eke restored Nigeria’s two-goal lead in the 81st minute. “We are determined to get the AFCON ticket. It is not yet celebration time for the team until the semi-final is won,” Ugbade told reporters. “The boys know the task ahead. We will keep working as a team and correct necessary mistakes noticed in the match against Togo. “I want to salute the players’ determination and dexterity in both matches played so far,” he added. The two finalists in the competition will feature at the Africa U-17 Cup of Nations in Algeria next year.
