Former Governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, has recounted how he nominated Professor Yemi Osinbajo as President Muhammadu Buhari’s running mate in 2015. Tinubu, while speaking with members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital on Thursday, said Buhari had before the election approached him to be his running mate, because he had failed with every other person he picked as running mates in his earlier attempts. The presidential aspirant stressed that it was former Senate President Bukola Saraki that thwarted the plan by playing the Muslim-Muslim ticket gambit. He said that he single-handedly nominated Osinbajo to occupy the post originally given to him. “I gave Osinbajo my right to be Vice President. You’re hearing this from me for the first time. That’s the truth,” Tinubu said.
