Ajax star, Daley Blind, has insisted that teammate Jurrien Timber is ‘wise enough to make his own choices’ amid interest from Manchester United but hopes his club can hold onto the defender for another season. Manchester United’s new manager, Erik ten Hag, is hoping to make Timber, who he coached at Ajax, one of his first signings at Old Trafford this summer. Timber was a key figure under Ten Hag last season but has suggested he is unsure over a move to Manchester, insisting he will let his ‘gut feeling be the deciding factor. But Blind, who spent four years at Manchester United, would prefer Timber remain at Ajax for one more season and snub a move to the Red Devils. “He is wise enough to make his own choices,” Blind told a press conference following Netherlands’ 4-1 win over Belgium on Friday night. “I don’t need to explain what kind of talent and player he is. How important he is to us. “What he shows from the start, though, is unbelievable. Of course, as a teammate, I hope he stays for another year. I cannot influence that. “I can only say that Ajax must do its best to keep him.”
