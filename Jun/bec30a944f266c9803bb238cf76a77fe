Chelsea striker, Timo Werner is in agreement with the club as they are ready to tempt Juventus into selling defender, Matthijs de Ligt by offering him (Werner)as part of the deal. The Blues are now ready to kick-off and ramp up their transfer activity in the coming weeks. Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen have left the club already and the club are looking to strengthen the defence. The Blues have shown interest in Sevilla’s Jules Kounde and came within a whisker of signing him last summer. Now the 23-year-old Kounde has slipped down manager Thomas Tuchel’s wishlist with Barcelona now appearing to be the centre-half’s most likely destination. Tuchel’s side are now focusing their attention on signing De Ligt who is reported to have told the Italian giants he wants to leave this summer after three years in Turin. Sky Italy reports that Chelsea are willing to pay €45m and use German striker, Wener as part of the deal. Werner is largely seen as a disappointment at Chelsea since after joining from RB Leipzig and has struggled to nail down a regular starting place under both Tuchel and his predecessor Frank Lampard. And the Germany international is said to be keen on moving to Juventus and would accept a lower wage.
