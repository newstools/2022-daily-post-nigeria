Manchester United defender, Raphael Varane, has urged the club’s new manager, Erik ten Hag, to ensure the team trains hard and be ready for next season. Varane, 29, is looking forward to working under Ten Hag next season as Man United enter a new era under the former Ajax coach. Man United finished in sixth position on the Premier League table last season. “It’s a new season, it’s a new start, so everyone is excited to know about the new manager. Obviously, we want to do well and win every game, so, for this, we will have to prepare for the new season, and I think it’s important for us to train hard and be ready,” Varane told Man United’s official website. He added, “We need to work very hard and there will be a lot of training sessions and a lot of games, so I think it will be interesting and a great moment to work very hard and to prepare for the season.” Varane joined Man United from Real Madrid for £36 million last summer and encountered a difficult debut season at Old Trafford.
