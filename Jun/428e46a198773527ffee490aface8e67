The South East Revival Group (SERG) has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security agencies to protect Igbos registering to vote. A statement on Saturday by the National Coordinator, Willy Ezugwu also advised INEC to extend the deadline for the Continuous Voters Registration (CVR). The group reacted to reports that Igbos in Lagos and parts of the South-East were being allegedly marginalised in their attempt to register. SERG cited videos on social media showing scenes at the Alaba International in Ojo, and some other areas in Lagos. “We call on INEC and all security agencies in the country to protect Igbos who are seeking to register as voters. “The CVR exercise should be extended to enable all eligible voters to register to vote or collect their Permanent Voter Cards (PVC) in view of the current challenges.” Ezugwu said the insecurity in the South-East and military operations in some communities justify the calls for an extension of the CVR exercise. SERG further urged INEC to ensure that the PVC of all registered voters are printed and distributed before the 2023 elections. On Friday, the electoral umpire announced the deployment of 209 machines to Lagos, Kano and South-East states.
