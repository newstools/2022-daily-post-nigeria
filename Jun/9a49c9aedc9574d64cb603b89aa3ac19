Governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have congratulated Ifeanyi Okowa after he emerged as the party’s vice-presidential candidate for the 2023 polls. PDP presidential flag bearer, Atiku Abubakar, on Thursday picked the Delta State Governor as his running mate. In a statement signed by its chairman, Aminu Tambuwal, the PDP Governors Forum (PDP-GF) said the choice of Okowa is a sign of hope for Nigerians. “The Peoples Democratic Party Governors Forum (PDP-GF) hereby congratulates the Governor of Delta State, Senator Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, on his emergence as the Vice Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the 2023 General elections,” it read in part. It added that Atiku promised to pick a serving PDP Governor as his running mate “because of the contributions of the Governors to the effective running of the Party and its stability, but because of their experience and executive capacity. He kept his word.” Atiku emerged as the PDP’s presidential candidate on May 28 and began the search for a running mate together with the leadership of the party by setting up a committee by the party’s National Working Committee on June 9. The ad hoc committee, consisting of representatives of former governors, incumbent governors, the NwC, and the Board of Trustees members, was saddled with the responsibility of recommending candidates for the vice-presidential slot.
