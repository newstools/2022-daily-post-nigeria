Goodluck Jonathan, a former president of Nigeria, has reacted to the victory of former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, as the 2023 presidential flag bearer of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Jonathan, who congratulated Atiku, also commended Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Rabiu Kwankwaso, presidential candidate of the New Nigerian Peoples Party (NNPP), among other winners of the various primaries recently conducted across the country. In a series of tweets on his Twitter handle on Thursday evening, Jonathan urged all the presidential flagbearers of all political parties to prioritize peace and stability as they conduct their campaigns ahead of the 2023 general elections. He tweeted: “I congratulate the winners of the various primaries across the political spectrum, particularly Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP). “They include Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso, New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), Malik Ado-Ibrahim, Young Progressives Party (YPP), Chief Dan Nwanyanwu, Zenith Labour Party (ZLP), Dumebi Kachikwu, African Democratic Congress (ADC), as well as Adewole Adebayo of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). “Your emergence as the flagbearers of your parties after submitting yourselves to a rigorous selection and election processes demonstrates your belief and interest in the progress of our nation. “I urge you to conduct your campaigns in a manner devoid of acrimony, divisiveness and treachery so that at the end of the day, Nigeria will win, democracy will triumph and humanity will be better for it. “As I have always said, no ambition is worth the life of another. As candidates, you must eschew violence and acts that will encourage any form of bloodletting or exacerbate the national fault lines. “I urge all leaders, especially politicians, to prioritize the peace and stability of our nation as we commence the activities of 2023 elections.”
