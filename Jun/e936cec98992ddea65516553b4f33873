Former Kaduna Central Senator, Shehu Sani has admonished presidential candidates and their supporters to conduct their campaigns with decency, maturity, and a sense of responsibility. This, he said, is due to the fragile and inflammable state of the country. Shehu Sani on Thursday via his Twitter handle gave the advice as the race for the most exalted office of the land intensifies. He twitted saying, “In view of the fragile and inflammable state of this country, candidates and their supporters should conduct their campaigns with decency, maturity, and a sense of responsibility. “Whipping up ethnic, sectional & religious sentiments will only burn down the country they want to lead”. Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP); Bola Ahmed Tinubu of All Progressives Congress (APC); Peter Obi of Labour Party (LP); Prince Adewale Adebayo of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), among others are some of the strong presidential candidates jostling to occupy the nation’s number one seat in 2023.
