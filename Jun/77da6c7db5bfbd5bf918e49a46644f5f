The federal government has confirmed the invasion of swarm birds and locusts destroying farm produce in Sokoto, Kebbi and Zamfara States. This was disclosed in a statement on Sunday by the Chief Veterinary Officer of the Federation, Dr. Maimuna Habibu. According to her, Zamfara and Kebbi were the most affected states by locust invasion, saying that the ministry has already deployed officers to begin aerial attacks against the locusts in the affected states. She said farmers in the affected states have on several occasions complained of destruction of their farm produce by the locusts, hence the federal government took the necessary action.
