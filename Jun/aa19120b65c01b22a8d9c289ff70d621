Former Arsenal captain, Alexandre Lacazette, has undergone his medical today ahead of completing his free transfer to Lyon. Lacazette’s contract with the Gunners expires at the end of June. Both the Frenchman and the Premier League side have already confirmed his exit. The 31-year-old joined the Gunners from Lyon for £46m in the summer of 2017. During his time with Arsenal, he went on to score 71 goals in 206 games. However, the goals dried up a little for Lacazette this season – he scored six in 36 games – and he and Arsenal have now decided to go their separate ways.
