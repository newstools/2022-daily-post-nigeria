The Yobe State PoliceCommand Wednesday cautioned residents of the state to be wary of fraudulent text messages asking them to register their support for a presidential candidate for financial reward. The Command’s Spokesman, ASP Dungus Abdulkarim, gave the warning when he spoke with newsmen in Damaturu. He said criminals were using the Short Message Service (SMS) to defraud unsuspecting members of the public. The SMS reads: “Presidential Candidate Support: Beloved, vote Atiku Abubakar as your choice for change and N69,220 will be offered to you as a serious member. Call management on 07062506048.” According to the police spokesman, investigation revealed that the text message in question is fake, hence emanated from fraudsters. He warned that anyone that responds to it will be required to provide security details of their bank accounts to the fraudster who will break into the account and steal money in it. “Police are investigating a recent case in which a woman was defrauded of N1.7 million in similar circumstances after the fraudster(s) offered to auction some relief materials to her,” Abdulkarim said. He stressed that under no circumstance should ATM pins, BVN and other bank security codes be provided to dubious persons during business transactions, while also calling on Point of Sale (POS) operators to be cautious of fake transaction text messages. ASP Abdulkarim also noted that there are reports of people going to POS operators to request for cash and the latter would receive credit alerts through his or her bank account. “Many POS operators were defrauded through this means, even as the usual transaction messages were sent to them. “What needs to be understood is that bank transaction messages must come in the corporate name of the bank, and do not receive responses or replies. “When someone says he pays money into your account and the text message comes in an anonymous or individual’s name, it is simply a fake,” he said.
