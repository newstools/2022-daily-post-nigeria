Ahead of the 2023 elections, the Lagos State chapter of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo socio-cultural organization, has refuted reports that it dumped Labour Party, LP, presidential candidate, Peter Obi and endorsed Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress, APC. President of the chapter, Sunday Ossai, said the misleading claim that Ohanaeze in Lagos dumped Obi for Tinubu was from the pit of hell. Ossai blamed his predecessor, Solomon Aguene, for peddling such claims. He stressed that nobody other than himself was authorized to speak on behalf of the group. In a statement he issued, Ossai noted that the claim was meant to serve some private interest and not that of Ohanaeze in Lagos State. The statement read partly: “The attention of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide has been drawn to the news making the rounds with a caption ‘Ohanaeze Ndigbo dumps Peter Obi, declares support for Tinubu’. “The purveyor of the above remarks is Chief Solomon Aguene, the immediate past president of Ohanaeze, Lagos State Chapter. “Ohanaeze, therefore, informs the general public that the current president of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Lagos State Chapter is Chief Sunday Ossai and only the Chapter President or an authorized officer of the current Lagos state executive has the right to speak on behalf of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Lagos State Chapter. “For the avoidance of doubt, the misleading impression that ‘Ohanaeze dumps Obi’ is from the pit of hell and meant to serve private interest. Such a statement is hereby vehemently debunked.” A few days ago, Tinubu, Obi and Atiku Abubakar emerged as their parties’ presidential candidates.
