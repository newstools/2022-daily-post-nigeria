Former Manchester United defender, Rio Ferdinand has claimed Harry Maguire, Raphael Varane, Victor Lindelof and Eric Bailly could be pushing to leave Manchester United this summer. Erik ten Hag has already suffered a setback in trying to bolster his defence this summer, after Jurrien Timber has opted to remain at Ajax. United are still in the market for a new central defender and Ferdinand believes two centre-backs from the current squad could look to depart Old Trafford. “I’ll be interested to see what Ten Hag does in that area. “We’re talking about the young lad, Timber, at Ajax, a small centre-half. “I’ll be interested to see what happens with Varane, Lindelof and Maguire, Eric Bailly as well. I think one or two of those will go,” Ferdinand said on Vibe with Five.
