Former Kogi West Senator, Dino Melaye, has disclosed why he supported the presidential ambition of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, instead of ex-Senate President Bukola Saraki. Melaye explained that he opted for Atiku because he would win the 2023 presidential election with a landslide victory. Featuring on TVC’s current affairs programme, Journalists’ Hangout, Melaye said Atiku possesses the qualities to unite Nigeria. The former lawmaker insisted that he supported Saraki 100 per cent while he was with him. According to Melaye, he never switched from Saraki because they still see each other. He said: “I did not switch support from Saraki to Atiku. I was 100 per cent with Saraki when I was with him. I have no problem with Saraki, I still saw him this morning and we both laughed together. “I chose Atiku this time because I have to stay with the known to the unknown. At this time, we need a unifier, who can unite Nigeria. One who cannot be seen as a Muslim, or Christian. “Atiku is a popular person whose name is known in Nigeria. So, I moved from unknown to known. So, I did not switch support but support the man who can make Nigeria great.” Atiku clinched the PDP presidential ticket during the party’s convention in Abuja on Saturday. The Waziri of Adamawa defeated Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, Saraki and other Presidential aspirant’s to emerge as the party’s candidate. Atiku polled 371 votes ahead of Wike who had 237 votes, and Saraki with 70. Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Emmanuel, scored 38; Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, polled 20 votes; Anyim Pius Anyim scored 14, Sam Ohabunwa polled 1 and Olivia Tariela also scored one vote.
