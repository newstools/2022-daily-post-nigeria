Chelsea has become the latest club to join the race to sign Gabriel Jesus from Manchester City this summer. The Blues’ new owner, Todd Boehly, is keen to make the Brazil striker one of his first signings. City manager Pep Guardiola is willing to let Jesus leave The Etihad after signing Erling Haaland in a £51 million deal. Real Madrid was the latest team to join the hunt, after reportedly being offered the player but they face plenty of competition. Chelsea has shown “strong interest” in Jesus, according to Spanish outlet AS, and is preparing a bid once the legalities of Boehly’s deal have officially gone through. Jesus, who scored eight times in 21 starts for Man City in their title-winning season in the last campaign, has also been heavily linked with moves to Premier League sides Arsenal and Tottenham.
