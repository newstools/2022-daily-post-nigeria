Three local hunters allegedly involved in kidnapping activities in Adamawa State have been arrested. The state Command of the Nigeria Police, which made the arrest, said the three suspects had been conspiring with others to aide kidnapping across Girei and Fufore Local Government Areas of the state. In a statement obtained on Sunday, the state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Suleiman Nguroje, said the suspects: Auwal Mohammed, 28 years old, Isa Umaru, 40 years and Rabiu Mohammed, 19 years “have been terrorizing Girei, Daware and Pariya villages” of the indicated LGAs. He said the three, who are all members of the hunters association attached to Tambajam and Tsigire Villages of Fufore and Song LGAs as community vigilantees, are collaborators of the nefarious kidnapping activities going on in that axis. “Investigation so far reveals that the above suspects betrayed the trust reposed in them by community members as people protecting lives and properties, and went ahead supplying food items and other needs to their fellow kidnappers around that area,” he added. “The police recovered one locally made pistol, one TVS motorcycle, food items, mats, ropes and other items from the suspects,” Nguroje stated.
