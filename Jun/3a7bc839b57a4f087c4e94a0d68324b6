Another two Arsenal stars, Mika Biereth and Tyreece John-Jules have left the club. Biereth joined Dutch Eredivisie side RKC Waalwijk on loan, while John-Jules joined League One side Ipswich Town on loan for the 2022/2023 season. Arsenal confirmed this in separate statements via its website. The statement read in part, “Mika Biereth has joined Dutch Eredivisie side RKC Waalwijk on a season-long loan. “The 19-year-old striker joined us from Fulham in July last year. He scored 13 goals in 29 appearances for us at Under-23 level last season, including 10 goals in the PL2 campaign.” On John-Jules, Arsenal’s statement read, “Tyreece John-Jules has joined League One side Ipswich Town on loan for the 2022/23 season. “The 21-year-old forward gained further experience during two loan spells last season, spending the first half of the season at Blackpool, where he made 12 appearances, before moving to Sheffield Wednesday in January, where he featured 13 times.” Meanwhile, recall that Arsenal had earlier this week confirmed the departure of Harry Clarke and Omar Rekik.
