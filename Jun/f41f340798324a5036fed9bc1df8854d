The Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo has said although the All Progressives Congress (APC) has achieved victory in the just concluded governorship election in Ekiti State, the ruling party must be ready to do more in a bid to repeat the same feat in Osun State. In his reaction to the result of the polls, Keyamo congratulated Biodun Oyebanji, who is now the Governor-elect. “Whilst this buoys our spirits in APC and I congratulate our own Biodun Oyebanji on this momentous feat, we must keep our feet firmly on the ground as there’s greater work ahead to win the Osun Governorship election and the 2023 Presidential elections. “There should be no complacency,” Keyamo tweeted on Sunday. Oyebanji clinched 15 out of the 16 Local Government Areas in Ekiti state gathering 187,057 votes. The candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Segun Oni, polled 82,211 votes, while the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Bisi Kolawole gathered 67,457 votes.
