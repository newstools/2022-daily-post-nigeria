Argentina captain, Lionel Messi, has singled out Italy’s Jorginho for praise following his side’s Finalissima’s 3-0 victory on Wednesday. Messi said it was difficult for Argentina to control Jorginho during the first 20 minutes of the encounter, adding that the Chelsea star was playing alone in the midfield. Messi led Argentina to defeat Argentina, thanks to goals from Lautaro Martinez, Angel Di Maria and Paulo Dybala. The seven-time Ballon d’Or winner provided two assists in the game to win the Player of the Match award. Speaking to TyC Sports after the game, Messi said, “It was a close match until the first goal. They are a great national team and up until the first 20 minutes, it was difficult for us to control Jorginho, he was playing alone and we couldn’t get the hang of the pressure. But after the first goal, the game completely changed.”
