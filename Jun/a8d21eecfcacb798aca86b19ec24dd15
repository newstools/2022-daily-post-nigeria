Super Eagles head coach, Jose Peseiro, is in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital, to inspect the playing surface of the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium. Peseiro will also watch the Nigeria Professional Football League encounter between holders Akwa United and Plateau United. The Portuguese complained about the poor turf of the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja, prior to the Super Eagles 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against the Leone Stars of Sierra Leone a few weeks ago. The Super Eagles will face the Djurtus of Guinea-Bissau in their next game in the qualifiers in September and the fixture could be staged in Uyo. The three-time African champions adopted the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium as their home ground for many years. They have however hosted opponents at the Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba, Dela State; Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, Benin City, Edo State; and Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos, in recent times. They recently moved to the MKO Stadium, Abuja for their home games.
