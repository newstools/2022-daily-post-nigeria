Former Chelsea star, Scott Minto, has urged manager Thomas Tuchel to get rid Romelu Lukaku and bring in Robert Lewandowski from Bayern Munich. Minto claims the Belgian’s failure to adjust to Tuchel’s style means it is time to move on. Lukaku returned to Stamford Bridge last summer, but has endured a miserable campaign. Lewandowski meanwhile is looking to force a move out of Bayern Munich with Barcelona his preferred destination. Minto feels the Blues should go all-in for Lewandowski. “Tuchel has said it’s not about us adjusting to him (Lukaku), he has to adjust to us. It has clearly not happened. “Lewandowski would be absolutely superb in the short term. Even if he’s on a two-year contract, he might get away with a three. He’s proven right now. Chelsea are all about the here and now, they have been for the last two decades,” Minto told talkSPORT.
