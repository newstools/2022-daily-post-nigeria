Barcelona manager, Xavi Hernandez, has told his former team-mate Gerard Pique that he is no longer part of his plans and can leave the club. According to SPORT, Xavi informed the defender of his decision two weeks ago, because of his unprofessional conduct off the field and his deteriorating physical condition. It came before Pique’s split from Colombian singer Shakira. Xavi also has issues with the player’s numerous business interests off the field, and it is believed that Pique is owed about €40million (£34.3m) by Barca for deferred payments. Barca hope that Pique will make a dignified departure this summer and even let them off some of the £34.3m that they owe him, just like legendary figure Carles Puyol did when he left in 2014.
