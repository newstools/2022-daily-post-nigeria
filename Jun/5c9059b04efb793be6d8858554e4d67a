The Taraba State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has condemned the attack on worshippers of St. Francis Catholic Church in Ondo State. The CAN in a statement, made available to media practitioners in Jalingo on Monday, by its chairman, Rev. Isaiah Magaji Jirapye, said it’s quite unfortunate that Nigeria is going down the drain. The leadership of the association who could not fathom the rationale behind the attack argued that “it is barbaric on the innocent people who converge to worship and the killers decided to take arms against them.” Describing the attack as “barbaric, evil and ungodly in the eyes of citizens who believe in the unity and progress of the country” the need for the federal government to work round the clock to ensure the perpetrators are brought to book, he believed can no longer be overemphasized Commending the Ondo State Government for its swift visit to the scene of the incident, Taraba CAN urged Christians to be vigilant since the recent attacks are being targeted at them. He said, “It’s quite unfortunate that Nigeria is going down the drain, it is barbaric on the innocent people who converge to worship and the killers decided to take arms against them.” Sad that in Nigeria “we only hear of investigation till another incident come to override the ones being investigated, he beckoned at the government at the center “not just to investigate the Ondo attack but to bring the perpetrators to book.” More to his demands, he said “I want the federal government to rise against the brewing religious crisis in the country, Christians are peace-loving people but if they are frequently pushed, Nigeria would see a day that no one wishes.” Scores of persons, especially women and children, were said to have been attacked by yet-to-be-identified gunmen while observing the Sunday worship at the said Catholic church.
