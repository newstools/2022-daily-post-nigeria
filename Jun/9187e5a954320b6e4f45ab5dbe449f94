Manchester United are close to agreeing to a £70m deal with Barcelona for their midfielder, Frenkie de Jong, this summer. According to Spanish outlet, Sport, Manchester United have been discussing terms with Barcelona for several weeks and a deal is now close to being reached between both clubs for De Jong. The report added that Barcelona are taking the opportunity to cash in on the 25-year-old as they look to improve their dire financial situation, but Man United still face a fight to convince the Netherlands international to leave the Nou Camp. New Man United manager, Erik ten Hag, worked with De Jong during their time at Ajax, Ten Hag wants to bolster his squad with a new midfielder, striker and centre back this summer, with the likes of Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard and Edinson Cavani leaving the club following the 2021-2022 campaign. While De Jong is attracted to the English Premier League and enjoys playing under Ten Hag, the lack of UEFA Champions League football at Old Trafford is acting as a deterrent. De Jong has made 140 appearances for Barcelona since joining the Catalan club from Ajax in 2019.
