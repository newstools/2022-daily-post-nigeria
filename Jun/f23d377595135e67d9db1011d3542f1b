German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said that sanctions against Russia by western countries were hurting his country and other allies. He, however, maintained that Europe and its allies would have to pay the price since freedom, democracy, solidarity with friends and partners have their prices. He promised that Germany will continue to support Ukraine during a speech at the Annual meeting of the Federation of German Industries on Tuesday, as reported by CNN. “Unprecedentedly tough sanctions” were imposed on Russia. “These sanctions do work. Yes, these sanctions are hurting ourselves as well. They hurt our companies, but they are right,” Scholz said. “Freedom has its price. Democracy has its price. Solidarity with friends and partners has its price. And we are prepared to pay this price,” Scholz said. Scholz said his trip to Irpin near Kyiv last Thursday made clear to him that Ukraine belonged to the European family.
