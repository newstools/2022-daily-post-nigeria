AS Roma manager, Jose Mourinho, has emerged as a shock candidate to replace Mauricio Pochettino at Paris Saint-Germain next season. PSG are “seriously considering” replacing Pochettino as part of a major backroom shake-up. According to talkSPORT, the Ligue 1 champions have identified Mourinho as a prime candidate to become their next manager. Changes in the dugout are expected as part of a major revamp behind the scenes in line with Kylian Mbappe’s stunning new contract. Mbappe has snubbed Real Madrid to become the highest-paid player in football history on a three-year deal. As part of his agreement with PSG, the 23-year-old was handed incredible incentives, including the right to have a say in all football decisions the club makes. He was supposedly a driving force behind Leonardo’s exit as sporting director after endorsing incoming replacement Luis Campos. And Mbappe is understood to have also contributed to Nasser Al Khelaifi’s decision to sack Pochettino after another disappointing Champions League campaign.
