Former Arsenal star, Theo Walcott, has urged forward Bukayo Saka to stay at Emirates amid links to Premier League rivals, Manchester City and Liverpool. Walcott believes Saka’s playing time would be ‘limited’ next season if he moved to Manchester City or Liverpool this summer. On Tuesday, it was reported that Man City were stepping up their interest in Saka after Arsenal’s failure to secure Champions League football. Liverpool, on the other hand, have been linked with a move for the England international as manager Jurgen Klopp looks to improve his attacking options ahead of the likely departure of Sadio Mane and the potential exit of Mohamed Salah. But Walcott believes Saka should stay at the North London club and continue to be a key part of the ‘transitional’ period under manager Mikel Arteta. “Well, there is obviously a transitional stage at Arsenal that Mikel [Arteta] is part of, and [Bukayo] Saka is massively part of it as well,” Walcott told talkSPORT. “The younger crop of players at Arsenal coming through, I feel as though the club need to keep hold of him, simple as that. “Obviously, when Manchester City comes knocking on the door, it’s such a hard thing for any player to really turn down. “He is very young, but I feel that he likes the area of London in Arsenal, the fans have been fantastic, and at the Emirates, which is one of the best stadiums I’ve ever played in. “He has great support, and I will be intrigued. My heart says he’ll be at Arsenal next season, and we will see after that.”
