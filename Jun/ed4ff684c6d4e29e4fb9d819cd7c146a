Bashir Sheriff Machina, All Progressives Congress, APC, senatorial candidate for Yobe North, has kicked against the removal of his name on the list submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Machina, who was announced the winner of the primary conducted in Yobe North, urged the APC National Working Committee under the leadership of Senator Abdullahi Adamu to put his name as the candidate of the Yobe North Senatorial district or else he would take legal action. On the list that the APC submitted to INEC, the name of Senate President, Ahmad Lawan was registered as the candidate for the Yobe North Senatorial district in the 2023 elections. However, addressing a press conference on Friday, Machina said he remained the candidate of the ruling party in the senatorial district. According to Machina, “I remain the candidate of the APC Yobe North senatorial zone as duly elected. I didn’t withdraw for anybody and I will not withdraw because, as a matter of fact, it’s a mandate given to me by members of our great party, the delegates. So surreptitiously removing my name, I consider (it) as very undemocratic, illegal and, of course, inhuman. “I will take measures by first appealing to my party that if this action was truly done, it should be corrected, possibly if it was erroneously done. And it was deliberately done, we’re actually seeking redress from the National Working Committee of our party under the leadership of Senator Abdullahi Adamu. I remain the candidate. “I remain the candidate and it remains so. I hope our leadership will take the necessary measures. We’ll work hard to exploit and explore all the necessary channels as provided by our guidelines. In the event of the contrary, as Nigerian citizens and as law abiding citizens, the constitution of our country being the overall law above every aspect of our lives as Nigerians, I would’ve no choice but to resort to court (legal) action.”
