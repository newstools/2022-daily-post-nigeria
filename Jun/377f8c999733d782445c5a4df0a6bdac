The All Progressives Congress (APC) has refuted speculations of zoning the party’s 2023 presidential ticket. Some reports claim that President Muhammadu Buhari directed the selection of a standard-bearer of Southern origin. The Nigeria leader and party leaders met with the aspirants at the State House in Abuja, Saturday night. Muhammad Nata’ala Keffi, spokesman to National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu said the gathering didn’t discuss zoning. In a statement on Sunday, Keffi noted that such claims were false, mischievous and misleading. He said the President only advised the aspirants to build “a consensus that would help the party reduce the number of aspirants and bring up a formidable candidate”. “From the quotations from Mr President’s speech, nowhere was zoning mentioned. “We call on the public to disregard any information about the zoning of the presidential contest to any part country. “What Mr President want is the interest of Nigeria and Nigerians; no more, no less.” The statement added that APC was desirous of a credible and acceptable candidate who can move Nigeria forward with sincerity of purpose.
