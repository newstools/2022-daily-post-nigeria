Liverpool legend, Dirk Kuyt, has been appointed as the new head coach of ADO Den Haag in the Eerste Divisie. It is the first senior coaching role for Kuyt after he ended his playing career with his boyhood club Quick Boys back in 2018. Kuyt’s only previous coaching experience came with Feyenoord U19s. He had an illustrious career as a forward with successful spells in England, Turkey and the Netherlands. The 41-year-old scored 121 goals in 199 games for Feyenoord and made close to 300 appearances for Liverpool. Reacting, Kuyt said on Twitter on Thursday: “I am very proud to announce that I will be the next coach of ADO Den Haag. Looking forward to start.”
