Some labour leaders in Ogun State Tuesday, inflicted injuries on journalists for covering the ongoing industrial action in the state. The journalists were attacked at the entrance of the State Hospital, Ijaye, Abeokuta, where they had gone to monitor the workers’ level of compliance with the strike action directed by the organised labour in Ogun. Armed with canes and sticks, the union leaders beat the journalists and prevented them from performing their duties. Efforts by the reporters to stop the unprovoked attack were rebuffed even when the newsmen tendered their identity cards. Some of the female journalists involved in the incident also had their phones seized by the workers. Those attacked include Daud Olatunji of Punch Newspaper, Joke Adeleye of PM News, Michael Olaoluwa and Tutu Sobowale of Platform Times and Busola from an Abeokuta-based radio station. Narrating their ordeal, the newsmen said they could not understand why the labour leaders chose to assault them instead of seeing them as partners.
