Union Berlin managing director, Olivier Ruhnert was disappointed to see Taiwo Awoniyi leave the club. Awoniyi completed his transfer to Premier League new boys, Nottingham Forest on Saturday. Union Berlin made significant profit on the player they bought for £7m from Liverpool last summer. The Nigerian international moved to The City Ground for a record £17.5m fee. “It was clear that a player like Taiwo will attract the attention of other clubs with his performances,”Ruhnert told the club’s official website. “From a sporting and personal point of view, he is a great loss for our team, which must now be absorbed. “We wish Taiwo all the best for the future and thank him for his achievements in the shirt of 1. FC Union Berlin,” he said.
