Manchester United have made an offer to sign Christian Eriksen on a free transfer, The Athletic reports. Eriksen will become a free agent when his contract at Brentford expires on June 30 and new United boss Erik ten Hag is said to be interested in his services. Ten Hag views Eriksen’s former Ajax team-mate, Frenkie de Jong, as his primary target, but would be happy to sign the 30-year-old as an alternative option. Eriksen suffered a cardiac arrest during Euro 2020, but kickstarted his remarkable return to football with Brentford in January. In the just-concluded season, he scored a goal and registered four assists in 11 appearances to help keep the club in the top flight. United were keeping tabs on Eriksen’s progress and were reportedly happy with what they had seen.
