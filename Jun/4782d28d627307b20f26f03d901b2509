The Governor of Delta State, Ifeanyi Okowa, on Thursday appreciated the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, for picking him as his running mate. Okowa promised to work with Atiku to ensure PDP emerge victorious in the 2023 presidential election with a landslide. He spoke at the party’s headquarters while accepting Atiku’s offer as his running mate. Okowa urged members of the party to rally around Atiku to ensure PDP wins the 2023 presidential election. According to Okowa: “I appreciate the party for having a successful convention. The convention produced a very experience candidate who could rescue Nigeria from the terrible situation. I know it was a tough decision to pick me, like you said this afternoon. “I understand there is great work ahead of us, and I know God designed this, and we will work hard for the party’s victory. “Each and every one of us must support our principal to ensure the party wins in a landslide victory, and in doing so, we must be committed in our various wards. We need PDP to return to power; we have the answers to the questions of the country. “By the grace of God, we will take on the president and win in a landslide, and I wholeheartedly accept the offer.”
