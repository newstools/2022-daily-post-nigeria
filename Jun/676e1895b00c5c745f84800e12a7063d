Bishop David Oyedepo of the Living Faith Church has expressed optimism that the attackers of St. Francis Church, Owo in Ondo State would be punished for their actions. Some men armed with sophisticated weapons had on Sunday invaded the church during worship, killing over 40 worshippers while scores were injured. Following the attack, Oyedepo who spoke during a sermon at the church’s headquarters, Ota In Ogun State, expressed anger at the level of insecurity ravaging the entire nation. He declared instant judgement on the killers, saying they will perish with their sponsors. He said, “The devil is very scared of the church because that is where God empowers his people to rule in the midsts of the enemies. That is why those vagabonds were out there in Ondo State to kill. “I can tell you this, if they escape death, God has not sent me. Their generation will smell, and the people who sent them will smell. They shall be forgotten. The back of their camel is already broken. “Everybody living is created by God. All the gang-up from hell against the well being of this nation has come under a curse. Curse be to all those causing attack in this country”.
