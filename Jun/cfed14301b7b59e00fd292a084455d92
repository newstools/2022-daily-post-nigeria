Chelsea legend, Frank Leboeuf, has urged the club to move in for Leicester defender Wesley Fofana should the Blues not be able to strike an agreement for Sevilla’s Jules Kounde this summer. Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel is keen to sign a new defender to bolster his squad ahead of next season. Kounde has been a long-standing target in the transfer market for Chelsea who are in dire need of defensive reinforcements before the start of the new season as Antonio Rudiger has already left Stamford Bridge for Real Madrid. Speaking on ESPN FC Extra Time, Leboeuf backed Chelsea to go after Fofana who he described as an absolutely fantastic player. “I think Kounde is a very good option. If not, Fofana. Fofana from Leicester is an absolutely fantastic defender. “That would be a fantastic option as well [for Chelsea]. I am not sure Leicester would let him go, but he’s a great player.”
