Russia has taken over about 55 percent of the region of Donetsk with only 45 pe4cent still under the control of Ukrainian forces. “It is very difficult to say the rest [of the cities/territories in Donetsk] are controlled by the enemy, because these cities are being destroyed by the enemy — they are just territories,” Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Thursday, according to CNN. Kyrylenko is the head of the Donetsk region military administration. Kyrylenko also spoke about a concentration of battalion tactical groups in Sloviansk and Lyman. Ukrainian forces have “serious battles ahead,” he said. According to him, a continuation of shelling along the Bakhmut-Lysychansk highway is underway by the Russian forces to “cut off” Severodonetsk and Lysychansk from supplies.
