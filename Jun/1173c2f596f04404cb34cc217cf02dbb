The Executive Governor of Jigawa State, Alhaji Mohammed Badaru Abubakar has appealed to the aggrieved party members to forget all their grievances and work towards the victory of the party. The Governor made the call during a meeting with all the APC candidates along with the reconciliation committee led by Alhaji Bello Maitama at the State Government House in Dutse, the State capital of Jigawa. According to the Governor, “All hands must be on deck for the party’s victory in the coming 2023 general elections.” He appealed to all aggrieved party members, especially those who lost in the party’s primary elections, to accept it with good faith and continue working for the party. According to him, “Allah Subhanahu Wata’ala is solely responsible for giving leadership to his servants when He wants. Mohammed Badaru cannot make you a leader and cannot deny you the opportunity to be a leader. That is Allah’s duty. “For those that are aggrieved, I am appealing to them to sheath their swords and to forgive and forget, so that we can forge ahead and win elections come 2023.” “Everyone is important to us and we want everyone to support the party, we shall not let you down by the grace of God,” the Governor added. This is coming when some of the aggrieved party members who lost primary election are linked to a plan to decamp to the opposition New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP. DAILY POST reported that the Governor had inaugurated a reconciliation committee over the outcome of the just concluded primary elections.
