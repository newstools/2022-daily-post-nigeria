Olympiacos attacking midfielder, Mathieu Valbuena, has named Real Madrid and France striker, Karim Benzema, as the player that deserves to win the 2022 Ballon d’Or. Valbuena believes it would not be fair if Benzema doesn’t win the Ballon d’Or after guiding Real Madrid to win the Champions League. When asked about his thoughts on Benzema’s chances for the award, Valbuena was quoted by Sportskeeda as saying: “It wouldn’t be fair to say he doesn’t deserve the Ballon d’Or. Yes, he deserves the Ballon d’Or. “I can speak objectively on a sporting level. I am doing well my way too, there is no problem.” Valbuena and Benzema were former teammates in the French national team before a highly publicized blackmailing scandal in 2015. Benzema reportedly blackmailed Valbuena, 37, with a sex tape involving the former Olympique Marseille star. The case was taken to trial and a court found Benzema guilty and fined him for his illegal actions. The incident led to his exclusion from the international scene for more than five years before his return in 2021.
