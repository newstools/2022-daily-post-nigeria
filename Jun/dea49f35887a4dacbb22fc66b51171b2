The Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu campaign organisation has cleared the air on some of the statements attributed to the All Progressives Congress, APC’s national leader during the week. The campaign team in a statement signed by Bayo Onanuga, its Director
Media & Communications, described some of the reports carried about the APC leader as erroneous, misleading and mischievous interpretation. Tinubu, who is one of the leading aspirants of the ruling party, addressed party’s delegates in Abeokuta, capital of Ogun State on Thursday. Tinubu, who went down memory lane, boasted on how he brought his political clout and strategic skills to bring President Muhammadu Buhari and Abiodun to power in 2015. This, has, however, stirred mixed reactions among Nigerians with many saying Tinubu disrespected President Buhari. The group insisted that all what Tinubu said are factual and verifiable. The campaign organisation said it believes that the main thrust of Tinubu’s presentation, was that his huge contributions to the formation and electoral success of the APC should count in his favour as a true party man who desires to be the flag bearer. The campaign said also that the fresh conditions proposed by Buhari for the consideration of a presidential candidate of the party made it necessary for Tinubu to labour to convince the delegates that he fits the bill. “At no time did Tinubu play any ethnic card or denigrate any ethnic group,” the group said. “…Tinubu’s comment did not demonstrate any disrespect to President Buhari, for whom he has a very high regard, and whose re-election campaign he chaired in 2019 ” the group said.
