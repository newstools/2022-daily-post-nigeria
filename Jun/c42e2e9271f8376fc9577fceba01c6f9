Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State has debunked reports that he stepped down from the presidential race and endorsed Senate President, Ahmad Lawan. Report on Saturday emerged that Umahi had stepped down for Lawan after Lawan visited him on Saturday. But Umahi’s media aide, Francis Nwaze, described the report as inaccurate. He said Lawan had earlier visited Umahi as part of the last-minute effort to forge a partnership ahead of the primary. He said there was no discussion on the issue of stepping down during the meeting. “For the sake of discerning minds, what happened was that Senate President, Ahmed Lawal in a last-ditch effort to ramp up partnership ahead of the APC Presidential Primary, visited Governor Umahi in his Abuja residence on Saturday where they both promised to support whoever amongst the two and other Aspirants that emerge the Flagbearer of the Party in the Primary,” the statement reads. Nwaze explained that there was no time during the visit that the issue of stepping down by either Engineer Umahi or the Senate President was discussed or even suggested. He urged Nigerians to disregard the news item and assured that Umahi is still in the race to develop Nigeria.
