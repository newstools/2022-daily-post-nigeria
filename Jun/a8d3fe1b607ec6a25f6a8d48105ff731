The Coalition of South East Youth Leaders, COSEYL, has condemned call for immediate resignation of the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, over the just concluded presidential primary election. DAILY POST reports that some party stakeholders particularly from the Southern part of the country have continued to demand the resignation of the Ayu, for ignoring zoning and allowing Northerner to clinch the party’s ticket. But a statement issued on Wednesday by its President General, Goodluck Ubem, COSEYL asked those making the demand to shelve their ‘sword’, saying Ayu’s resignation may throw the party out of balance. COSEYL insisted that it would be wrong for anyone to expect PDP to be talking “about how to elect a new National Chairman of their party when other parties are working hard to win the elections next year. “This is not the right time to ask the National Chairman to resign just because a Northern presidential candidate emerged at the primaries of the party. “Asking Senator Ayu to resign now over the 2022 party’s presidential primaries will mean to count one’s chicks before they are hatched. “Political rancour and bickering is the last thing we need now in our political space. What we need now is what can put the nation on the path of development, love, understanding and healthy relationships. “We call on all stakeholders asking for the immediate resignation of the National PDP Chairman, Senator Iyorchia Ayu to allow him concentrate on his duties until after the general election upon which the outcome of the election will determine the next move of the party.”
