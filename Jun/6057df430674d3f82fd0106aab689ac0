Wayne Rooney has quit as manager of Derby County, claiming “the club needs fresh energy”. Derby remain in administration after a prolonged period of uncertainty, which saw the team relegated to Sky Bet League One. Rooney, however, received plenty of acclaim for the work done with the club in their battle to avoid the drop. After Derby enter administration, they were imposed with a 12-point deduction, which was followed by another nine-point penalty for breaching EFL accounting rules. If not for these punishments, the Rams would have finished 18th, level with Bristol City on 55 points. “Today I met with the administrators to inform them of my decision that it was time for me to leave the club. In fairness to them, they tried tremendously hard to change my decision but my mind was made up. “My time at the club has been a rollercoaster of emotions, both highs and lows, but I have to say that I have enjoyed the challenge,” Rooney said.
