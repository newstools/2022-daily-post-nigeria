French president, Emmanuel Macron, has urged former Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane to return to France to take charge of a Ligue 1 club. Macron’s remarks came amidst rumours of Paris Saint-Germain’s potential interest in appointing Zidane to succeed Mauricio Pochettino this summer despite the latter’s contract running until 2023. Zidane has been the man many have expected to succeed Pochettino, but he seems keen to become the next manager of the French national team. “No, I haven’t spoken [to Zidane], but I have great admiration for him as a player and coach,” Macron told RMC Sport on Wednesday. “He won three Champions League titles with Real Madrid, which is something we want for our clubs. I want him to come back to promote France. “I hope, for the impact on the French league and for France, that [Zidane] comes back and coaches a big French club, it would be great. “My role is to say that France is a great nation for sport and football, that there are great people who love this sport. It is important for us that the best players we have trained, who have sometimes shone at international level, can come back.”
