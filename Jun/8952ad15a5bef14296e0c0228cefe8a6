Candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and former governor, Chief Segun Oni has rejected the results of Saturday’s governorship election, saying the outcome would be challenged in the court. Oni, who spoke through his state collation agent and former attorney-general of the state, Owoseni Ajayi, noted that the results as declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) did not reflect the true decision of the people, lamenting that the process was marred by financial inducement. Ajayi, who refused to sign the election results, said, “we are rejecting the results because the election was characterised by violence and intimidation of voters and as a result, we will definitely challenge the outcome of these results in the court of law for prosterity and for generation coming to know that when conducting elections, you must follow the rules and procedures.” The All Progressives Congress’ Biodun Oyebanji was declared the winner of the election.
