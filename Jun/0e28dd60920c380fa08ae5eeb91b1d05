Former Kogi West Senator, Dino Melaye has dismissed claims that Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State betrayed his Rivers counterpart, Nyesom Wike during the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, primary election. Tambuwal had withdrawn from the presidential race and supported former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar. Tambuwal’s action is widely believed to have led to Atiku clinching the party’s presidential ticket. The Waziri of Adamawa polled 371 votes to defeat Wike who had 237 votes, and Saraki with 70. But, Wike had accused Tambuwal, delegates, and governors of betraying him during the convention. Reacting, Melaye stressed that Tambuwal did not betray Wike because there was no written agreement between the two of them. Featuring on TVC’s Journalists Hangout, Melaye said Tambuwal saw Atiku as the person PDP needs to win the next election. He said: “Governor Tambuwal saw the necessity to elect a candidate that can unite Nigeria, because our dear nation needs a father figure who can unite everyone, someone who will be able to unite Nigeria and that person is Atiku Abubakar. “Alhaji Atiku is sound and healthy, politically sagacious and intellectually sound. Atiku will not fail, he will win by a landslide. “Whatever APC is going to do in terms of manipulation, Atiku is the next president of Nigeria. Our convention has shown that we are more united than ever. We are one big family.”
