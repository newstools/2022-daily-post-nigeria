A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, on Wednesday, ordered the interim forfeiture of every asset of NOK University, located in Kaduna State. The University, built by a former Director of Finance and Accounts, DFA, in the Federal Ministry of Health, Anthony Hassan, was suspected to have been built from the proceeds of unlawful activities traced to its owner. Hassan, who was in the ministry between 2016 and 2019, was alleged to have built the university and acquired other properties through fraudulent means. Physical assets of the University forfeited include ICT building, Senate building, Faculty of Medicine building, two Academic buildings, Science Deanery building, a Faculty Hall and other buildings. Gwasmyen Water Factory, Gwasmyen International Hotel in Kaduna and Gwasmyen Event Center were all forfeited. Presiding judge, Justice Zainab Abubakar, gave order for the interim forfeiture while ruling on a motion ex-parte brought to the court by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC. Earlier, counsel to the EFCC, Ekele Iheanacho told the court that the commission sought the order in accordance with Section 44(2) of the 199 Constitution as amended. In the ruling, Justice Zainab directed that the interim forfeiture order be published in the National dailies to alert anyone with interest in the properties to show cause, within 14 days, to explain why the properties should not be forfeited to the Federal Government. Justice Abubakar, however, adjourned till October 5, 2022, for mention of the matter.
