Ismail Lawal has been elected unopposed as the candidate of the African Democratic Congress, ADC, for the seat of the Ekiti State House of Assembly, Ado, Constituency 2. He was elected through a unanimous decision of delegates during the primary election of the party held in Ado Ekiti under the tight watch of officials from Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, quarters and law enforcement agents. The chairman, electoral officer of the party, Mr. Fatai Akinola declared the voting process as fair and transparent. The winner, Ismail Lawal, however, appreciated the residents of his constituency and vowed to discharge duties accordingly, if elected. He thereby enjoined members of the party to march forth in their massive support for the party’s governorship candidate, Dr. Wole Oluyede and other contestants on the platform of ADC. “I appreciate everyone for your prayers and support to make sure that I emerge as the winner of this primary. “On this note, I promise to represent you well if we continue with this love and vote for me to attain this seat that I am vying for. “However, my victory is not yet fulfilled if we do not support our own. So, let’s all come out and support Dr Wole Oluyede and make sure he wins this gubernatorial election come June 18. God bless you all,” Lawal said.
