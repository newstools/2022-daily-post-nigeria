Aloy Ejimakor, the Special counsel to Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Monday made an appeal to the Federal Government. Ejimakor called on the Federal Government to stop the alleged persecution of Kanu. To mark one year of Kanu’s extraordinary rendition from Kenya, Ejimakor called on the Federal Government to free Kanu. In a tweet, the Special Counsel said Kanu’s extraordinary rendition was legally and politically wrong. In June 2021, Kanu was picked up in Kenya and repatriated to Nigeria. Upon his repatriation to Nigeria, the IPOB leader has been held by the Department of State Services, DSS, while his trial continues. However, Ejimakor tweeted: “It came to pass that one year ago, (June 19,2021) an extraordinary rendition was committed. It was a day that will live in infamy because it was an extraordinary abomination. “It was a legal wrong. It was a political wrong. And it must be undone. Stop the persecution and free Nnamdi Kanu.”
