The Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, has explained why he stepped down at the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential primary to support former vice-president, Atiku Abubakar. Tambuwal withdrew from the race and asked his supporters to vote for Atiku. He has now claimed it was a sacrifice for Nigerians and Nigeria as a country. The governor stated this while addressing a crowd who welcomed him back at the state government house on Friday shortly after his arrival from Abuja. Tambuwal said, “Thank you very much to our leaders and distinguished supporters from all over the country for your support and cooperation. I must thank the leaders of our party here at Sokoto State level and every level. “What we have done is for the good of our party and the country. I appreciate everyone of you that prayed for me and our party. The sacrifice that I have made on your behalf is aimed at strengthening our party, our democracy, and, by the grace of God, soft landing our polity. “This is in consonance with the teachings of our leaders and the [emulation] of the examples they have given to us in the past: that we must continue to make sacrifice for the good of all of us and our country. “I thank the people of Sokoto State and all my supporters across the country for their support. Rest assured, we shall work assiduously for the victory of our party come 2023 general election.”
