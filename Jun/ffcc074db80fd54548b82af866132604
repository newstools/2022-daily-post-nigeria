A young man, simply identified as Chigozie, on Friday committed suicide in Rumuolumeni Community in Obio-Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State. Chigozie was in his early 30s. He was said to have used a knife and a shovel to cut open his stomach to remove his intestines. The landlord of the house where the deceased lived said Chigozie had locked himself inside his room to carry out the act. He said the neighbours rushed to intervene when the victim’s wife raised alarm but were threatened by the victim with the sharp objects. He said he ran out of the room and headed towards the river side to drown himself before he was finally intercepted by some neighbours who rushed him to a hospital. He, however, gave up the ghost on the way to the hospital. According to the landlord, “I saw him bleeding when he ran out of the room and was heading to the River. “He was ready to hit anybody that attempted to come close. The neighbours tried their best but he still died.” The corpse has been deposited at the mortuary by his relatives.
