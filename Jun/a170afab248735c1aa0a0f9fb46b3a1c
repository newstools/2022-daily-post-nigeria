Former Sao Paulo midfielder, Richarlyson, has revealed that he has been involved romantically with both men and women. He becomes the first footballer from a Brazilian top-flight team to admit he is bisexual. Richarlyson played twice for Brazil in 2008 and was part of the Sao Paulo squad that beat Liverpool to win the Club World Cup in 2005. The 39-year-old won three national titles for the club. Ricky, as fans fondly called him, was also in Atletico Mineiro squad that won the 2013 Copa Libertadores. “All my life I was asked whether I was gay or not. I had relationships with men and I had relationships with women, too. “I am normal, I have wishes and desires. I dated men, I date women. So what? “So many people say it is important that I stand up, so I decided to say it today. I am bisexual,” Richarlyson said in the podcast aired by Globo Esporte. He explained that he didn’t talk about his sexuality previously because he believed “the world is not ready to have this discussion and handle this naturally.”
