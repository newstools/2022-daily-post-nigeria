Nnamdi Kanu’s lawyer, Aloy Ejimakor, has backed the call by the Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom for the immediate release of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB’s leader. Governor Ortom had during an interview with Arise TV on Wednesday, demanded the release of the secessionist who has been in the custody of the Department of State Services since 2021. Ortom, who was angered by the inability of the Federal Government to tackle the security menace in the country, said there was no need keeping the freedom fighter. He said, “I am calling for the release of Nnamdi Kanu. Why are you incarcerating a freedom fighter, and leave the Fulani men? Look at the Kaduna-Abuja train attack, up till today, our people are still being kept by these bandits. “Where is the security and the president? Tell me what is happening, it is a shame.” Reacting, Kanu’s counsel, Ejimakor said in a tweet that all Nigerians particularly the Southeastern leaders should emulate the governor. He wrote, “This is what everybody, particularly Southeast Governors/Leaders should be saying. #MNK”.
