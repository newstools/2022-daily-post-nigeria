A militants group, Black Marine, parading as the armed wing of Biafra Nations League, BNL, is believed to have kidnapped a female oil worker thought to be a French citizen. The abduction took place Thursday morning when a speed boat conveying her and other seafarers to work, was intercepted in the Idabato subdivision of Bakassi Peninsula, an area ceded to Cameroon. The female worker whose name was not immediately given is said to be working for Perenco Oil and Gas Company, which operates in the Rio Del Rey in the Gulf of Guinea. Sources said the victim’s speed boat was heading towards Ndian in southwest Cameroon. Commissioner of Police, Alhassan Aminu when reached for confirmation said, “I’m yet in Abuja. Let me contact my officers first.”
