Real Madrid president, Florentino Perez, has admitted that Lionel Messi’s move from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain created a big vacuum at LaLiga. According to Perez, no one has been able to fill this vacuum in this past year. Messi left Spain to sign for the Ligue 1 giants as a free agent in August. Florentino said on El Chiringuito: “The departure of Lionel Messi from FC Barcelona? “The other day, Marcelo also said a tearful goodbye. They are human. But I’m not happy when someone leaves a team and another arrives. “Everything that makes the Spanish league, Real Madrid and Barça happy, also makes everyone happy.”
