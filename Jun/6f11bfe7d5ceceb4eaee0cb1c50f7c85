Manchester United midfielder, Bruno Fernandes, could now finally wear his favourite number at the club next season. Fernandes has worn the no.18 shirt since joining from Sporting in January 2020. He became United’s talisman in that number and despite an underwhelming second full campaign, he still netted 10 Premier League goals. The Portuguese international is set for a prominent role in new boss Erik ten Hag’s plans, particularly after the exit of three of United’s most creative stars. The Red Devils have already confirmed the departure of academy graduates Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard ahead of the new campaign. Juan Mata, who wore the number 8 shirt, has become the latest high-profile star to confirm his exit The UK Mirror reports that Mata’s no.8 shirt becoming vacant is set to prove a silver lining for Fernandes. Mata has been United’s no.8 since arriving in 2014. The Spaniard’s exit gives 27-year-old Fernandes the chance to claim his perfect shirt number. Fernandes played in the jersey for old clubs Udinese and Sporting and even has the number tattooed on his forearm, showcasing its importance to him.
