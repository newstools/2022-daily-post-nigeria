The United Kingdom has expressed fears that Ukraine will be coerced to make a ‘bad peace’ with Russia. The UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, said Ukraine could face pressure to agree to a peace deal with Russia over the global food crisis. According to him, Volodymyr Zelensky’s side will enter a peace deal that will not be in the interests of his country as a result of the economic consequences of the ongoing war in Europe. The British Prime Minister is in Kigali, the Rwandan capital, with leaders of Commonwealth nations for a summit He told reporters, according to BBC, that “Too many countries are saying this is a European war that is unnecessary … and so the pressure will grow to encourage, coerce, maybe, the Ukrainians to a bad peace.” The UK Prime Minister then warned that there would be consequences if Russian President Vladimir Putin has his way in Ukraine. Johnson noted that this would be dangerous to international security and “a long-term economic disaster”.
