The Switch campaign launched by GUTS foundation to sensitize Nigerians on their voting power and the need to obtain their PVC, Saturday made another remarkable outing. The team comprises mainly young Nigerians yearning for a country that truly understands the power of the electorate, visited the Sauka community in the Federal Capital Territory, FCT. Sauka is a densely populated community located along the airport road.  At the community, the team met with voters who had either deliberately refused to register or had been procrastinating. No fewer than 200 of the 300 community members who came out for the exercise were pre-registered on the INEC portal, while community members were sensitized on the power they have to decide the future of the country by exercising their voting rights. Food and other items were distributed to community members who waited patiently for volunteers to get them registered.  One of the main attractions of the event was various competitions put in place for the community youths and children with prizes attached. Those who spoke to newsmen said the sensitization by Guts foundation will go a long way in influencing their decisions ahead of the 2023 elections.  On behalf of the team, the coordinator…thanked the community for their commitment towards the success of the event. Meanwhile, GUTS foundation is expected to take its campaign down to many other communities in Abuja.
