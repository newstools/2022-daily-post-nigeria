The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar has said he was in search of a credible vice presidential candidate who has the potential of succeeding him. Unveiling the Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa as his running mate on Thursday at the party’s headquarters, Atiku said Okowa has the potential he sought for. Atiku also said his running mate must understand the security challenges of the country, stressing that he (running mate) must have the ability to speak his mind on issues bothering the nation. The PDP presidential candidate stated that Okowa possesses all qualities needed for the job of a Vice president. According to him, Okowa has done well in education and other sectors as governor of Delta State. Reports had earlier emerged that Atiku would be picking the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike as his running mate. But according to some analysts, Wike may be too big for the office of Vice president and may not be loyal to Atiku as expected.
