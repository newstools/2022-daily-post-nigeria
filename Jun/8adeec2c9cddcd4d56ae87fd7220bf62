Paris Saint-Germain have snubbed the chance to hire former Real Madrid boss, Zinedine Zidane, as their new manager. The president of the Ligue 1 club, Al-Khelaifi, revealed this in an interview with Le Parisien. Al-Khelaifi said: “We have decided for another option as new manager – the best option for our tactical idea.” It is understood that Christophe Galtier will be their new manager. Galtier, 55, led Nice to a fifth-place finish in Ligue 1 last campaign. PSG hope to announce his appointment this week, with the two clubs close to an agreement that will see the Parisian side pay £8.6m to buy the manager out of his contract.
