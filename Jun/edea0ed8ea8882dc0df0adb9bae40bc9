The federal government has charged youths in Cross River State to do all they can to justify the huge expenses on their training. Over the weekend, 540 unemployed youths across the 18 LGAs of the state were selected for various vocational skills training by the National Directorate for Employment (NDE). Director General of NDE, Mallam Abubakar Nuhu Fikpo made the charge at the flag off the selection in Calabar. Represented by the State Coordinator of NDE, Udam Gabriel Ugbashi, the Director-General asked the youths to take their training seriously. “I want you all to take the various training seriously to justify the huge investment of the Federal Government.” He enjoined those selected to see themselves as privileged considering there are a vast population of unemployed youths seeking the same opportunity in the state. “It is meant for 360 unemployed youths who will participate in Basic Vocational skills training and 180 participants on Advanced Vocational Skills training across the 18 Local Government Areas of the State. “The skills include Domestic Skills like Fashion Design, Hair Dressing, and makeup while the technical skills include plumbing, television/radio repairs, GSM and Electrical installation.”
