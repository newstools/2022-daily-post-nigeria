Real Madrid’s new signing, Antonio Rudiger, has disagreed with England national team coach, Gareth Southgate over his comment on Manchester City’s Jack Grealish during the Three Lions’ UEFA Nations League tie against Germany in mid-week. Southgate had said that Grealish would have to become more tactically sound to become a regular player in the English starting XI after England’s 1-1 draw with Germany in the Nations League. But Rudiger, who recently joined Real Madrid from Chelsea, believes Grealish will play a key role in his position for the England team in the coming days, adding that the former Aston Villa star is a very dangerous player. According to the centre-back, Grealish had a real impact on his team from the moment he came onto the pitch against Germany. Speaking to the press, Rudiger said via The Mirror: “The England squad has great quality. It is like Saka comes out, Grealish comes in. I saw a lot of big, big names on the bench. “The English players are definitely getting better. You have to think about it like this, players like Rashford and Sancho didn’t even make the squad. “That tells you that you have a lot of depth in the English squad and you have big, big players like Harry Kane, Sterling and Grealish – big names, big players.” He added: “I think Grealish gave the team a real impact – because he came on and he gave good one-v-ones and everything. He is a very dangerous player and those sorts of players are going to win you games.”
