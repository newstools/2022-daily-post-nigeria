Terrorists, on Saturday, reportedly released five male and six female abducted Kaduna-Abuja train victims. Gunmen suspected to be terrorists had on March 28, 2022, abducted Kaduna-Abuja train passengers, after killing nine passengers, and wounding others. Eleven victims were released on Saturday, after reaching an agreement with the Federal Government. The terrorists had threatened to start killing the victims if the Federal Government refuses to negotiate with them. The Publisher of Desert Herald, Tukur Mamu, who served as a mediator, confirmed the development. He said his sources confided in him that the terrorists released the male captives on health grounds, adding that the women were among the vulnerable in captivity. “It was expected initially that all the abducted women will be released in the first batch while negotiations for the release of the remaining victims will continue but the abductors had cut down the number of women they initially agreed to release because the Nigerian Government had demanded that they include those with life-threatening injuries among the released,” he said At the time of filing this report, the names of the released victims had not been confirmed.
