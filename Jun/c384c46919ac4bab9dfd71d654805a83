Former Imo State Governor, Rochas Okorocha, on Tuesday, completed the presidential screening of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC. Okorocha completed the screening amid doubts he would not make it following his arrest and detention by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC. The former Imo State governor was arrested by the anti-graft agency and kept in detention since Tuesday, over alleged fraud. A Federal High Court had on Tuesday granted him bail in the sum of N500 million, after which the Abuja Court ordered that the Imo West Senator be whisked away by the EFCC and kept until his bail conditions are met. But Okorocha, amid all odds, attended the screening, after which he thanked his supporters for standing by him and insisted that Nigeria needs a detribalised leader like him to pilot the affairs of the nation. Speaking on his case with the anti-graft agency, the former Imo State governor promised to address the media in the coming days. The APC presidential primary election and national convention is expected to be held between June 6 to 8, 2022. And Okorocha battles the likes of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Senate President Ahmad Lawan, former Lagos State Governor, Ahmed Tinubu and former Rivers State Governor, Chibuike Amaechi.
