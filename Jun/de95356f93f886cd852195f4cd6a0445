Waziri Yakubu Gobir, in Ilorin, on Wednesday, declared his ambition to contest for the governorship office of Kwara State in the 2023 general elections. He is vying for the governorship seat on the platform of the Young Progressives Party, YPP. At a press conference in Ilorin at the party’s secretariat, Yakubu Gobir condemned the current situation of affairs saying, “for too long, our beloved State, like most of Nigeria, has wallowed in abject penury and insecurity, whilst a very few corners the commonwealth and holds the rest hostage. “From N100m nomination forms to delegates who pay allegiance to the fattest wads of hundreds of dollars, politics has become a criminal enterprise, where only the most corrupt thrive.” Gobir described the scenario as a grand design to scheme out the most upright and most competent from participating in the governance of the country, thereby perpetuating a kleptocracy. The YPP candidate charged the people of Kwara State, especifically the youth, to rise up as leaders of today and not tomorrow “as you have been misled for so long, because the current leaders do not rate you so, except when paying lip service or using you as agents of destruction. “The ‘O to ge’ movement which you successfully led in 2019 was an eye-opener for many Kwarans, but what happened to you afterwards?” “Kwara State has never been more divided than it is at this very moment, ethno-political conflict, social decay and squandered resources have widened the gap between the haves and have-nots, fuelling resentment and a glaring economic divide,” Gobir added. He urged the youths and members of the party to get their PVCs within the next 30 days for the battle ahead. Dele Ogunbiyi, the State Chairman of the party, described Gobir’s declaration as a big plus for the party.
