Paris Saint-Germain are reportedly set to play forward Lionel Messi in a different position come next season, with the anticipated arrival of a new manager. Messi shocked the football world when he left his boyhood club Barcelona for PSG last summer following the expiration of his contract. The Argentine captain encountered a somewhat difficult debut season at PSG, taking time to adapt to the change in settings. Messi was predominantly used on the right-hand side of PSG’s attack under manager Mauricio Pochettino last season, making 34 appearances, scoring 11 goals and providing 15 assists. However, according to FootMercato (via PSGTalk), the seven-time Ballon d’Or winner may be used as a number 10 heading into next season, with PSG’s advisor Luis Campos looking to instil OGC Nice coach Christophe Galtier as manager. Galtier had been linked with the Parc des Princes job to take over from Pochettino. Campos reportedly wants to implement a 3-5-2 formation with Galtier in charge at PSG and that will see Messi move into a number 10 role.
