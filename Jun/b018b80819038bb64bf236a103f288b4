The police in Ogun State have reacted to an alarm on Thursday that gunmen invaded Obada, Oke-Ata and other parts of Ewekoro and Abeokuta North Local Government Areas of the State. Police said the false alarm was raised by some unknown persons in the early hour of the day. The Ogun State Police image-maker, Abimbola Oyeyemi said the alarmist went further to ask schools in those areas to close and send their pupils to their different homes for safety. Oyeyemi said the Ogun Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, had quickly deployed some officers and men of the command to the area, saying the cops found nothing of such happening anywhere around the mentioned places. The command appealed to members of the public “to discountenance the false information as nothing of such is happening anywhere in Ogun State.” Oyeyemi urged residents to go about their lawful businesses without the fear of any form of harassment or intimidation. He warned those behind such false alarm to desist from it, adding that the tactical teams of the command have been activated to bring them to book. “Raising false alarm to cause panic in the mind of the general public is criminal and such barbaric act will no longer be tolerated,” he stressed.
