The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC has deployed 9,757 officers for the Ekiti gubernatorial election scheduled for Saturday, across the 2,445 polling units of the state. This was disclosed on Friday, by the Assistant National Commandant, NSCDC, ACG Haruna Lawal, during a press conference at the State Headquarters of the corps in Ado Ekiti, the state capital. Abubakar enjoined the NSCDC Security personnel covering the election across the 16 local government areas of the state to be professional. He equally counselled its officers to relate with all civilians and other security agencies during the election tomorrow. He also warned them against raising issues with other security agencies or engage in activities that can put the force into disrepute. The NSCDC listed the units of the NSCDC to be deployed to include the SWAT, Female SWAT, ARM Squad, Anti Terrorism among others. He also added that NSCDC officers were deployed from states like Osun, Ogun, Kwara, Edo and Ondo. “We are deploying nothing less than 9,747 officers to all the polling units across the state “You are not deployed just for election alone, we are going to protect INEC facilities, government buildings across the state, power stations and all of them. “One fundamental thing that you need to know is that you must work hand-in-hand with other security agencies. “Civil defence is a critical stakeholder as far as election duty is concerned. We can’t do it alone, even the lead agency can not do it alone, that’s why we are all here. “Secondly, don’t take side with any political party, you are not here to play politics, you are here to safeguard a system, to protect the electorates, yourself, democracy. “You are there to provide security at the polling units, you are not there to guard anybody to vote, INEC officials will do so.”
