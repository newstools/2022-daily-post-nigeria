Super Eagles head coach Jose Peseiro insists the team will get better under his tutelage even as he praised his players for their efforts in the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Sierra Leone and Sao Tome and Principe. The three-time African champions started the qualifying campaign with a nervy 2-1 win against Sierra Leone at the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja. Peseiro’s charges then went full throttle annihilating Sao Tome 10-0 in their matchday two encounters in Agadir, Morocco on Monday. The win was the biggest recorded in international football by Nigeria. The Super Eagles top Group A with six points from two games and in a good position to secure the ticket to Cote d’ lvoire 2023. An elated Peseiro took to social media to show his excitement about his team’s achievement. “We achieved our goal of points won, grew as a group and conquered a historical record, always based on fundamental values: team spirit and mutual help. “We made the Nigerian nation proud. We are focused on improving our work to achieve our goals,” the Portuguese wrote on his Twitter handle on Wednesday. The Super Eagles will next host the Djurtus of Guinea-Bissau in their next game in the qualifiers in September.
