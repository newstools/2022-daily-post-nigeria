There appears to be a crack in the leadership of the Nigeria Labour Congress in Rivers State. This follows the announcement that the vice chairman of the State NLC, Emecheta Chuku has been appointed as the Acting Chairman of the Union by the state Administrative Council. However, majority of the members of the SAC and State Executive Council of the NLC quickly convened an emergency meeting to discuss the matter. The union leaders were, however, on Thursday locked out of their state headquarters by operatives of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence corps in what some of labour leaders said was a move to prevent them from holding the meeting. The meeting venue was then taken to another place where the State Executive Council and State Administration Council of the Nigeria Labour Congress in Rivers “passed a vote of confidence” on Beatrice Itubo as the chairman of the union. Reading out the resolution reached at the end of the NLC SEC and SAC meeting in Port Harcourt, the State Secretary of the NLC, Mathew Olabe condemned the action of “some members of the union to subvert the legitimate leadership of the Union”. Olabe also vowed that the union will “investigate” alleged “forging of signatures of some members” to robe them into the scheme. The NLC Secretary also condemned the sealing of the Labour House in Port Harcourt by security operatives. The Labour leaders proceeded into a meeting with the commissioner of police Friday Eboka at the command’s headquarters after the SEC and SAC meeting. Itubo was last elected as the Governorship candidate of the Labour party in Rivers state which has led to recent agitation for her to resign from her position as NLC chairman.
