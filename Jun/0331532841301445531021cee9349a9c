The Deputy Governor of Ebonyi State, Kelechi Eric Igwe, has denied his alleged defection from the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, to the Labour Party, LP. DAILY POST gathered that there have been rumours making the rounds in the state that Igwe had allegedly dumped the APC for the LP to protest the denial of his senatorial ambition by the leadership of the party in the state. Igwe, in a statement signed and made available to journalists in Abakaliki through his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Monday Uzor, said he has no intention to dump APC for LP, and that, on no account will he (Igwe) abandon his boss, David Umahi at the peak of the expiration of their 8 years tenure. He said: “The attention of the Deputy Governor of Ebonyi State, Chief Eric Kelechi Igwe has been drawn to a social media post alleging that the Deputy Governor is planning to dump All Progressive Congress, APC, for the Labour Party. “The report is not only false but a deliberate attempt to smear the office and personality of the Deputy Governor. It is a deliberate attempt to heat up the polity through dangerous speculations capable of undermining the peace in the state. “The deputy governor remains a strong and bonafide member of the All Progressives Congress APC and has no intention of dumping the party whether now or later. “The Deputy Governor has enormous responsibilities occupying his time especially, how to assist the Governor David Umahi to successfully anchor the transition programme. “The general public and in particular members of our great party should disregard such unfounded rumour being peddled by those who are envious of the progress the party is making,” he stated.
