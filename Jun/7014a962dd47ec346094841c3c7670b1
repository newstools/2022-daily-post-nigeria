Shehu Sani, a former federal lawmaker, on Wednesday urged the Nigerian Senate to extend their support to Yoruba Nation campaigner, Sunday Adeyemo, also known as Sunday Igboho. Sani said this while reacting to the Senate’s decision to send a high-powered delegation to meet with Senator Ike Ekweremadu in London, United Kingdom (UK). DAILY POST recalls that Ekweremadu, who is the former Deputy Senate President, was detained alongside his wife over alleged “organ harvesting” in the UK. The Senate’s decision was made after they met behind closed doors for two hours on Wednesday. The Senate President, Dr. Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, commended defence lawyers to Ekweremadu and his wife, who he said were working hard to get them out of detention. Reacting, Sani, in a tweet via his Twitter handle, insisted that the response of the National Assembly over Ekweremadu’s issue is in the right direction. He tweeted: “Ekweremadu deserves all the necessary consular support he needs. The response of the NASS is in the right direction. But same should be extended to Sunday Igboho.” Recall that Igboho was arrested and detained in Cotonou, Benin Republic, in July 2021. The agitator was arrested while attempting to travel to Germany via Cotonou. This was after he fled Nigeria, having been declared wanted by the Department of State Services, DSS, for allegedly stockpiling arms in his Ibadan residence.
