As the All Progressives Congress, APC, commences its Special convention, a presidential aspirant, Yahaya Bello, has warned the party against excluding him from the ballot. Bello warned that excluding him from the ballot would be trouble for APC. The Kogi State governor disclosed this while briefing State House Correspondents after his closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari. Bello said: “I’m a free citizen of the party, a qualified member of the party. I bought a form and was cleared to participate in the election, and there is no reason for me to be excluded from the ballot. “If they do so, then that is a recipe for bigger trouble for the party. “However, I don’t think it’s a decision of the party but that of a few elites who may decide to use their positions to suppress the so-called minority, but I want to prove in this country that I’m not in the minority. “We have the majority, and I belong to the younger generation. I belong to the generation of those that are oppressed, and they are saying their voice must be heard. I believe getting into that arena today, and I will win overwhelmingly.”
