Vice president, Yemi Osinbajo has confirmed he will contest in the presidential primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Osinbajo was the last of the 22 aspirants to give his speech at the special convention holding at the Eagles Square in Abuja. “Our dear delegates, when you vote tonight make sure your votes carry the prayer, future of your children. “You cannot wish this country well and vote for someone you do not believe in. “Our circumstances will not afford the next President to learn on the job. And I will be ready from day one. “In discharging my duties as VP, I have been prepared for the task ahead and I will be ready from day one. “It is for this reason that I, Osinbajo, present myself to you, our distinguished delegates, for the presidential ticket of our party,” the Vice President said. Osinbajo’s decision to go ahead and contest comes after six aspirants stepped down for the National Leader of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. Before his speech, there were rumours that Osinbajo would also step down for Tinubu.
