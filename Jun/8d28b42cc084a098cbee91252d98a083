The National Assembly, on Monday in Abuja, asked the National Industrial Court, NIC, to allow an out-of-court settlement in a suit instituted against it and three others, challenging the poor payment of judges in the country. The NASS, through its counsel, Mr. Charles Yoila, told Justice Osatohanmwen Obaseki-Osagie that the Assembly is interested in an out-of-court settlement policy because of the nature of the matter. The counsel pleaded with the court to grant an adjournment so as to enable parties in the matter to sit at a round table for discussion of an amicable resolution. He told the judge that the NASS would have opted for an early resolution of the matter but for the strike embarked upon by workers of the organization, adding that at the moment, the main gate of the Assembly is under lock and key. At Monday’s proceeding, Chief Adegboyega Awomolo, SAN, who led 33 other senior advocates, had sought to argue the originating summon in the suit that was filed by another senior lawyer, Sebastian Hon, SAN, in line with the practice direction of the court. However, the hearing could not proceed because of the absence of the Revenue Mobilization, Allocation and Fiscal Commission; the Attorney-General of the Federation; and the National Judicial Council, who were not represented by legal practitioners. Awomolo, however, conceded to the request for an out-of-court settlement sought by the NASS but on the ground that an early hearing is granted. In a short ruling, Justice Obaseki-Osagie adjourned the matter to June 22 for a report of settlement by the parties in the matter. Prominent among Senior Advocates in attendance were Chief Kanu Agabi, Mike Ozekhome, Sebastian Hon, Godwin Obla, Emeka Ngige, Hassan Liman, Tawo Tawo, Emeka Etiaba, Paul Ogbole, Chief Henry Akunebu, Audu Anuga and John Asoluka.
