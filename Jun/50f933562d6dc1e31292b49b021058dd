An association of Women Civil Servants in Jigawa State on Thursday cried out over the alleged marginalization of women in the state civil service. Furaira Abdullahi, chairperson of the group in a statement, called on the Jigawa State Government to render equal opportunities to women in the state workforce. According to her, they are qualified to hold any public office just as their male counterparts. She said women have held strategic positions efficiently in some parts of the country and wondered why they are being neglected, despite their capabilities and paper qualifications. Abdullahi said girls are always facing issues with regard to western education in the state due to cultural practices but called on the government and relevant stakeholders to put hands on deck to address the menace. She said though in Jigawa State, the government is trying to strike the balance of equal opportunities, rights and privileges amongst the workforce as far as equity and social justice is concerned.
