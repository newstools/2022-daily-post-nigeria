Speaking at a High Court in Abuja, where he was arraigned, Nwachukwu said he never hit the deceased singer. “Let me tell the whole world, I have suffered a lot. I have been abandoned. What killed my wife was cancer of the lungs, I didn’t hit my wife. “Cancer of the lungs killed my wife, Osinachi Nwachukwu, so I’m suffering for what I do not know, “ he spoke while being moved from the courtroom. Nwachukwu was accused of killing his wife following domestic violence he subjected her to while she was alive. To this end, the office of the Attorney General of the Federation, AGF, had arraigned Nwachukwu on a 23-count charge bordering on domestic violence and homicide. The Abuja National Hospital had performed an autopsy on Osinachi but the result was handed over to the police.
