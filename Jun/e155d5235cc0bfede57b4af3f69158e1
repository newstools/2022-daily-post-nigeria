One person has lost his life while several others were injured in a lone accident that occurred on Saturday in Jalingo, the capital of Taraba State. The lone accident, which involved an 18-seater bus with registration number, Taraba: JAL 09 XA, occurred at Barde way in the Jalingo metropolis. Eyewitnesses, who spoke with DAILY POST, at the scene of the accident said the bus which was conveying persons from a wedding, was at speed when the driver lost control. An attempt made by the driver of the bus to avoid falling into a drainage, according to him failed. While one person was said to have died on the spot, other occupants of the bus were said to have sustained various degrees of injuries. Another eyewitness said of “most of those who sustained injuries surviving, is very slim because most of them were unconscious.” Apart from being unconscious, the eyewitness, who only gave his name as Adams, said some of the occupants of the bus “will hardly survive because of the deep cuts they sustained.” Though both the deceased and those injured have been evacuated to the hospital, blood and human parts were allegedly at the scene of the accident. A security operative was seen at the scene of the accident trying to facilitate the removal of the bus.
