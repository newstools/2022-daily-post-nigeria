Amnesty International (AI) has condemned the killing of dozens of worshippers including women and children in Ondo State. DAILY POST reports that gunmen attacked the St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo on Sunday after invading the premises. The Police said some of the assailants disguised as congregants, fired bullets from AK-47 rifles. Three unexploded Improvised Explosive Devices at the scene (IEDs) have been safely recovered. A statement on Monday by AI Director in Nigeria Osai Ojigho said what happened “reveals the impunity enjoyed by gunmen on the rampage across Nigeria”. Ojigho told the authorities to do everything they can to ensure the perpetrators of the Owo crime face justice. The activist noted that the brutal attack shows a complete disregard for the right to life. “Under international human rights law, Nigeria has a duty to protect the right to life of its people in all circumstances. “Victims and their families have a right to know the truth about this shooting and to be provided with justice and reparations.” AI charged the Nigerian judiciary to immediately launch a thorough and impartial investigation to identify the killers. The statement further demanded their prosecution and trial, “without recourse to the death penalty.”
