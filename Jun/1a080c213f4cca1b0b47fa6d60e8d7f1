The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential running mate, Ifeanyi Okowa, says he is an Igbo man and part of the Southeast. Okowa, who is the governor of Delta State, said his emergence as the PDP presidential running mate does not stop the Igbos from agitating for the presidency. He spoke on Friday evening while featuring on Arise TV, in response to the reaction of many political pundits regarding his ethnicity. According to Okowa: “Being from the South-South, I’m also an Igbo man. “I fit into all the divides. My brothers in the South-East, I’m part of them. I’m also part of the South-South. “But this does not stop the agitation in the future for the Igbos to have the presidency of this country.” Okowa is an ‘Ika’ from the Owa-Alero community in Delta State. Ika is a subgroup of the Igbo tribe and is predominantly found in Delta and Edo States. The PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar had unveiled Okowa as his running mate on Wednesday. Following the announcement, some groups accused Okowa of betraying the Southern part of the country.
