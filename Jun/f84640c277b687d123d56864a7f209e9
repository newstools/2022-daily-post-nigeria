Super Eagles assistant coach, Finidi George expects the team to do well under new head coach, Jose Peseiro. The three-time African champions earned huge plaudits despite losing 2-1 to Mexico in Peseiro’s first game. The Super Eagles dominated the second half of the game, and were unlucky not to get at least a draw. Peseiro’s team had just two training sessions before the Mexico game, but have now spent much time together heading into their second friendly against Ecuador. Having worked closely with the Portuguese for the past one week, Finidi, a member of the Super Eagles side that won the 1994 Africa Cup of Nations title in Tunisia is confident the team will enjoy a successful reign under the former Venezuela and Saudi Arabia coach. “We have had a couple of sessions even while in Dallas. Personally, I like it. I would say we are rebuilding. The rebuilding process has started. We will see how we can push the players.It’s been good so far. Let’s see how the second game will go,” Finidi told NFF TV. “He has done well. It’s not easy, just a week with the players. He is letting them know what he wants from them, bit by bit. “I think by the time we start the qualifiers, the players will know what is expected of them and try to do their best for the country,” he added. Finidi also spoke about his expectations ahead of Thursday’s friendly against La Tri of Ecuador. “It’s a rebuilding process. A draw will not be a bad result, victory will also be good for us. We would like to go back home with a good result,” he added.
