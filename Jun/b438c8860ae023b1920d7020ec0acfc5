The Overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church, Pastor Tunde Bakare, on Sunday disclosed why he got zero votes at the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential primary election. Pastor Bakare said he got zero votes at the APC primary due to his refusal to compromise on his values. He explained that he refused to play certain kinds of politics; hence he got zero votes. Bakare disclosed this while addressing his members on the topic “A New Nigeria is possible.” He urged Nigerians to rally round Tinubu to transform Nigeria if elected president. According to Bakare: “Our heads remain unbowed because we did not compromise on the values that are integral to building a New Nigeria. “For us, the means has always been as important as the end. This is why we confidently wear our “zero votes” as a badge of “zero tolerance for a certain kind of politics. “This is not the work of just one man or woman or just one party, but the calling upon every Nigerian worthy of the name.” He expressed hopes that God would bless Nigeria with leaders that love justice and not money.
