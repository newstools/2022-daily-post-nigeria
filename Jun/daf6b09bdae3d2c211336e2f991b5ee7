Former lawmaker, Senator Shehu Sani, has mocked Vice President Yemi Osinbajo after former Lagos State Governor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, emerged as the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Sani claimed that Osinbajo would now be called a ‘gulder boy’ after losing the APC presidential ticket to Tinubu. According to him, prior to the APC presidential primary, Osinbajo was called a star boy, adding that failure is an orphan. He disclosed this in a tweet via his Twitter handle on Wednesday. Sani tweeted, “Before the elections, Osinbajo was called a StarBoy. Now he may be called a Guinness or Gulder Boy; failure is an orphan.” DAILY POST reports that Tinubu had scored a total of 1,271 votes to defeat Osinbajo, who polled 235 votes and former Minister of Transportation, Mr Chibuike Amaechi, who got 316 votes and others.
