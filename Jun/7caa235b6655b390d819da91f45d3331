The Yoruba socio-political organization, Afenifere, has condemned the Zamfara State Governor, Bello Matawalle’s self-defense call in the State. Afenifere said asking residents to carry guns was not the solution to security challenges. Matawalle had directed residents of the State to procure guns in self-defense. Matawalle-led State Government had directed the State Police Commissioner, Mr. Ayuba Elkanah to issue licenses to residents of the State who are qualified to use guns for self-defense. Condemning the directive, Afenifere’s spokesman, Jared Ajayi, said such an order showed the failure of the government. In a statement he signed, Ajayi recounted how bandits killed two people and abducted 22 others in Rafin Daji area of Abaji in Abuja last week, amid several other attacks across the country. The statement reads partly: “The situation had reached such a height that Zamfara State government, joining its Katsina State counterpart, asked residents of the State to ‘buy guns to defend themselves’ against terrorists who are making life difficult for them.” Afenifere decried the step taken by Zamfara State government maintaining that asking everyone to carry gun is not the solution to the problem. “If anything, such a directive is an open declaration of failure on the part of the government. “This is why we are strongly advocating for the establishment of State Police,” he said.
