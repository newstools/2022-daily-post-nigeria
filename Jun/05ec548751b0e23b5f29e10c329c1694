The opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP will in the next few hours, announce the Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa as the running mate of the party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. Atiku, former Vice President of Nigeria made the announcement on Thursday at the party’s headquarters in Abuja. This was contrary to the reports earlier making the rounds that the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike would emerge as the credible running mate of Atiku. The presidential candidate, while speaking at the party’s headquarters, said the running mate is billed to start work with immediate effect to ensure that the party retains power in the next elections.
