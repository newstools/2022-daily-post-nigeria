Jumoke Oduwole, Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Ease of Doing Business, has urged Nigerian youths to join political parties, actively participate and vote wisely in the February 2023 general elections. Oduwole stated this during the 2022 programme on “This Generation Conference” on Sunday in Abuja. She said that next year’s general elections were the perfect year for youths to redefine the type of government and governance they desired. According to her, the youth must vote wisely or they will continue to “Japa” (Run away) to strange lands in search of what they could easily get here in Nigeria. “2023, the power to redefine Nigeria is in the hands of our youths. Just as the theme of the year’s conference is to ‘Take a Stand’, I urge the youth to truly take a stand in politics come 2023. “Just as we have heard from all the brilliant speakers, politics is a dirty game they all say, but the power to change politics to a decent game lies in our hands. “If we continue to run away, we would all continue to complain, but just as I have taken a stand in politics as a young girl, I urge us all to join politics, get active, and participate. “I want a better Nigeria for myself, my children and their unborn generations and even for my parents now,” she said.
