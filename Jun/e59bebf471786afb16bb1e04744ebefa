Shehu Sani, a socio-political commentator, has reacted to the call by Ayodele Fayose, former Governor of Ekiti State, that the south should produce the next president in 2023. Sani urged Fayose to calm down on agitation for rotation of the presidency. Fayose has said the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, should give room for power rotation. The PDP chieftain said the party’s constitution provides room for rotational presidency. He said rotational presidency would ensure equity, justice, and fairness within the party. Referring to a comment by the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, Fayose said: “Awa South lo kan.” He said: “The PDP Constitution provides for a rotational Presidency. Section 3(c) provides that the Party shall pursue its aims & objectives by “adhering to the policy of the rotation & zoning of Party & Public elective offices in pursuance of the principle of equity,justice and fairness.” Reacting to Fayose’s comment, Sani tweeted: “Calm down Big Bro; delegates no dey read constitution, na mint dem de read.” Meanwhile, Fayose’s comment could be seen as a deviation from PDP’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. While Atiku hails from the North, Tinubu is from the Southern part of the country.
