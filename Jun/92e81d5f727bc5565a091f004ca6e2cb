Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has dropped his Deputy, Engineer Rauf Olaniyan ahead of the 2023 general elections. DAILY POST gathered from sources close to the Agodi Government House that the Governor has picked Barrister Bayo Lawal as the replacement for Olaniyan. Makinde and Olaniyan were jointly elected as governor and deputy governor on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), during the 2019 general elections. Lawal, who is yet to be announced officially, is the Chairman of Oyo State Housing Corporation. Makinde is from Ibadan, the State capital, while Olaniyan and Lawal are from Oke-Ogun geo-political zone. The source said that the governor is going to announce Lawal as his running mate any moment from now. Olaniyan had earlier said that only God will determine his next political action. Olaniyan, few days later, however, said that no fewer than five political parties are calling him to contest on their platforms.
