Former president of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan has not been screened by the All Progressives Congress (APC), ahead of the party’s presidential primary. Jonathan failed to appear before the Chief John Odigie-Oyegun panel on Monday and Tuesday, the two days set aside for the screening in Abuja. Among those screened on Tuesday were Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Senator Godswill Akpabio, Gov. Yahaya Bello, Senate President Ahmad Lawan, former House Speaker Dimeji Bankole, Gov. Kayode Fayemi, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu and others. Despite speculations that Jonathan may have submitted his nomination and expression of interest forms and might be screened, he was not anywhere close to the venue of the exercise. DAILY POST reports that President Muhammadu Buhari has asked governors elected under the APC platform, to allow him pick his successor. Buhari made this request during a meeting with the Progressives Governors’ Forum in Abuja, on Tuesday.
