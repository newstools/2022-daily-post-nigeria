The Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) Board on Friday commended President Muhammadu Buhari for rescinding the Federal Government’s decision to withdraw the national teams from international basketball. NBBF President, Mr Musa Kida, in a statement on Friday, said he was glad to see a decision reached after the back and forth and the reversal is a major victory for basketball. “We recognise that some of the actions of the stakeholders and their effects are regrettable.” He further stated that vital lessons have been learnt and stakeholders are now committed to close ranks in the overall interest of the game. He explained that there can be no viable grassroots development without international exposure. Kida added that the NBBF has agreed to set up a high-powered and all-inclusive committee to reconcile every genuine grievance amongst stakeholders.
