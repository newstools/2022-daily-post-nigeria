Sen. Abdullahi Adamu, the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Chairman, says Sen. Bola Tinubu, the party’s 2023 presidential candidate, is APC’s project. Adamu said this on Thursday in Abuja while speaking with newsmen at the Abuja residence of Tinubu, where he went to congratulate him for emerging as the party’s presidential flagbearer. He, who was accompanied by members of its National Working Committee (NWC) on the visit, noted that action speaks louder than voice. DAILY POST reports that Tinubu, one of the leaders of the APC, emerged as its 2023 presidential candidate at its just concluded Special Convention and Presidential Primary Election on Wednesday.
