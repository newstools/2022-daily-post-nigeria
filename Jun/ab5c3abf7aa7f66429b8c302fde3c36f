Christian Eriksen is delaying his decision over a potential move to Manchester United this summer, according to the UK Mirror. The 30-year-old is now a free agent after his short-term contract with Brentford expired this summer. Eriksen made an immediate impact with the Bees, playing a key role in helping Thomas Frank’s side comfortably avoid relegation. The Denmark international is now attracting attention from other Premier League clubs like United, Leicester City, Brentford, Everton, Newcastle and Tottenham. But it is believed Eriksen is delaying his decision, because he wants to see how United progress in the early stages of the transfer window. The Red Devils are yet to bring in new faces, but are reportedly on the verge of agreeing a £68 million deal for Barcelona’s Frenkie de Jong, who is one of Erik ten Hag’s priority transfer targets. United are unable to offer Champions League football to any new signings following their sixth-placed finish in the Premier League last term.
