The Super Eagles trained on Sunday night in Abuja ahead of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier, with the trio of Joe Aribo, Calvin Bassey and Shehu Abdullahi missing. Aribo and Bassey featured in the team’s recent friendlies against Mexico and Ecuador. Abdullahi on the other hand failed to secure entry visa to the United States of America for the games. The trio are expected to link up with their teammates in camp before the qualifiers. The likes of Ahmed Musa, Samuel Chukwueze, Victor Osimhen, Zaidu Sanusi, Oghenekaro Etebo and Frank Onyeka, who all missed the US tour, were part of the training on Sunday. The team will have another training session on Monday. The former African champions will host the Leone Stars of Sierra Leone at the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja on Thursday. The West Africans will then travel to Marrakech, Morocco for the matchday two clash against Sao Tome and Principe next week Monday.
