The Modibbo Adama University (MAU), Yola, Adamawa State, has demoted three professors in what the university described as renewed efforts to instill discipline. The Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the university in charge of Administration, Professor Muhammed Ja’afaru, who announced this on Saturday, said the demotion was part of steps the MAU has taken to protect the university community against individuals stepping out of bounds. Ja’afaru who said the three affected professors were demoted for misconduct, did not specify their misdeeds, nor did he mention their names, but he stressed that their offences had nothing to do with sexual exploitation. In an interview with newsmen, Professor Ja’afaru explained, “We’ve not been getting issue of sexual assault around the university, no, the professors were not punished for that.” He disclosed however that part of Professor Abdullahi Tukur’s legacies as VC had been the formulation of a sexual exploitation policy to guide the university should any case come up, especially as it tends to be common in many other institutions of higher learning. “We have a policy against sexual harassment. There is a policy in place now. It is a wholistic one to protect all sexes from exploitation,” he said.
