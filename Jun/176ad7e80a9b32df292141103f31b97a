Bayern Munich have insisted that Robert striker, Lewandowski is going nowhere this summer. This is despite the player sending messages to the Bavarians and the optimism from Barcelona about signing the player. Former President of the club, Uli Hoeness, told Sport1 that Bayern Munich are relying on Lewandowski for next season. He said that the Poland international is part of the new team being intensively worked on by Bayern Munich, adding that the player and his agent are angry because they cannot get what they wanted. “The new team is being worked on intensively. If everything that was presented to me last week works out, we will have an attractive team next year with Lewandowski. “Things didn’t go exactly the way he and his agent wanted. That’s why they are angry,” Hoeness said. He advised everyone involved in the transfer saga to be objective and not let issues escalate. “The sun will shine on Lewandowski and Bayern again. It has always been like that,” he added.
