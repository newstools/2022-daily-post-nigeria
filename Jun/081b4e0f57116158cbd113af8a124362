Romelu Lukaku was moved to tears after Chelsea agreed a season-long loan deal with Inter Milan, according to Gazzetta dello Sport. Inter will pay the Blues a £7 million loan fee plus add-ons. Lukaku himself will make sacrifices, by taking a 35% pay cut on his wages of £325,000 a week at Stamford Bridge. The 29-year-old returns to the San Siro, only one year after joining Chelsea in a club-record deal worth £97.5million. During his time there, he netted 15 goals in 44 matches. Lukaku then disrupted the club’s campaign by giving a TV interview in December, in which he criticised manager Thomas Tuchel. It has now been revealed that Lukaku became emotional when informed by his lawyer Sebastien Ledure that a breakthrough had been reached in negotiations between Chelsea and Inter on Tuesday. It came after talks stalled on Monday when Inter president Steven Zhang attempted to restructure the deal.
