The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has said sensitive electoral materials will no longer be routed through the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN. INEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, said INEC would no longer keep sensitive electoral materials with the CBN, starting from the forthcoming governorship election in Ekiti State. Speaking in Abuja, Yakubu explained that the move was aimed at preventing electoral materials from being compromised. Some Nigerians had called for the removal of sensitive electoral materials from Nigeria’s apex bank after a group purchased the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential forms for the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele. Nigerians asked President Muhammadu Buhari to sack Emefiele over the purchase of APC presidential forms. However, Emefiele dismissed knowledge of the forms.
