Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, has directed the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) to get involved in the manhunt for the gunmen involved in Sunday’s attack and massacre at a church in Owo, Ondo State. The minister gave the directive at the decoration of five Deputy Commandant-Generals of the NSCDC. NSCDC’s spokesman, Olusola Odumosu, stated on Wednesday in Abuja that Aregbesola urged the NSCDC to play direct roles rather than complementary ones in confronting bandits and terrorists. “I charge you to launch your arsenal against the perpetrators of the Owo church attack. “Play a direct role and not a complementary role by synergising with other security agencies to fish out the criminals and let’s bring them to justice. “You have no excuse whatsoever not to perform going by the level of training you have received both locally and internationally,” Odumosu quoted the minister as saying. Aregbesola said there was a great need to put an end to crimes in the country and called for the application of “grassroots intelligence gathering’’, to secure the country. In his remarks at the event, NSCDC Commandant-General, Ahmed Audi, assured the minister of the corps’ readiness to tackle insecurity in collaboration with other security agencies. “The service will not disappoint the Ministry of Interior and by extension the Federal Republic of Nigeria,’’ he assured. Audi appreciated the Civil Defence, Correctional, Fire and Immigration Services Board for promoting the senior officers. He charged the decorated DCGs to improve on their performances to achieve the vision and mission of the Corps
