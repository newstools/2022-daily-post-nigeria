Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, the Ooni of Ife, on Monday, condemned the killings of innocent worshippers at St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo on Sunday. DAILY POST reports that the church was attacked yesterday by unknown gunmen, leading to the killing of scores of worshippers. In a statement posted via his Instagram account, Ogunwusi stated in strong terms that the Yoruba people cannot be overrun in their homes, adding that they are ready to defend themselves against “external invaders.” The statement partly read, “What occurred yesterday was a gruesome massacre dastardly targeted at turning Yorubaland into a war zone. However, we the descendants of Oduduwa, although peace-loving, cannot be overrun in our own homes, do not be mistaken, we have the capacity and are prepared and ready to defend ourselves against all external invaders.” “I implore the six governors across the South-West region and their brothers nationwide as well as the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.)-led Federal Government, to live up to their oaths of securing Nigerians and ensuring safety for all citizens irrespective of their age, sex, religion or tribe.”
