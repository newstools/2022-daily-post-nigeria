A former House of Representatives member, Mr Ahmed Wadada has dumped the All Progressives Congress (APC). This is contained in a letter signed by Wadada and addressed to the APC Ward Chairman, Tudun Kofa, Keffi Local Government Area of Nasarawa State. A copy of the letter was made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Keffi on Wednesday. Wadada in the letter dated June 1, 2022, said his decision was due to the controversy that trailed the recently conducted Nasarawa West Senatorial District primary election which he withdrew from, in spite of being a frontrunner. He said the controversy had to do with alleged alterations to the party’s original delegates’ list for the election, an action he described as illegal and undemocratic.
