Nigerian forward, Asisat Oshoala says the Super Falcons are poised to win a record-extending 10th title at the 2022 Africa Women’s Cup of Nations in Morocco. The Super Falcons have won nine out of 11 editions of the WAFCON. Randy Waldrum’s charges have been pitted in Group C alongside South Africa, debutants, Botswana and Burundi for WAFCON 2022. The South Africans represented the toughest opposition in the group having won two of the last three meetings with the Super Falcons. Oshoala, however, insisted that they are not focusing on the Banyana Banyana alone. “I don’t think the opening game is a decider of the tournament, and by the way, it is not only South Africa we will be facing. It’s a whole tournament,” Oshoala told CAFOnline.com. “We are not going to be seated talking tough about just one team [South Africa]. Obviously, they are a very strong team, a very competitive one as well. Maybe the mindset of our team and theirs may not be the same, but we have the likes of Cameroon, Morroco, and other great teams in Africa to face. “We are just basically focused on working on ourselves and we are not so bothered about playing South Africa. When we get to the phase of playing them, we will cross it.” The Super Falcons will face South Africa in their opening game of the competition at the Prince Moulay Hassan Stadium in Rabat on July 4.
