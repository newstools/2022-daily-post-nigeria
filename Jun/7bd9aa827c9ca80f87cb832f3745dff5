Midfielder, Frenkie de Jong, has told Manchester United and Barcelona that he does not want to leave Camp Nou this summer. Manchester United and Barcelona have reached an initial agreement over a €65 million (£56m) fee plus add-ons for the former Ajax midfielder. The midfielder is United manager, Erik ten Hag’s first choice target for the summer transfer window, with the Red Devil’s new manager viewing the 25-year-old as a key part of his plans at Old Trafford. Barcelona had hoped to sell the midfielder for a fee closer to €100m (£86.4m) as they need the fund to finance their summer spending. Now Sports reports that De Jong could change Barcelona’s transfer plans as the Spanish club and United said that he has no intention of leaving this summer. The report claims that De Jong is unhappy with Catalan side’s attempt to sell him and is determined to stay at Camp Nou for another season.
