Presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, on Wednesday visited Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike at his residence. Channels TV reports that upon arrival, Peter Obi was taken inside where he met Wike in Port Harcourt, the state capital. The meeting was held behind closed doors. Peter Obi’s visit is coming four days after the Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi paid Governor Wike a visit. Wike is yet to react to the emergence of Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa as the Vice Presidential candidate of the PDP. The NWC had reportedly picked Wike as the perfect candidate to balance the ticket, however, Atiku Abubakar opted for Okowa. There are also reports that Governor Wike is set to dump the PDP. The duo, however, did not speak on the purpose of the meeting as newsmen were not granted access.
