Adamawa State Governor, Ahmadu Fintiri has freed six inmates serving various prison terms in five Correctional Centres across the State. The Governor did this in commemoration of this year’s June 12 Democracy Day, according to a statement from the Government House, Yola. The statement, signed and sent to DAILY POST Sunday morning by Fintiri’s Press Secretary, Humwashi Wonosikou, said the Governor exercised the powers conferred on him by Section 212 (i)(b) of Nigeria’s Constitution. Wonosikou added that Governor Fintiri also commuted the death sentence of another inmate to life imprisonment. He said the seven inmates are serving their terms in Yola old, Jada, Numan, Mubi, and Jimeta Correctional facilities. The Governor’s Press Secretary added that Fintiri acted in line with recommendations of the Council on the Prerogative of Mercy, and that it was part of efforts to decongest some of the overburdened Correctional Centres as Nigeria marks Democracy Day.
