The All Progressives Congress, APC, has been urged to place one of its presidential aspirants, Yahaya Bello on suicide watch. Reno Omokri, a socio-political commentator, alleged that Bello may be suffering from severe depression. In a tweet, the former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, wrote: “The APC should put Yahaya Bello on suicide watch. This may sound like a joke, but I’m deadly serious. “The man is experiencing severe depression right now. All the cash he spent down the drain. Meanwhile, Kogi workers and pensioners are waiting for him!” Prior to the commencement of the APC presidential primary election, there were insinuations that the Kogi State Governor was asked to step down from the presidential race. This, many believed, was the reason he angrily left a meeting of APC governors, a few days ago. However, the APC presidential aspirant insisted that he would not step down from the race. He, however, stressed that only President Muhammadu Buhari can ask him to step down.
