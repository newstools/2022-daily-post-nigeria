In this article from RecruitmentWing, a HR management company, we will look at some things that you should pay attention to when you are
interviewing for a job First, do not talk about your previous employers. Second, avoid talking about how much money you earn. Remember that an interviewer does not care about your salary or the amount of money you earn in a year. The only thing they care about is how well-trained and experienced you are. So don’t even think about it and just focus on what skills and competencies you have to offer the company in terms of experience and knowledge. Finally, don’t talk too much about yourself or your past experiences as it will show lack of interest from the interviewer and also make him feel uncomfortable (which isn’t good). Also avoid making jokes or other small talk during the interview. The interview is a crucial step in the recruitment process.
