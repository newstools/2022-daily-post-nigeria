The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for the Enugu State 2023 gubernatorial election, Mr Peter Mbah, has promised to run an all-inclusive government. He made this known while holding reconciliatory meetings with governorship aspirants of the party and former aspirants for other elective offices from the Enugu North Senatorial Zone in the just concluded primary elections of the party held in the State. DAILY POST had reported that prior to the commencement of the primary election, most of the aspirants stepped down for Mbah, who became the party’s flagbearer. At the meetings hosted by Mbah at his Enugu residence, he promised both the aspirants and the people of the State that if elected governor, he would prioritize the welfare and development of the people of the zone while ensuring that the people were not left behind in the administration. According to Mbah, the meetings were a signal to political traducers and cynics who never believed that a meeting point could come between him and the aspirants that he “and my brothers are dwelling in unity.” Speaking further, Mbah said the meetings were a pathway to peace and reconciliation while pledging his cooperation to sustain the newfound peace between them. “By these meetings, we are sending a strong message that we are united in our aspirations to make Enugu State better and greater,” Mbah said. At the meeting with the former governorship aspirants were Engr Erasmus Anike, Pastor Beloved Dan Anike, Dr. GOC Ajah, Hon. Chijioke Edeoga, Sir Christian Chinyeaka Ohaa, and Hon. Barr Nwabueze Ugwu, amongst others.
