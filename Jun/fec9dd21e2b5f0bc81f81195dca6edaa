An action group in Osogbo, capital of Osun State has warned the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP) gubernatorial candidate, Ademola Adeleke, against comments that are capable of threatening the peace of the state, especially at this crucial period. The Osogbo Development Action Group (ODAG) knocked Senator Adeleke for an alleged rejoinder credited to him that if elected as governor, he will not reclaim alleged land “usurped” by Osogbo. This was contained in a statement jointly signed by ODAG Coordinator, Ajani Lukman, General Secretary, Oladejo Shuaib and Public Relations Officer, Agboola Fadhilulahi, and made available to DAILY POST. ODAG said it was “disappointed by the choice of words of the said candidate claiming that he is not ready to reclaim the land “usurped” by Osogbo.” The nonpartisan group warned politicians especially those from the town to desist from hiding under the guise of the Osogbo Agenda to launch their political interests. ODAG condemned some individuals using the name of the town to score cheap political points whenever an election is approaching under the guise of the Osogbo agenda to cause disunity. “We equally advise any politician who may wish to promote his/her political party to do so without bringing the name of the town in the mud.” According to the ODAG, Osogbo would not trade any of her territorial heritages or any of her neighbouring communities for any reason. The group advised the PDP candidate to seek legal advice if in doubt rather than issuing unguarded statements capable of threatening the peace of the state. “We also strongly warn the said candidate and his co-travellers to desist from making provocative statements to forestall breakdown of law and order in the state,” the group concluded.
