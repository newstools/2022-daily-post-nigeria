A Chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in Kubau Local Government Area of Kaduna State, Dr. Musa Ali pepper, on Thursday, said the federal government must be held responsible if anything happens to the remaining 51 Kaduna-Abuja Kidnapped victims. Bandits had in March 2022, kidnapped 63 Kaduna-Abuja train passengers after killing eight and wounding 16. The criminals later, on different occasions released some of the abductees. However, following the negotiations between the federal government and terrorists, 11 other victims were released recently, leaving 51 others in captivity The bandits had recently raised alarm over the safety of the victims, claiming some had been bitten by snakes and other reptiles. They asked the federal government to fulfil all agreements to ensure the release of the victims. But Dr. Ali Pepper said it appears the federal government has no interest in the suffering of Nigerians and wondered how human beings can remain in the forest for 90 days, yet they keep mum. He said the federal government must do the needful before it is too late or it will be held responsible if anything happens to the victims
