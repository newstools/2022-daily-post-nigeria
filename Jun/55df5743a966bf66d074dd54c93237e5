President Muhammadu Buhari has described the gas explosion, which occurred on Friday at a Kano factory as “extremely horrific”. The Nigerian leader said he was distressed by the tragic accident, the second in the city in one month. At least 200 residents of Sharada Quarters in Kano were hospitalized after inhaling chemicals from a cylinder dismantled by metal scrappers. Buhari, in a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, expressed shock and pain about the incident. “Our brave emergency response agencies and medical workers are trying their best to save lives,” he said. The President assured that the Federal Government was in constant touch with field workers and health facilities. He commended the response of Kano government and the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development. Buhari also hailed hospitals, National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), State Emergency Management Agencies (SEMA) and Nigerian Red Cross for supporting the victims. The statement further wished the hundreds of people that got injured a quick recovery.
