Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has called on members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Rivers State to continue to support the party. The call is coming one week after he was defeated at the PDP presidential primaries by former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar. The governor was speaking in Port Harcourt through his deputy Ipalibo Harry-Banigo who represented him at the thanksgiving service of the PDP in Rivers State on Sunday for successful primaries. He said the members must continue to support the party to enable it win the upcoming general elections, assuring that the PDP is ready to rescue Nigeria. Ipalibo said “His Excellency has asked me to say that we should continue to support our great party. “We should continue to stay true to his vision to ensure that we come out successful in all our elections, the general elections coming up in 2023. “We can be sure that we are focused and we are ready as a party to rescue Nigeria from this terrible current government that has brought so much hardship in the country.”
