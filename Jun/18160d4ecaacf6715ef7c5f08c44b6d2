Shehu Sani, a former Kaduna Central Senator has reacted to the decision asking Catholic faithful to stay away from the Adoration Ministry led by Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka. The Catholic Bishop of Enugu Diocese, Bishop Calistus Onaga had imposed a ban on Mbaka’s Adoration Ministry. DAILY POST reports that this is coming on the heels of Mbaka’s outburst against the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi. In a letter he personally signed and addressed to ‘All the Clergy, Religious and Lay Faithful in the Catholic Diocese of Enugu’, Onaga said they were all banned from having anything to do with the Adoration Ministry. Reacting, Sani likened Mbaka’s situation to that of the removal of Sheikh Khalid as Imam of Apo Juma’at mosque. He noted that like Khalid Mbaka was removed due to their views. In a tweet, the former lawmaker wrote: “Asking Catholics not to attend the Church of Father Mbaka because of his political views is the same as removing Sheikh Khalid as Imam of Apo Juma’at mosque because of his views. We are different only when we tolerate views other than ours.”
