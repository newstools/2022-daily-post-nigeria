Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, on Friday described as ‘rubbish’ reports that he was considering stepping down his presidential ambition for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. Reports had emerged that five All Progressives Congress (APC) governors on Thursday night met to discuss that some of the presidential aspirants in South West should step down for Osinbajo. Fayemi was reported to have been pressured to quit the race and align with the vice president. But reacting, Fayemi, who dismissed the report, maintained that he is favourably positioned and has the backing of real stakeholders of the party ahead of the presidential primary election to clinch the APC ticket. A statement issued and signed by Fayemi’s Head of Media and spokesman Femi Ige, said: “No meeting took place between us and any aspirant about stepping down. “We are undoubtedly among the leading aspirants for the position and one to watch in the race. Our candidate has deep trust and respect among political leaders in the party and also from fellow Governors who form a critical mass in the decision-making process.” Ige urged Fayemi’s supporters to remain calm, focused, and keep the faith, adding that no amount of late-night demarketing will work against the Governor.
