Real Madrid goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois, has welcomed his former Chelsea teammate Antonio Rudiger to the Los Blancos. Real Madrid announced on Thursday that Rudiger had completed his move to the Santiago Bernabeu on a four-year deal from Chelsea. Rudiger joins the new European champions on a free transfer, having rejected Chelsea’s attempts to extend his contract. Reacting, Courtois, who spent seven years at Chelsea before joining Real Madrid in 2018, was quick to message Rudiger after his move to Spain was confirmed. He tweeted: “Welcome bro @ToniRuediger.” Meanwhile, Chelsea described Rudiger as ‘one of the most passionate characters to represent the club in recent memory’ as they paid tribute to the successful defender.
