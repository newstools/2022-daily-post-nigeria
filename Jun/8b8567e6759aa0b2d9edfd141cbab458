The Leader Of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, on Monday, warned the Governor of Delta State, Ifeanyi Okowa against his anointed candidate, Sheriff Oborevwor, who emerged as the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, flag bearer for the 2023 gubernatorial election in the state. Primate Ayodele said Sheriff’s emergence as PDP’s candidate is a huge risk that would push the party to lose the state if care is not taken. In a statement signed by his media aide, Osho Oluwatosin, the man of God noted that the election, which will majorly be between APC and PDP will be “rigged for rigging, money for money but at the end of the day, I don’t see Sheriff coming out in flying colours” due to crisis he will face that will limit the chances of his victory. Primate Ayodele warned the PDP and Governor Okowa to make adjustments because his candidacy is a dangerous risk. He said: ‘’On Delta State gubernatorial election, it will be rigging for rigging, money for money in the governorship elections of the state but at the end of the day, I don’t see PDP candidate, Sheriff Oborevwor coming out in flying colours if the APC strategizes well. ‘’I am warning governor Okowa to immediately swing into action because Sheriff will have issues, the PDP is risking Danger with the Sheriff, I’m not his enemy but that’s what God Said.’’ In the same vein, Primate Ayodele spoke on the candidate of Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State for the next governorship election, Francis Nwifuru. He noted that without rigging, the candidate will not win the election. ‘’Governor Umahi’s candidate for Ebonyi gubernatorial election, Francis Nwifuru will not fly, without rigging he will not win the gubernatorial election’’, he added.
