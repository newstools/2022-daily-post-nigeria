Three men have been arrested Wednesday by the police while on their way to carry out a robbery operation in Ogun State. The trio, identified by the police as members of a robbery syndicate, were nabbed at Orita area of Ilaro, Yewa South Local Government Area of the State. Ogun State police command spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, identified the suspects as 27-year old Ibiyemi Wasiri (a.k.a fellow) and 20-year-old Alabi Ojugbele and 18-year-old Obe Lekan. Oyeyemi said they were arrested during a joint routine patrol carried out by the police of Ilaro area command and Ilaro divisional headquarters. The suspects, sighted on a Bajaj motorcycle with defaced number plate, were said to have jumped off the bike the moment they saw the policemen. As they ran towards different directions, they were chased and arrested by the cops. It was gathered that one locally made pistol, four live cartridges and assorted criminal charms were recovered from the suspects. “On interrogation, Ibiyemi Wasiri had informed the police that he was an ex -convict, and that he still has a pending case of unlawful possession of firearms in a magistrate court. The suspects all confessed that they were going for a robbery operation before they were arrested by the policemen. “Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, has ordered the immediate transfer of the suspects to the state criminal investigation and intelligence department for discreet investigation.”
