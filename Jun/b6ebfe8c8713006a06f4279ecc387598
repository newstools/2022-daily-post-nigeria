Super Eagles coach, Jose Peseiro, has revealed that his team needs more time and must work after beating Sierra Leone 2-1 in Thursday’s 2023 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, qualifier clash at the MKO Abiola Stadium. Peseiro watched as Nigeria defeated Sierra Leone 2-1 in the first fixture of their AFCON qualifying series on Thursday evening. The Super Eagles returned to the MKO Abiola Stadium in Abuja for the first time since the disastrous 1-1 draw with the Black Stars of Ghana in March, which saw the three-time African champions miss out on the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Jonathan Morsay opened the scoring for Sierra Leone, before Nigeria replied with goals from Alex Iwobi and Victor Osimhen. It is the first win for Peseiro, who lost in two friendly matches for Mexico and Ecuador. Speaking during his post-match press conference, Peseiro said, “We created a lot of scoring chances, we could have won with a bigger margin, but the team needs more time and we must work.” He added, “We are better than Sierra Leone in this game, we deserve to win. We changed the setup in the second half, I think it was only the last 10 minutes our opponent had some good moments.” Nigeria will now face Sao Tome and Principe in their next AFCON qualifier on Monday.
