The 2023 Governorship Candidate of the Action Alliance (AA) in Abia State, Onyekwere Akym Uche, has applauded the Independent National Electoral Commission, on its decision to extend the ongoing voter registration and Revalidation exercise ahead of the general election in 2023. This comes on the heels of the call by socio-political groups, members of the national assembly, and the recent court order restraining the nation’s electoral commission from ending the voter’s registration on June 30th. DAILY POST recalls that the Independent National Electoral Commission had earlier fixed June 30, 2022, as the deadline for the ongoing voter registration exercise across the nation. However, Mr. Onyekwere Akym Uche, while reacting in a statement issued to journalists on Friday, maintained that the extension would halt voter apathy that may be experienced during the upcoming general election in 2023 in Abia and the entire country. He tasked the INEC to ensure adequate logistics to enable those who are yet to register or revalidate do so, as it is their civil right and obligation as stipulated in the Constitution of the land. He urged the electoral umpire to resist any pressure from any quarter to manipulate the ongoing process in favour of any particular candidate or senatorial zone in order not to subvert the collective will of the people. While harping on logistics, Mr Akym Uche also urged the INEC to ensure the deployment of additional machines and ad-hoc staff to ensure eligible citizens are captured to ensure they exercise their franchise and enthrone the needed leadership at all levels of Abia State. The Isiukwato-born politician said, “let me use the medium to restate that Permanent Voter Cards (PVC) remain the only weapon vested on the citizenry to effect leadership change, and elect people with needed competence, capacity and expertise to bring the genuine democratic dividends to the doorsteps of the Abia people”.
