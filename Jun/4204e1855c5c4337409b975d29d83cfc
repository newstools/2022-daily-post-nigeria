A bus conveying a press crew covering Lagos State Government and attached to the convoy of Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, was attacked on Sunday. DAILY POST gathered that the incident occurred at the Adeniji end of Isale Eko after the former Lagos State Governor visited the Oba of Lagos on his return to his home state after emerging as a presidential candidate in the 2023 general elections. The hoodlums threw stones and other dangerous weapons at the bus as Tinubu’s convoy drove from the palace. According to a video sighted by DAILY POST, some of the hoodlums were wielding swords and cutlasses smashing side glasses and front windshields of the vehicle.
