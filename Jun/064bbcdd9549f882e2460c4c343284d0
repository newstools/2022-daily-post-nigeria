Social commentator and former senator, Shehu Sani on Friday, slammed President Muhammadu Buhari for alleged non-performance. He said for seven years, Buhari found it difficult to replace or reshuffle his political appointees Shehu Sani on Friday wrote on his verified Facebook page,
“The President boringly maintained ministers for seven years. He found it difficult to replace or reshuffle his appointees. “He extended the tenure of non-performing service chiefs and public officers who completed their terms.” Sani said Buhari inherited, kept and reappointed a CBN Governor. He couldn’t appoint Board members for many federal parastatals for seven years. He was indecisive and incoherent in choosing a successor and firmly standing by him.” “The nation, the government and now the future slipped off his hands before his very eyes.” Shehu Sani wrote
