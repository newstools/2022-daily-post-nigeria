Chelsea have entered the race to snatch Leeds United winger, Raphinha from Arsenal and Tottenham. Arsenal are in talk with Leeds to sign the Brazilian star, who was a key man last season, finishing the campaign with 11 goals in the Premier League. The Brazil international wants to leave Elland Road this summer and has chosen Barcelona as a preferred destination despite interests from Arsenal and Tottenham. But Barcelona are reluctant to make a move due to the financial power to match Leeds’ valuation. The Gunners are said to have submitted an offer for Raphinha, but the bid has been rejected by Leeds as it did not get near their £50m asking price. Mail Online now reports that Thomas Tuchel’s Blues have joined the race to sign the Brazilian winger and are ‘serious’ about submitting an offer to Leeds. Tottenham have also made an approach for Raphinha.
