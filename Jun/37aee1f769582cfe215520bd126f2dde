Leeds United have stepped up their interest in Torino defender, Ola Aina according to reports in Italy. Aina is expected to leave Serie A club, Torino this summer with a number of other Premier League clubs also interested in bringing him back to England. The versatile defender has failed to reclaim his place in the Torino team since returning from the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in February. According to the Italian news outlet, Gazzetta Dello Sport, Leeds United have signalled their intentions by holding talks with Aina’s representatives in the last few hours. Torino is also open to the idea of selling the Nigerian international this summer. The 25-year-old, who made 23 league appearances for Torino last season has a year left on his contract. He is valued around £4m by Torino.
