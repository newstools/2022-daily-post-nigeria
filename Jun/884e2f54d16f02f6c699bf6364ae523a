Liverpool have turned down an opening £21million plus £4m in add-ons bid from Bayern Munich to sign Sadio Mane. Mane has been heavily linked with a departure from Anfield this summer. With just one year left on his current contract, Bayern have been tipped as the Senegalese’s next destination. According to The Times, Liverpool have rejected an opening £21million bid from the Bundesliga champions for the forward. The offer is said to have been received last week and it included a further £4m in add-ons providing Bayern win the Champions League in the future. Liverpool didn’t entertain the offer as they believe Mane, who has won every trophy possible with the Reds, is worth more but they haven’t set a price on the player.
