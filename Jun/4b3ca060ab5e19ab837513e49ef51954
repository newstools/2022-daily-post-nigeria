Former Swansea City star, Dean Saunders, has warned Darwin Nunez that the Premier League would present him with a different ball game following the striker’s switch to Liverpool. Sounders described Nunez as the ‘perfect’ signing for Liverpool but expressed his concern over the signing. Saunders, who also played for Benfica, told talkSPORT, “This lad looks big, strong, quick, and he scores goals – perfect!” However, he pointed out that having played in the Portuguese league, “it is different to playing in the Premier League.” “How? Being honest, it’s easier. They set the fixture list in a certain way so that every team gets a tough game, a mid-table game and then two easy games, otherwise the season is over by Christmas. “So they set the fixtures list up so that at the end of the season all the teams that are in with a shout of winning the league – Benfica, Sporting Lisbon, Porto – have fixtures that are equal. “You don’t get any easy goals in the Premier League, but you probably could in that league.”
