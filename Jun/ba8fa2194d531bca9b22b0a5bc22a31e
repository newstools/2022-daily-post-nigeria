Tottenham Hotspur striker, Harry Kane, has said the arrival of Erling Haaland and Darwin Nunez in the Premier League, will push him to become a better player next season. Haaland’s move to City from Borussia Dortmund was officially confirmed on Monday. Benfica also confirmed Liverpool have agreed a deal to sign Nunez from Benfica, the Portuguese club have announced. Kane was keen to join City last summer, but Spurs chairman Daniel Levy turned down all interest from the champions. When asked if Haaland and Nunez arriving in England would make it harder to lead the goalscoring charts, Kane told reporters: “The battle for the Golden Boot is always tough. The Premier League has produced some top strikers from around the world for a number of years now. “You expect the top strikers to want to play in the Premier League and with those two new signings, that is going to be the case. It helps. It helps me as a player to have good competition, it drives me to improve and get better. So for sure, I look forward to the challenge. “I try and focus on myself to begin with. Going into any season, I have things I want to achieve and goals I want to reach. I try not to focus too much on other players in that aspect.”
