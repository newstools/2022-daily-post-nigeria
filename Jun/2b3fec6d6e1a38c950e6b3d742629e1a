Traditional ruler of the community, Benneth Emeka, disclosed this while addressing a group, All Nations Arise and Manifest Initiative (ANAM), at the weekend in his palace. He said the community does not tolerate such act, and that the suspect, who is a member of his royal cabinet, had been suspended. The monarch said, “The man in question is a member of my cabinet, he is my financial secretary and immediately the matter was reported, we suspended him and he can never come back to the cabinet again. “The matter has been taken to court and that shows that the community does not condone such crime. We have also given the girl scholarship to show our concern and protect her future. It could have been anybody’s child. “I’m advising parents, especially mothers to be cautious and take responsibility for the safety and security of their children.” The Anambra State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Tochukwu Ikenga, confirmed that the suspect had been arrested and charged to court.
