Founder and President, Love for All Nations Ministery, Yinka Yusuf has in his new prophecies, expressed optimism that there would be some drastic changes in the forthcoming 2023 general elections. The clergy listed five changes that would occur during the election, saying Nigerians are more sophisticated in their reasoning and will give a different approach to the exercise. He claimed the hunger, tears, and the spilt blood of the people are crying for a change in the political structure of the country. In the prophecy published on his office Facebook page, the man of God claimed that both the All Progressives Congress, APC and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP would experience the wrath of the voters, stressing that the true voice of the people of Nigeria will be heard. He said, “The political architecture of Nigeria is about to change completely and the following things are going to happen to Nigerians. ”There will be mass defection of party loyalists to the advantage of smaller parties so the choices of the people will increase when it comes to political parties to choose from and when this happens, many more people especially the youths will become more interested in the politics of this great nation. ”Money politics will be totally disgraced, killed and buried in the forthcoming election. Many politicians will spend their billions and still lose the elections. ”There will be so much political awareness and many people will vote for individuals and not political parties. ”People will become conscience-driven and not the usual amala politics or stomach infrastructure as it is popularly known in Nigeria. ”Nigerians are tired and angry about all the lies, deception and outright manipulative nonsense we call democracy; politicians are going to be so surprised because the citizens of this country will no longer allow themselves to be taken for another ride”.
