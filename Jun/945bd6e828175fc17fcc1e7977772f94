The Deputy National chairman (North West), of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Alhaji Salihu Mohammad Lukman has noted that the issues of religion and ethnicity should be de-emphasized by political actors in the choice of a running mate to Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the APC presidential candidate. Ahead of the 2023 general elections, controversy is raging over the issue of a Muslim-Muslim ticket with the Christian bodies warning against such a combination. In a statement on Saturday titled, “Issues for APC 2023 presidential campaign”, Lukman, who is a member of the APC National Working Committee (NWC) and former Director-General of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), believed that the main issue should be how to move the country forward. He believed that challenges of insecurity were being used by opposition parties, especially the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), to allege that the APC had failed, advising that APC leaders must acknowledge the fact that the 2023 elections present another golden opportunity for the party to reinvent itself, looking at the landmark initiatives of the President Buhari government in the last seven years. In his opinion, “The 2023 presidential campaigns must not reduce important debates of moving Nigeria forward to sentimental considerations of ethnicity and religion.” He stated that if the truth is to be told, both Islam and Christianity, as well as all the ethnic factors, have been used in equal measure to hold Nigeria to a standstill.
