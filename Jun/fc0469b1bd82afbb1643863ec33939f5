Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has said he will support Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in the 2023 elections if God directs him. Ortom told Arise Tv that he is fasting and praying for divine guidance before deciding to support Atiku Abubakar. He further stated that Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State stood for the party and made sure that things worked. Ortom said some of the party chieftain’s believed he was the party’s best choice for the vice-presidential candidate and he expects Atiku to reach out to Wike so that together they can work as a party. ”All of us have our weapon; Wike can be ‘something something’ but when it comes to mobilisation, impact, value addition and reaching out to make sure that the party works the man is an instrument. He’s somebody who stood for the party and made sure that things worked. Some of us believed in him, but unfortunately, it was somebody else. But the party is supreme. “However, some of us have resorted to prayers. I have been in hibernation. We’ve resorted to prayer: ‘Lord God, where do we go from here.’ I believe as a Christian that power belongs to God. The Bible says a man can receive nothing except it is given to him from above. “I am praying. I have gone into hibernation. I am fasting and praying. So in the end, if God directs me that I should support Atiku, why should I not do it? After all, he’s my party member. But I am waiting for him to do more. ” I expect him to reach out to Wike, who came second in the presidential primary. The man he denied the popular view of the PDP members — 14 out of 17 — who said Wike should be the vice-presidential candidate. I expect more explanation. I expect him to talk to Wike — whom we are supporting — first. I expect him to reach out to some of us so that together we can work as a party,” he said.
