A governorship aspirant under the All Progressives Congress in Rivers State, Bernard Mikko, has filed a lawsuit against the governorship candidate of the party, Patrick Tonye-Cole, the APC and Independent National Electoral Commission, challenging the just-concluded party’s primaries in the state. Mikko in an originating summon brought before a Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt is asking the court to determine whether in regulations by INEC, in conduct of party primaries, the APC is mandated to conduct its primaries in face of alleged illegalities pertaining the conduct of APC primaries. Mikko is also seeking the court to determine whether Tonye-Cole is qualified to contest for the governorship position despite the alleged report of fraud contained in a white paper released by Justice George Omeriji led panel of inquiry set up by governor Nyesom Wike. He, therefore, asked the court for an order nullifying and setting aside the primaries of APC in Rivers State and to mandate INEC to conduct “democratic fresh primaries” for the party. In the court process, no date has been fixed for the hearing at the Federal High Court.
