Bayern Munich will pay Liverpool a €32m guaranteed fee for forward, Sadio Mane. Mane will sign a three-year deal with Bayern that will see him remain at the Bundesliga champions until 2025. This was disclosed by football transfer expert, Fabrizio Romano. Recall that the Senegalese international has been heavily linked with a move away from Liverpool to join Bayern this summer. “Bayern will pay €32m guaranteed fee for Sadio Mané. Contract already set to be signed, valid until June 2025. Liverpool wanted to sign Nunez in order to approve Sadio’s departure. “Liverpool will also receive add-ons, for a maximum of potential €40m total fee package,” Romano wrote on Twitter on Friday.
