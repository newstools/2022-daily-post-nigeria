A prominent Kaduna based Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, has suggested that Fulani herders and other aggrieved groups in the country be treated like Niger Delta militants by the federal government. Speaking at a Pastoralist and Fulbe Security Conference with the theme, “Exploring the contemporary security challenges facing pastoralists and Fulbe in Nigeria” held in Abuja on Wednesday, Gumi said the government should focus more attention on Fulani herders, claiming they are aggrieved. At the event jointly organised by the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) and Northern Consensus Movement (NCM), Sheikh Gumi said, “What I expect from the government is nothing less than what it did when the Niger Delta youths were vandalising the economy.” He said the Fulani herders are also disturbing Nigerian agriculture which is the backbone of the national economy. The Islamic cleric said he thinks the government needs to be more proactive, stressing that the Fulani herders need attention as the least they need is the ministry of nomadic affairs that will look into their affairs. He explained that crimes perpetuated against pastoralists have no traction in the media, saying that their members have been the highest victims of criminality. He said MACBAN chairmen in Kogi, Niger and Nasarawa States and five other local government chairmen, including that of the Gwagwalada area council, were all recently abducted and killed. Sheikh Ahmad Gumi opined that it buttresses the fact that the Fulanis are not spared from the atrocities of the kidnappings and banditry in their communities.
