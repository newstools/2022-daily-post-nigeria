Zinedine Zidane is now the favourite to replace Mauricio Pochettino as Paris Saint-Germain manager. Goal reports there has been a breakthrough in negotiations between the former Real Madrid boss and PSG. Despite winning the Ligue 1 title this season, Mauricio Pochettino will be sacked at the Parc des Princes, following his shambolic showing in the UEFA Champions League. Zidane has long been linked with the role but is now closer to the position amid a reportedly eye-watering offer. The Frenchman has been out of club management since his second departure from Santiago Bernabeu in 2021. During his first spell in charge of Los Blancos between 2016 and 2018, Zidane won LaLiga in his first season and a remarkable hat-trick of Champions League finals. It is his European pedigree that appeals to PSG more than anything else.
