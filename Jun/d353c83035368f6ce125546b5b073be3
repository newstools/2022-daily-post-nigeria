The Ohanaeze Ndigbo, the Igbo apex socio-political organization has threatened to punish the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP for ignoring the Southeast in picking the running mate of its presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. DAILY POST earlier reported that Atiku on Thursday at the PDP headquarters in Abuja, announced the Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa as his running mate. Some Igbos who believe that the region had sacrificed enough to deserve at least a VP slot from the party, are currently expressing anger over the development. Reacting to Atiku’s choice, Ohanaeze, in a statement issued by its Secretary-General, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, said although the region is yet to decide on which party to support for the 2023 presidential election, it would not be PDP. Ohanaeze said, “we will teach PDP the language they need to understand in the 2023 polls”. “No Igbo political decisions have been made so far on the 2023 election but at the appropriate time, Ndigbo will decide the political direction to go but not the PDP, for shunning the southeast, Atiku will face the consequences of his actions”.
