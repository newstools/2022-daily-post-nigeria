Legal practitioners in Bayelsa State have expressed concern over the security of judges in the various courts in the country, urging the Federal Government to increase security around the courts. They warned that the federal government needs to take the security of judges very seriously. Mr. Marcel Oru, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria(SAN), while speaking during a Seminar organized by the National Association of Seadogs(NAS) in Yenagoa with the theme, Courts Invasion; a threat to the Dispensation of Justice”, said it is sad that while politicians move about with a retenue of well-armed policemen to guard them, judges who are saddled with the audious task of trying hardened criminals are given unarmed police orderly thereby making the court vulnerable to attacks by thugs. Earlier, the Chairman of the association in Bayeslsa, Amaebi Clarkson Esq, described the judiciary as the last hope of the common man whose sanctity ought to be protected by all and sundry. Also speaking, a former chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association, Mr Collins Boleigha, described the latest invasion of the court as barbaric and called on the relevant security agencies to prosecute the culprits. On his part, Mr. Stanley Damabide, also a one time chairman of the group in Yenagoa while condemning the invasion of the courts by thugs, cautioned that members of the bench should also live above board.
