Festus Keyamo, Nigeria’s Minister of State for Labour and Employment, has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC to extend the time frame for voters registration. Keyamo who made this known on his Twitter page on Friday said the new voters would be divided between the ruling party, the main opposition and the others. “INEC should extend the time frame for voters’ registration. Those who spin the tale to look like the mass registration is a 100 % revolt against the ruling party are living in la-la land. “The new voters would be divided between the ruling party, the main opposition and the others,” he said Recall that INEC had on Wednesday told the House of Reps that it may deploy additional machines and ad hoc staff following a request by the House of Representatives to extend the deadline for voters registration Rep Aisha Duku, Chairman of the House Committee on INEC, had said the electoral umpire agreed to extend voters registration. She added that INEC told the committee that the registration days would now include weekends with additional hands to ensure a smooth exercise.
