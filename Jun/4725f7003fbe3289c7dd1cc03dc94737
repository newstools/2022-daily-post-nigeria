I’m not feeling too good at the moment. “After my last performance, I was diagnosed with Reflux laryngitis and I have to take some time off to protect what’s left of my voice. “On the doctor’s orders, I have to postpone the two shows this week- the Birmingham show on the 15th June and the first London show on July 17th.” She apologized to fans, adding that new dates for both shows will be announced soon. “All tickets are still valid! Again I am so sorry. I am so sorry for this inconvenience but I promise to be back better than ever by the grace of God. Then I’ll give you the best show. “Appreciate you all for understanding. You mean the world to me,” Tems wrote.
