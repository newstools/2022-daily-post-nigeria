Joe Aribo has expressed his gratitude for getting through a remarkable campaign for both club and country. Aribo was one of the top performers for Scottish Premiership club, Rangers last season. The 25-year-old featured in three different positions for the Gers during the campaign. The Nigerian international played 70 matches last season, becoming the only player in Europe’s top divisions to reach the mark in a single season. Giovanni van Bronckhorst’s side lost the Scottish Premiership title to rivals Celtic and also made it to the final of the UEFA Europa League where they lost 5-4 on penalties to Bundesliga club, Eintracht Frankfurt. The Ibrox club, however, won the Scottish Cup, edging out Hearts 2-0 in the final. On the international scene, Aribo was part of the Nigeria squad that took part at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon and the qualifying matches for the AFCON 2023. “Grateful to have played 70 games this season, I just wanna thank God for getting me through it. A season full of ups and downs but unforgettable memories were created. Can’t wait to get going next season. Thank you to all the fans for your continued support,” Aribo wrote on his Twitter handle. Aribo has been linked with a move away from Rangers, with Premier League clubs, Aston Villa and Crystal Palace among his suitors.
