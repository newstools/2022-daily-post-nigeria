The seized exhibits consist of 1,294.131KG of Cannabis Sativa, 16.2KG of psychotropic substances and 105 litres of codeine. The Commander of Narcotics, Katsina NDLEA Command, Mohammed Bashir Ibrahim disclosed this on Monday at the grand finale of the “United Nations International Day Against Drug Abuse And Illicit Trafficking” held at the premise of the Katsina Local Government Service Commission. Ibrahim further disclosed that its operatives arrested over 500 suspected drug dealers and traffickers in the process. In addition to that, he said the Katsina NDLEA Command also counseled and rehabilitated 388 substance users within the period under review. According to the Katsina NDLEA Boss, “The command has taken the War Against Drug Abuse (WADA) to the grassroot having mobilized traditional rulers to serve as ambassadors in its bid to ensure a drug free society. The schools and public places e.g Motor packs and markets were not left out in our sensitization programmes.” Speaking at the occasion, the Katsina State Governor Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State blamed the abuse of drugs as the major cause of banditry, kidnapping and other related vices in the country. Masari, who was represented by the State Commissioner for Health, Engineer Yakubu Nuhu Danja, said the state government will continue to support the state command of the NDLEA. Danja said plans are underway by the state government to establish a drug rehabilitation center where medical and psychological treatment can be provided for individuals with drug dependency and addiction issues.
