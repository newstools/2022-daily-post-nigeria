Former Nigeria defender, Ifeanyi Udeze, has said the new head coach of the team, Jose Peseiro, is under pressure ahead of their first 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier against Sierra Leone on Thursday. Peseiro has lost the two games he has been in charge of since his appointment in May. The Eagles Super lost to 2-1 Mexico and 1-0 to Ecuador in international friendlies last week. Four home-based players got the chance to make their debut for the Eagles in the friendlies. However, Peseiro has not included any of them in his 27-man squad invited for the clashes against Sierra Leone and Sao Tome and Principe. “I think, for now, he just wants to do with foreign-based players for now, and see, it does not mean he does not have confidence in the home-based players, but I think, for now, he is under pressure, he put himself under pressure because he wants to get his first win, which will be very, very important to him,” Udeze told Complete Sports. “The home-based players should just calm down, I think they will have their own opportunity also to play some games.”
