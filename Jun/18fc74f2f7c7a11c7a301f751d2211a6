The Federal Government has claimed “a lot is happening behind the scenes” as it seeks to resolve the ongoing strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, stated this while responding to State House correspondents after the weekly federal executive council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa. ASUU embarked on strike since February 14 and since then, all the public universities have been shut down. “I wish that the ASUU issue is as simple as many of us think it is. I don’t think it’s that simple. But I want to assure you that a lot is going on behind the scenes. “And I think probably the Minister of Education will be better positioned to give the details. But like any government, if we’re not concerned, we would not set up all the committees which have been working. If we are not concerned, we will not be looking for means to even assuage the feelings of the Union. “We’re worried, we’re concerned, and we’ll continue to work towards finding an early resolution of the problem,” Mohammed said.
