Barcelona winger, Ousmane Dembele, has reportedly said being a regular starter is a prerequisite for him to join Chelsea from the Catalan club. Dembele has just a few days left to go on his current deal with Barcelona and is set to depart Camp Nou on a free transfer. According to Sport, Dembele is seeking reassurances that he will be an undisputed starter at Chelsea before committing his future to the Premier League giants. The France international had played under Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, during their time at Borussia Dortmund. The 25-year-old joined Barcelona from Dortmund in a then club-record deal worth €110m in the summer of 2017. Dembele was tipped to become Neymar’s long-term successor at Camp Nou, but an injury-ravaged spell meant he has not fully lived up to his potential at the LaLiga giants. He has drawn the interest of Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain in the past few days.
