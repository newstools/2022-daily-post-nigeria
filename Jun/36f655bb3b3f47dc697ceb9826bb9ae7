According to him, the November World Cup in Qatar will play a significant role in his thinking. “It’s no secret there are clubs that are interested in me. Yes, it’s flattering. But it’s also flattering to have a club like Leipzig doing everything to keep me,” Nkunku told Telefoot. “Here, we will have to think carefully and make a good decision. The World Cup is coming to life and this is a parameter to be taken into account. “Like I said, you just have to think it through.”
