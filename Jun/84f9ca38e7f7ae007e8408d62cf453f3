The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu has said he is still searching for his running mate ahead of the 2023 presidential election. He disclosed this while speaking at an event held to mark the 60th birthday celebration of the Speaker of the House of Representative, Femi Gbajambiamila in Abuja on Sunday. Tinubu, while commending the unity between the Speaker and his deputy, Idris Wase, said politicians need to learn how the duo have maintained a stable relationship since they started their reign. “You are a very good symbol of unity and honesty. “Thank you for both of you; you have not rocked the boat and we need to learn from both of you how you made the pair work because I’m still searching for my running mate”. Tinubu’s assertion is coming after the APC submitted the name of Kabiru Masari to the Independent National Electoral commission as a running mate to the former Lagos state Governor. However, there have been a massive outcry against a Muslim-Muslim ticket which some major stakeholders believe is the only way the APC can secure a victory in the 2023 Presidential election. Earlier, Tinubu praised Gbajabiamila for the role he played in his emergence as the presidential flag bearer of the APC.
