The Super Eagles moved top of Group A in the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers after a comprehensive 10-0 win against Sao Tome and Principe in Agadir, Morocco on Monday afternoon The Super Eagles pegged back the hosts in the opening minutes and were rewarded when Victor Osimhen scored the opener in the ninth minute. Osimhen nodded home following a superb cross from Moses Simon. The Super Eagles wasted a number of chances afterwards. Jose Peseiro’s side, however, doubled their lead two minutes before the half-hour mark with Simon tapping home after he was set up by Osimhen. The lively Terem Moffi scored Nigeria’s third of the game two minutes before the break dribbling past two defenders before slotting home. The Super Eagles scored six more goals after the break to make the score line more emphatic. Osimhen netted three times, with Moffi, Oghenekaro Etebo Ademola Lookman and substitute Emmanuel Dennis all getting among the goals. The Super Eagles top Group A with six goals from two games. Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau will clash in the other group game later in the day.
