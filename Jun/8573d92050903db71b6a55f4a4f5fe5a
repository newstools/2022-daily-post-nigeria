As the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) deadline for political parties to submit names of 2023 presidential candidates and running mates draw nearer, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has approved the composition of a committee to screen Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, his Delta State counterpart, Ifeanyi Okowa and others as possible vice president nominees. Recall that former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar emerged the party’s 2023 presidential candidate in a keenly contested National Convention last month. However, the INEC last week announced Friday, 17th June 2022, as the deadline for political parties to submit names of presidential candidates and their running mates. Consequently, the PDP as contained in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Hon. Debo Ologunagba, Wednesday, constituted the Vice Presidential Candidate Screening Committee (VPSC). According to the statement, “pursuant to Part VI, Paragraph 14 of the Electoral Guidelines of our great Party, the PDP National Working Committee (NWC) has approved the nomination of the following Party members to serve on the Vice Presidential Candidate Screening Committee for the screening/verifying of the nominated Vice Presidential Candidate of our Party for the 2023 general elections”. PDP appointed High Chief Tom Ikimi as Chairman and made Dr. Akilu Indabawa the Secretary. Other members of the PDP VPSC include: former governor of Kogi State, Capt. Idris I. Wada (rtd), former minister of aviation, Chief Osita Chidoka, Rt. Hon. Binta Bello, Chief Mrs. Alh. Mutiat Adedoja, Rt. Hon. Austin Opara, Prof. Aisha Madawaki, Mrs. Ayotunde George-Ologun, Chief Mrs. Chidiebelu Mofus and Fidelis Tapgun. Mr. Sunday Omobo is the Administrative Secretary. “The screening exercise will hold at the National Working Committee (NWC) Hall, PDP National Secretariat, Wadata Plaza, Abuja on Thursday, June 16, 2022, at 10am,” the party stated.
