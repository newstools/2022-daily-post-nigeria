Nigeria captain, Ahmed Musa, has insisted he never informed anyone he has retired from international football. The Fatih Karagumruk winger claims he was misquoted and the coaches still find him good enough for upcoming matches. “I didn’t tell anyone that I am done with Super Eagles. I said I might consider retiring after the World Cup if Nigeria had qualified. “The new coach has called me to come and play in the AFCON qualifiers and I cannot say no to him because it is a call to serve my country,” Musa told Complete Sports. He added: “AFCON is next year and I am still actively playing in Turkey and if the coaches find me good enough to be at the AFCON in Ivory Coast, I will gladly go and help my country to win it. I will always honor invitations to serve my country and give my best.” Musa is in the Super Eagles camp ahead of the AFCON 2023 games against Sierra Leone and São Tomé and Principé.
