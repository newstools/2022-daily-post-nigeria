Paul Pogba is officially a free agent, but Manchester United must still pay him over £1million in wages. According to the UK Mirror, the Frenchman earned £290,000 at United. During his second spell at Old Trafford, it is calculated that Pogba will have earned a total of £90.5million since 2016. The amount is slightly more than the transfer fee the club shelled out to bring him back from Juventus. This means Pogba was paid a total of £800,000 for each performance he made for United over the course of six seasons. Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain are thought to be the frontrunners for Pogba’s signature this summer.
