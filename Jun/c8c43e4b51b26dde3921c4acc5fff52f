Former England International, Gary Neville has revealed why he did not sing his country’s national anthem during his playing days. The defender said his refusal to sing ‘God Save the Queen’ during the Euro 96, was a protest against the English Football Association, FA. A video of the former Red Devil standing in stony silence while his teammates sang the national anthem resurfaced online recently after football fans argued that Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold does not also sing the anthem. Neville said he does regret not singing the anthem during the tournament but called it a ‘big mistake’ which was due to his ‘stubbornness.’ ‘I didn’t sing it the first time I played for England, partly because I thought “I’m serious about my work and I’m not singing before a game”, he said on Sky Sports, adding “I said ‘I’m not being told by some suits what to do”.’
