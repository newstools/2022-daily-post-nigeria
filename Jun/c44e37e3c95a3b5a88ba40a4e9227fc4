Alex Iwobi is determined to keep doing his best for Everton after earning rave reviews for his excellent displays in the Toffees Premier League run-in last season. The Nigerian international played a key role during the final weeks of the 2021/22 season as Frank Lampard’s side finally maintained top-flight status. Iwobi’s relentless work-ethic endeared him to the fans, most of whom were critical of his performances following his arrival from Arsenal two years ago. The 25-year-old was not only the Everton player that started the Merseysideiders’ final 12 matches of the season, but also played every minute of those games. Iwobi hopes to maintain same level of performance next season. “Evertonians appreciate hard work and the physical side,” Iwobi told evertonfc.com. “If I have that energy, hopefully it influences my teammates. “It is important that I understand the culture of the city, the passion for football and for Everton. “I love playing and like to express myself through football, so when I get the opportunity, I just try my best. “The manager spoke to me after the Leicester home game [a 1-1 draw on 20 April] about having a bit more tactical awareness. “He said, ‘It is nice to have the energy to run and chase and get back, but maybe, sometimes, preserve it, chill out, so you’re not burned out’. “Other than that, he says maintain the work-ethic because it really helps the crowd engage with the team. “The manager knows I have the ability to press and quickly get back into shape.”
