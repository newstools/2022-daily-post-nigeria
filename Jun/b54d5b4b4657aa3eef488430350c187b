Brazil forward, Neymar is close to breaking the country’s legend Pele’s goals record. Neymar on Monday scored the only goal in Brazil’s 1-0 victory over Japan in an international friendly match at the Japan National Stadium. Neymar’s goal against Japan means the Paris Saint-Germain star now has 74 international goals in 119 caps for Brazil. The former Barcelona star is three goals behind Pele, who netted 77 goals for Brazil. Meanwhile, Neymar is well ahead of Brazil legend Ronaldo’s 62. Neymar will hope to lead Brazil to victory when the 2022 FIFA World starts in November in Qatar.
