Member of the defunct music group, Zule Zoo, Mr Michael Tertsea Aboh has been reported dead. According to reports currently making the rounds, the “Kerewawa” dance crooner died on Saturday morning in Makurdi the Benue State capital. Terna Rapsody Hyacinth who is close to the Family, confirmed the development in a post on his official Facebook page. He wrote, “I wish people were eager to help you survive when you were alive suffering, roaming the street of Makurdi than the way they are eager to let the world know of your demise today!! Rest on Legend”. Aboh’s music partner, Hassan Ibrahim, aka Ibro had alleged that Aboh was into drugs and alcohol, saying he was mentally unstable. DAILY POST reports that Aboh has been in Makurdi since life became unbearable for him in Lagos State. In an interview he recently granted, Aboh debunked report that he was mentally unstable. He, however, admitted that he has been going through several challenges since he relocated from Lagos.
