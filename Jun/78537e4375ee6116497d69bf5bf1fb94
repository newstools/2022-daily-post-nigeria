But reacting, his spokesman, Paul Ibe, told Daily Trust that his principal had not chosen Ihedioha or any other person as his running mate. According to him, the former Vice President would announce his running mate when the time is right. “When we decide to speak on the issue of running mate, it will not be a subject of speculation, we will roll it out. It is not going to be something that will be speculated on social media, online platforms or Whatsapp groups. “So from my own stable, I cannot confirm that to be true. These are the times for all manner of speculations. People should endeavour to wait for the official announcement. But this speculation is unknown to me.”
