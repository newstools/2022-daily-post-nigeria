An All Progressives Congress (APC) Chieftain in Oyo State on Friday alleged that members of the state House of Assembly are only active when they are financially induced. Isaac Ajiboye Omodewu, Chairman of the party and a former Commissioner in the state made the allegations in Ibadan while reacting to the recent approval of a N2 billion loan by the state House of Assembly for Governor Seyi Makinde. DAILY POST recalls that members of the Oyo State House of Assembly on Thursday, during an emergency meeting, approved the sum of N2bn loan for the state government. Omodewu claimed the lawmakers are just there to approve anything the governor pushes to their table. In a statement made available to DAILY POST on Friday, Omodewu advised the lawmakers to stop acting as rubber stamps. The APC chairman who frowned at the action of the lawmakers insisted that they are expected to serve as checks and balances for the executive arm of the government. He condemned the state’s rising debt profile under Governor Seyi Makinde-led administration, describing the fresh loan request as an act of wickedness and recklessness on the part of the Governor. He said it was saddening that Oyo State’s economy has been pushed to the point where overdrafts are being taken to pay salaries, adding that billions of naira are wasted monthly on powering streetlights with diesel generators. Omodewu said, “It is regrettable that the PDP-dominated Oyo State house of Assembly is only active when they are financially induced to approve Governor Makinde’s loan requests. We hereby advise the lawmakers to stop acting as rubber stamps. “They are expected to serve as checks and balances for the executive arm of the government, instead of routinely serving the governor’s selfish whims.”
