The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has appealed to fans to steer clear of the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja on Thursday. The Super Eagles will host the Leone Stars of Sierra at the ground in their 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying matchday one clash. The game will be played behind a closed door as a consequence of the one-match ban placed on the country by the world football –governing body, FIFA over the fracas that followed the end of the 2022 FIFA World Cup playoff round against the Black Stars of Ghana in March. Only journalists and important signatories will be allowed into the grounds. “We want to appeal to our very passionate football fans to take heart for this one game. It is only a one-match ban, after which they can again start trooping out to support the Super Eagles. The match against Sierra Leone will be without fans as a consequence of what happened after the match against the Ghanaians,” NFF secretary-general Mohamed Sanusi told thenff.com. “Nonetheless, we want to urge all our football fans, and indeed all Nigerians, to support the team whichever way they can and pray for success against the Sierra Leoneans on Thursday.” The Super Eagles will travel to Marrakech, Morocco for their matchday two encounters against Sao Tome and Principe next week Monday. The Djurtus of Guinea-Bissau is the other team in the group.
