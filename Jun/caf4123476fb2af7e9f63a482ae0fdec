The House of Representatives Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, has congratulated Bola Tinubu. The former Lagos State Governor clinched the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential ticket on Wednesday. In a statement, the lawmaker said he was elated that his political mentor won the APC primary. He described the victory as well-deserved, considering Tinubu’s “years of working for the entrenchment of democracy in Nigeria”. Gbajabiamila said the APC stood a good chance of retaining power in 2023. The Speaker described Tinubu as a dogged fighter who stood his ground to compete the primary in a democratic manner. “I congratulate my mentor for this victory. This is a victory for democracy and Nigerians as a whole. “He stood his ground that the APC must organise a free, fair and transparent presidential primary if it wanted to remain the party to beat.” Gbajabiamila hailed the APC leader for his doggedness, determination, resilience and tenacity. “This is a victory for APC, a victory for its members and indeed a victory for Nigeria and its democracy,” he added.
