Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, has claimed that the Presidential Candidate of the party, Atiku Abubakar, insulted the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike. In an interview on Arise TV, Ortom said it was an insult for Atiku to send emissaries to Wike, who was runner-up in the party’s presidential primaries. The governor criticized Atiku for not reaching out to Wike personally. Ortom said: “It’s an insult for Atiku Abubakar to send people to a powerful mobiliser like Wike. “Atiku offended Wike. It is an insult for Atiku to send people to call Wike. “Atiku and the leadership of the party at all levels must visit him, Wike is a strong pillar in PDP.” “Why can’t Atiku visit Wike personally?”
