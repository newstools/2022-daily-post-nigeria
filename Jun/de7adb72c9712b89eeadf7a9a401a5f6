Family of the winner of the annulled June 12 1993 presidential election, MKO Abiola, has called on the Federal Government to implement the manifesto of the late politician. This, the family believes, would give succour to the less-privileged in the nation. The Head of the Abiola Family, Murtala Abiola, said this while addressing newsmen during the annual prayer session for the late business mogul at their family compound in Gbagura, Abeokuta, capital of Ogun State. According to Murtala, Abiola’s “Farewell to Poverty” manifesto proffered solutions about how to provide succour to the students, the unemployed and the aged. He explained that Abiola’s manifesto had planned allowances for students and the unemployed, saying all were geared towards eliminating poverty in the country. He stressed that Nigeria’s money belongs to all Nigerians, regardless of race or religion, “everyone must benefit from it.” The family added that the United States of America has a way of taking care of the aged, begging the Nigerian government to imbibe such act. “All these programmes should be made accessible in Nigeria. We all travel abroad and see what is obtainable there,” he said. He regretted that Nigeria funds are ending up in the pockets of few politicians. “The money will finish, and he, who is keeping the money, will finish,” he stressed. Murtala described Abiola as a special breed, saying it would take a century before Nigeria can produce “another MKO Abiola.” The prayer was attended by the Deputy Governor of Ogun State, Engr Noimot Salako-Oyedele, who disclosed that the state would continue to work in line with the vision of the late MKO Abiola in striving to improve on the welfare of the people.
