Barcelona president, Joan Laporta, has given an update on the club’s hopes of keeping winger Ousmane Dembele and midfielder Gavi. Dembele is free to leave Barcelona this summer after rejecting several offers from the LaLiga giants to extend his stay at Camp Nou. Gavi, on the other hand, is out of contract next year and talks over a new deal for the impressive 17-year-old Spain star have hit an impasse. Asked about Gavi by reporters on Sunday, Laporta said: “We are optimistic. We obviously want Gavi to continue at Barça. “We are close to reaching an agreement. It is more special for us because he [Gavi] comes from our youth ranks. We want Gavi to stay. The player and his agent want it too.” On Dembele, he added, “Ousmane had a renewal offer from us, and we have no news that he has accepted it.”
