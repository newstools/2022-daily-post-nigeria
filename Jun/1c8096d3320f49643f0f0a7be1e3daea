The North-east APC Youth Stakeholders Forum has called on the All Progressives Congress (APC) to zone the vice presidential position to the region. The Chairman of the group, Mr. Haruna Sardauna, made the call while addressing a press conference yesterday in Abuja. The group noted that zoning the position to the North-east would neutralise the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, who is from the region. It said, “Zoning the position of the Vice President to the North East will neutralize the PDP Presidential candidate and mobilize massive support from the region and other zones to ensure victory of Alh. Ahmed Bola Tinubu.” The group pointed out that whoever is picked from the region, whether Muslim or Christian would be supported. It added that the North east region has consistently given block votes to the APC and supported candidates from the other region right from inception. The group insisted that the North east should be considered, considering the sacrifices the region has made for the party.
