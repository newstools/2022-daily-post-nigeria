The Zamfara State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has advised residents to register as the electoral law specifies that only those whose names are on the voters’ list are qualified to vote during elections. According to the state publicity secretary of the party, Comrade Yusuf Idris Gusau, whoever intends to exercise his or her civic rights on election day must register as a voter. “If you love Nigeria, then you’ll call for true democracy in our nation, your voters’ card is a tool for such. Your voters card is your voice and power,” he added. “It’s a weapon to terminate the selfish ambition of some leaders and to safeguard the great aspirations of reputable nation builders. “Your Voters card can protect your Posterity if used wisely and it can bring about a new Nigeria. “Visit the nearest INEC registration center or polling unit around you with a valid means of identification like a birth certificate, a driver’s licence, national passport, or any other document that can prove identity, age, and nationality, and also you can visit inecnigeria.org “After the registration process is complete, INEC will issue you a Temporary Voter’s Card (TVC) as a placeholder for when the permanent one will be ready. “When your PVC is ready, you can use the TVC to claim it at your INEC LGA office after your name has been verified on the distribution list.”
