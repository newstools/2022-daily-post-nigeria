Premier League’s top goal scorer of all time, Alan Shearer, has given his verdict on Liverpool and Manchester City’s two huge signings. Liverpool bought Darwin Nunez from Benfica, while Man City signed Erling Haaland from Borussia Dortmund this summer. And Shearer believes Nunez and Haaland will meet the expectations of their respective clubs once the new season starts, adding that the duo will give defenders nightmares. Expressing his views on the arrival of both players, Shearer said on Sky Sports: “Two huge signings. Two fantastic players. I’m certain both players will score a lot of goals in the Premier League and will make their clubs better. “I have seen bits of them in the Champions League, obviously. It’s great for the Premier League that their clubs are able to attract those kinds of players and I look forward to watching them a lot next season. “They have both (Liverpool and Manchester City) had success last season and when you win things you have got to go out and strengthen. With the turnover of (Sadio) Mane, Liverpool had to bring someone big in to try and replace him, because he is (Mane) been an unbelievable player for them. I look forward to watching the next season.”
