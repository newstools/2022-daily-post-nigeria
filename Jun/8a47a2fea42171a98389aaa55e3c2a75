Former Arsenal striker, Kevin Campbell has told his former club to sign Ajax defender Lisandro Martinez this summer. Campbell said Martinez is a very tenacious player, adding that Arsenal needs him in Mikel Arteta’s squad. According to him, the 24-year-old Argentine could make a huge difference for the Gunners. “We need a player like that. Martinez is a player who can play in multiple positions as well as anybody,” Campbell told Football Insider. “He can probably play four positions to a high level. He’s very tenacious and is a good technician. That makes a huge difference. “We have seen that when Arsenal have injuries, the players who come in haven’t been up to standard. They just have not. It’s nice to see Arsenal going for players like Martinez who could make a difference. The key is, they’ve to sign them. It’s not enough to be interested in them. We need to sign them,” he said.
