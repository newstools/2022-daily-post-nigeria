Aston Villa manager, Steven Gerrard, has picked between Paris Saint-Germain’s Lionel Messi and Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo. Gerrard, a Liverpool legend, insisted that Messi would make his team, while Ronaldo would not because he prefers teamwork to an individual game. According to him, he prefers the Barcelona legend over the Portugal captain, who he feels is more of an individual player than a team player. Messi and Ronaldo have established themselves as the best football players of their generation. Both players have won seven and five Ballon d’ Or awards in the last 15 years. “There are certain players who are on a different level to anyone else out there, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo,” Gerrard was quoted as saying by Give Me Sport. “But Ronaldo doesn’t get in my team. I am more about what you are going to do for the team. What are we going to achieve together? Ronaldo will win you things, but I am more about a team player than an individual player, so I will always go down that road.”
