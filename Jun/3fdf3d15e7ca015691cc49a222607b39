Governor-elect of last Saturday’s Ekiti State governorship election, Biodun Oyebanji, has written off speculations that his party, the All Progressive Congress helped him procure victory through vote-buying. Oyebanji said neither he nor the ruling APC was involved in the alleged votes buying scam during the polls. Oyebanji spoke to State House Correspondents on Monday, after the party’s leadership presented him to President Muhammadu Buhari as the winner of the election and governor-elect of the state. Chairman of the APC, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, led the delegation to the Presidential Villa. Other members of the team that accompanied the governor-elect to the villa, include the Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) and governor of Ekiti, Kayode Fayemi; Chairman of the Progressives Governors’ Forum (PGF) and governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu; governor of Jigawa State, Mohammed Badaru; and the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba Niyi Adebayo, who was also governor of Ekiti State between 1999 to 2003. Responding to the question of alleged votes buying during the election that ushered him in as governor-elect, Oyebanji said his victory was a result of the sterling performance of the APC-led administration in the state, coupled with the fact that he campaigned effectively and presented a reasonable manifesto to the people of the state and neither himself nor the party bought any votes. Corroborating Oyebanji, the National Chairman of the APC, Abdullahi Adamu, said such allegation of vote-buying may be the handwork of the opposition class who are angry for losing out at the poll.
