About one week after the conduct of All Progressives Congress, APC, primary election for Bade/Jakusko Federal Constituency in Yobe State, controversy has trailed the exercise where some aspirants insisted that there was no primary election. Three aspirants namely: Sani Ahmed Kaitafi, Mohammed Manu Girgir and the incumbent member representing the constituency Zakari Ya’u Galadima
contested for the seat. According to the Director-General of Kaitafi Campaign Organisation, Bukar Lala, the APC primaries for Bade/Jakusko Federal constituency never held. “They just produced the result and submitted it to the state party secretariat, but there was no election in the Bade/Jakusko Federal Constituency”, Lala alleged. Similarly, one of the supporters of another contestant, Mohammed Manu Girgir, also claimed that, “No election took place in the constituency”. However, a result sheet of the constituency primary election obtained by DAILY POST, showed that Zakari Ya’u Galadima was the winner of the election. The result sheet also showed that the lawmaker was elected unopposed with 100 votes and was signed by one Hadiza Yola/Jimeta as the Returning Officer for the primary election. The result was also endorsed by INEC official as well as security personnel. “As far as I am concerned, I am the winner of the election. I didn’t manufacture results”, the Galadima claimed.
