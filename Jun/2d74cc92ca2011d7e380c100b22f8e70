Gareth Bale’s agent, Joshua Barnett has rubbished reports that the player will join Spanish side, Getafe. The Wales captain is set to leave Real Madrid this summer as a free agent. Bale was most recently linked to LaLiga side Getafe amid suggestions he may be keen to remain in Madrid, where he has lived for the past nine years. Getafe club president, Angel Torres, seemed to back up those rumours when he said Bale had been offered to the club. However, Barnett has reportedly played down the move to the Spanish side. Football journalist Fabrizio Romano claimed that Barnett laughed off the rumours on Wednesday evening, saying: “I don’t even have the president of Getafe’s number!” This hands Cardiff City a boost in their pursuit of Bale.
