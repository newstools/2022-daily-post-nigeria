Victor Osimhen has claimed LaLiga and Premier League clubs are interested in signing him this summer from Napoli. Osimhen enjoyed an impressive campaign for Napoli, scoring 18 goals and registering six assists in 32 appearances across all competitions for the Partenopei. The 23-year-old has been linked with the likes of Manchester United, Arsenal and Newcastle United. The Nigerian international however revealed that Spanish clubs are also keen on signing him during the summer’s transfer window. “I know there are many people that would like me in Spain or England, but I don’t think it’s the right time to talk about it,”Osimhen was quoted by Calciomercato. “I always go out on the pitch to do my best both with the national team and with my club. “I don’t know my future, I know anything can happen, but now I just want to go on holiday with my family, clear my head and recharge my batteries. Then we’ll take off everything else.”
