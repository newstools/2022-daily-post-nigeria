Apostle Johnson Suleman, Senior Pastor of Omega Fire Ministries, has advised churches in the country to beef up security during service. The cleric gave the advice while reacting to the killing of innocent worshippers at St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State. DAILY POST had reported that many worshippers died and others sustained injuries when gunmen opened fire inside the church. Condemning the incident, Suleman said GOD will not come down to do what churches ought to do. He wrote on Twitter, ”All churches should beef up security Especially mega-churches. GOD will not come down to do what you should do.” ”This is evil and MUST be condemned by all and sundry,” he added.
