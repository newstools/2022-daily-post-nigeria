The Kogi State Police Command has confirmed the abduction of Rev. Fr Christopher Onotu, a Catholic Priest by unknown gunmen. Onotu was kidnapped on Saturday evening by unknown gunmen from his Church in Obangede, Okehi Local Government Area of Kogi State. Reacting to the kidnap on Sunday evening, the Police Public Relations Officer, SP Williams Aya, said the Commissioner of Police, Edward Egbuka has deployed a high power intelligent team to rescue the Priest unhurt. DAILY POST gathered that the gunmen reportedly made their way into the Church’s vicarage at about 9pm, burgled the window through which they entered the priest’s room and whisked him away to an unknown destination. Most of the members of the Church got to find out on Sunday morning when they went for the first mass. A member of the Church, who never wanted his name mentioned because he was not authorized to speak to the press, said, “the hoodlums went away with our priest’s car. “They dropped his two phones but went with the Sim cards.” The kidnap of the cleric in the Central Senatorial district of Kogi State is coming barely one week after a popular politician and Board member of the Hydroelectric Power Producing Areas Development Commission, HYPPADEC, was kidnapped on his way to the mosque in Ogaminana. His whereabouts is still unknown as of the time of filing this report, even though the image maker of the Nigeria Police, SP William Ovye Aya had earlier said the command was collaborating with sister security agencies to track him.
