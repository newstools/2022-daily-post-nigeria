The All Progressives Congress (APC) has said that the achievements of Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi made it easy for the party to win the governorship election in Ekiti state. The National Publicity Secretary of the party, Mr. Felix Morka in a statement issued Sunday, said unsurprisingly, the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) came a distant third position in the just-concluded election, despite its claim to a self-serving and self-assigned rescue mission of Nigeria It noted that the people of Ekiti State and by extension, Nigerians are not, in any way, deceived by the ceaseless propaganda of a desperate party that only seeks a return to power to continue its ruinous escapades. The ruling party said that without a doubt, the well-deserved victory in Ekiti State was an eloquent testimony of the acceptance of the party under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, the sagacity of the National Chairman, Sen. Abdullahi Adamu, and the uncommon commitment of members of the National Working Committee (NWC). It said: “As we savour the joy and euphoria of victory in the just-concluded gubernatorial election in Ekiti State, the All Progressives Congress (APC) wishes to congratulate and profoundly appreciate the wonderful people of Ekiti State for reaffirming their confidence in our party by rallying round the Governor-Elect, Biodun Oyebanji. “It bears mentioning that the towering accomplishments of incumbent Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode John Fayemi, provided a solid predicate for this decisive victory. We thank you for your service to your State and Country.”
