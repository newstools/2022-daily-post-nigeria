Former Chelsea star, Glen Johnson, has said that Everton’s Richarlison would play more than Romelu Lukaku at Chelsea. He believes the Brazilian star would be a ‘sensible’ signing for the Blues but says that Thomas Tuchel’s side should not be paying over the odds for the player. The Brazilian is expected to leave Everton this summer and has attracted interest from Tottenham, Chelsea and Arsenal. Asked if Chelsea should go for the player, Johnson told BettingOdds; “I certainly believe he would suit the way Chelsea play more than Romelu Lukaku. “Whether he’s good enough to be their main man and get 20 goals a season, then I’m not so sure. “I do like him though and I think he’s a good player and it could be a sensible move if the fee is reasonable.”
