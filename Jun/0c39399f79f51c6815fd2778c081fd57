Grasshopper forward, Ana Maria Markovic, who has been dubbed ‘the world’s most beautiful footballer’ as per The Sun, has named Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo as her favourite player. Markovic said Ronaldo is just so disciplined, adding that he has a good mindset. The 22-year-old has cited Ronaldo as her inspiration to shine on the international stage while proclaiming her support for Real Madrid and Croatia midfielder Luka Modric. Speaking to 20min, Markovic said, “[Luka] Modric is definitely a great role model for me. He is a world footballer and represents Croatia. There are many good players among the women, such as [Ramona] Bachmann. “But my absolute favourite player is Cristiano Ronaldo because he is just so disciplined. I think it is super important that you give your all in sport and have a good mindset like him.” Markovic grew up in Switzerland but represents Croatia at the international level, who failed to qualify for this summer’s Women’s European Championships in England.
