President Muhammadu Buhari has adduced reasons the Federal Government reviewed the Democracy Day from May 29 to June 12. Buhari said his government reviewed Democracy Day from May 29 to June 12 to honour the late MKO Abiola. He noted that Abiola and other heroes sacrificed their lives to birth a new Nigeria. The President disclosed this during his nationwide broadcast to mark 2022 Democracy Day on Sunday Buhari said Democracy Day was a time to celebrate the freedom and unity of Nigeria. According to Buhari: “From 1999, we consistently celebrated Democracy Day to mark the end of military rule and the return of power and control into the hands of those freely elected by the people. On this day, Nigerians recommit themselves to ensuring we protect and preserve the ideals of democracy. “In 2018, we moved Democracy Day from 29th of May to the 12th of June. This change was to remind all Nigerians of one free election after which the presumed winner along with Nigerians were denied their rights and their choice. “On June 12th 1993, Nigerians saw the best in our citizens as we all went out to vote peacefully. By June 24th 1993, we also saw the worst of our leadership as the elections were annulled. “We must never forget the sacrifices of the heroes of Nigeria’s democracy during 1993.” Buhari said the patriotism and peaceful struggle of Abiola and other heroes of the past should guide Nigerians in picking leaders and holding them accountable in 2023. Previously, Democracy Day was celebrated on May 29 since 1999 when former President Olusegun Obasanjo took over power from the military. That changed in 2018, when the current administration reviewed the date to June 12.
