Australia became the 31st country to qualify for the 2022 World Cup, thanks to a 5-4 penalty shootout win over Peru on Monday. It was the single game playoff between the fifth-placed finishers in Asian and South American qualifying matches. The match ended 0-0, before substitute goalkeeper, Andrew Redmayne saved the last penalty from Alex Valera. Australia has now qualified for a fifth successive World Cup and a sixth in total. They will play in Group D alongside holders France, Denmark and Tunisia. On Tuesday, the last spot at Qatar 2022 will be decided when Costa Rica and New Zealand clash in their inter-continental playoff, also at the Ahmad bin Ali Stadium.
