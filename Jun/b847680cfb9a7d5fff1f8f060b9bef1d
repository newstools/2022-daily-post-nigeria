Barcelona defender, Gerard Pique and Colombian pop star, Shakira have split. This was confirmed in a terse statement on Saturday. The pair, whose relationship began in 2010, have two sons together, Milan and Sasha. A brief statement, released by Shakira’s communication agency, confirmed: “We regret to confirm that we are parting ways. “For the well-being of our children, who are our highest priority, we ask that you respect their privacy.
