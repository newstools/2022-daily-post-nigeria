Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has described the gruesome killing of parishioners at the St. Francis Catholic Church in Owo Local Government Area of Ondo State, on Sunday as an unspeakable evil. The vice president said the perpetrators would be fished out and made to face the full wrath of the law. Osinbajo’s spokesman, Laolu Akande, in a statement on Monday in Abuja, said the vice president visited Owo town and the Catholic Church to commiserate with the clergy, community and people of Ondo over the incident. The vice president also visited those who were injured at St. Louis Catholic Hospital in the town. He said the incident was a terrible tragedy and unspeakable evil by depraved minds and terrorists. The statement read in part, “The president has already ordered a full-scale investigation of this crime. ”Without any doubt, those who perpetrated this will be fished out and they will pay for the consequences of this crime.” The vice president was received in Akure by the Ondo State Dep. Gov. Lucky Aiyedatiwa and was later joined by Gov. Rotimi Akeredolu in Owo. Osinbajo said, “This barbaric act is one that has to be condemned by all. “But more importantly, we must find the perpetrators and they must be punished, and we must set an example.”
