Gunmen suspected to be bandits have again unleashed a terror attack at about 11:30 pm on Sunday in Furfuri village, Bungudu Local Government Area of Zamfara State, which is about 7km away from the state capital, Gusau. DAILY POST gathered that three wives of the former Accountant General of the state, Alh. Abubakar Bello Furfuri, were kidnapped in the operation. Eyewitnesses from the village said they abducted over 20 people from the village. “In one house, they kidnapped over 10 women and they moved away with them,” the source added. The villagers also said that military operatives had been swiftly deployed to the axis. “We saw two Hilux vans loaded with military personnel in the village but before they arrived the bandits had left,” the source said. However, there was no official report from the government or the state police command at the time of filing this report. Efforts to reach the state police spokesman, SP Mohammed Shehu, for confirmation, proved abortive as he did not pick calls frоm newsmen.
