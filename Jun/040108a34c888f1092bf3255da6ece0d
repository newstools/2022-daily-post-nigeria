National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) Osun State axis has issued a 12-day ultimatum to the state to fix the campuses roads. The student body threatened to shut down the state “by hitting the street with thousands of students right proponents” if the government did not meet up with their demand. According to the statement signed by NANS leadership in Osun State, Comrade Afeez Oyewole, Comrade Salahudeen Abeebulah, Chairman and General Secretary respectively; and all the Students Union Presidents across the government owned tertiary institutions in the state. They stated that governments had executed rehabilitation and construction of more than 150KM of roads since the assumption of power without considering rehabilitation or full-fledged construction of institutions roads. In their arguments, the student body indicated that Osun state gesture on tertiary institution’s development worrisome saying “tertiary institution’s development is not part of the present-day government’s priority, as the deplorable state of roads is just the tip of the iceberg of poor infrastructure problems existing on different campuses.” NANS leadership, according to the statement, held a meeting with the State commissioner for work, Remi Omowaiye where “we agreed on rehabilitation of the deplorable state of institutions’ roads, having considered the meager resources of the state. It’s appalling, sardonic, and regrettable that since our last resolution, nothing cogent has been done to change the road status. “We thereby issue 12 days ultimatum to the Osun-State government to fix the campus roads network,” the statement read.
