Barcelona defender, Gerard Pique and his long-term partner, Shakira, are set to release a statement about their future after allegations of cheating in their relationship. The entertainment industry and football world has been rocked by claims that the pair are on the verge of splitting up after Pique was allegedly caught in bed with another woman. According to Spanish publication El Periodico, which is claimed as the source of the story, the “woman who could have put Pique and Shakira on the brink of breaking up” is “a young blonde in her 20s” who works as an “events hostess.” The report added that the under-pressure couple will soon make a statement on the situation, refusing to speculate about whether the alleged statement will be a denial, or an announcement of separation. Pique and Shakira’s relationship began in 2010. The duo are said to be living apart for a few weeks after Pique was kicked out of their family home by the popular pop singer. Despite never getting married, Pique and Shakira have two children together. They welcomed their son Milan, 9, in 2013, and daughter, Sasha, 7, in January 2015.
