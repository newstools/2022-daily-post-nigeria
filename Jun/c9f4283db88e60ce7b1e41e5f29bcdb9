Following the deadly Sunday attack that occurred at Saint Francis Catholic Church, Owo in Ondo State, the Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, has disclosed that the development is an indication that the country has collapsed under the APC led government. According to the pastor, who expressed grief over the killing of the worshippers by gunmen, President Muhammadu Buhari has brought nothing but agony and sorrow upon Nigeria. Giwa spoke while reacting to the attack where scores of people were killed. He added that he had been raising alarm over the activities of armed herders in the state, adding that nowhere is safe in the country. “Terrible incident in the history of Ondo State. If you could recall, precisely on January 8, 2022, I advised Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu on security. “Specifically, I also raised the alarm over the activities of herdsmen in the state. This is unfortunate. “Nigeria has collapsed under the administration of the APC. In the past, I had disclosed to Nigerians that President Muhammadu Buhari had given his fulani kinsmen power to terrorize the innocent citizens. “How could someone wake up and go to serve God, but fail to return home safely? “In Nigeria of today, you hardly sleep with your two eyes closed due to the failure of the present government to find a lasting solution to the nation’s security challenges. “Over the years, this administration has brought pain, agony and disaster to the country. My prayers are with the families of the victims.”
