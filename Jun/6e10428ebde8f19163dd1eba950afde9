The Jigawa State Police Command has warned residents to be very vigilant and report any suspicious movement around them to the nearest security formation. This was contained in a press statement signed by the command’s spokesman, ASP Lawan Shiisu Adam, made available to DAILY POST. He said the call became necessary in order to ensure maximum security of the residents and their properties. According to the statement, the ban on petroleum products beyond sixty (60) liters, restriction on the movement of motorcycle from 10pm to 6am, underage driving and overloading was still being enforced. He urged the residents to obey the directives, as the Command and other security agencies were strategically positioned to arrest undesirable elements and prosecute them before the court of law. “People should be very vigilant, report any suspicious faces/movement to the nearest Police Station. “Residents are also encouraged to support vigilantes within their areas and identify uncompleted buildings/ houses and be watchful on them,” he said.
