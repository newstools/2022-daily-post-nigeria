The Speaker of the Ebonyi State House of Assembly, Mr. Francis Ogbonnaya Nwifuru on Wednesday said he is the only gubernatorial candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, in Ebonyi State. Nwifuru, however, condemned in totality the rumour making the rounds in the state that there was an APC parallel primary election in the state. He made the condemnation while speaking with members of the correspondent chapel of the Nigeria Union of journalists, NUJ, Ebonyi State chapter during a courtesy visit, that took place at his lodge located along Ezza Road, Abakaliki. Nwifuru vowed that he would be sworn in as the next governor of Ebonyi State come May 29th, 2023. The Speaker claimed that Ebonyi State was one of the states that had a successful gubernatorial primary election in the country. He disclosed that it was only Julius Ali Ucha who petitioned the congress, which he said had been treated. “There was nothing like parallel congresses in Ebonyi APC. There was no petition from Ebonyi State. Only Julius Ucha submitted petition and it was treated. “Ebonyi is one of the five states without petition. I am the candidate for APC in the state.
