Manchester United have picked a replacement for departing second-choice goalkeeper, Dean Henderson. United want Watford goalkeeper Daniel Bachmann to replace the Englishman at Old Trafford. But, the Red Devils Will have to pay a transfer fee after Watford rejected the Austrian’s plea to let him leave on a free. Henderson is heading to newly promoted side, Nottingham Forest and Bachmann will take his place. The 27-year-old is so desperate to make the dream move to Manchester United and talkSPORT reports that he asked the Hornets to tear up his contract. With two years still to run on the deal, Watford are understandably keen to be properly reimbursed. An offer of around £3m should be enough for United to get their man.
