Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, has raised that alarm over planned exodus of some Senators from the All Progressives Congress, APC. Fani-Kayode disclosed that 22 senators are threatening to dump APC for the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP.

He urged the APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu to immediately reach out to them and resolve the issue. According to Fani-Kayode, the ruling party can’t afford to lose the 22 senators ahead of the 2023 general elections. He wrote: “22 APC Senators are threatening to decamp to PDP because they have been denied the tickets to return to the Senate. “This is serious and something must be done to prevent it. Many are concerned and we urge our able National Chairman National . Secretary to reach them. We cannot afford to lose them.”
