Senator Umaru Al-Makura, an APC chieftain from Nasarawa has said the choice of Bola Tinubu as the presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) is the best for Nigeria. Al-Makura, a member of the ‘Think-Tank of Tinubu for President’, made the claim during a meeting with various support groups from Nasarawa State for the candidate on Tuesday, NAN reports. The former governor referred to Tinubu as a soldier of democracy who alongside other patriots fought for democracy at the riskiest period of the country. He said Tinubu had transformed Lagos State as its governor from 1999 to 2007 to what it is currently. “Tinubu will perform the magic he did to ensure law and order which transformed Lagos State if elected in 2023. “He has paid his dues to ensure democratic government in the country and it is the right thing to elect such a person as the president, ” he added.
