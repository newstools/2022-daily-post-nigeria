Nollywood actor, Okon Lagos has disclosed that he will sell his votes during the 2023 general elections. The actor said he will sell his vote at a considerate price since Nigeria politicians visit the electorates just once every four years. “You see all these don’t sell your vote, don’t sell your vote e nor concern me because I have my PVC and I will sell my vote, I will sell my vote at a very considerate price. ”Because you know most of all these politicians that come to buy votes only appear once in your life every four years, buy your votes in the polling units and disappear and appear after another four years,” he said. Okon Lagos added that he will offer an exchange rate of N500 to a dollar for every day in a year.   A post shared by Ime Bishop Umoh 🇳🇬 (@okonlagos)
