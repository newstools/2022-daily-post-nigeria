Manchester United midfielder, Bruno Fernandes, has sent supportive messages to Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard after the club confirmed on Wednesday that both top players would leave Old Trafford this summer. Pogba and Lingard both came through Man United’s academy, featuring together in the 2011 FA Youth Cup win and helping the first-team lift multiple trophies. The France World Cup winner was on target in the 2017 Europa League final, while Lingard scored in both the 2016 FA Cup and 2017 EFL Cup finals. Reacting, Fernandes, who joined Man United in 2020, paid tribute to Pogba and Lingard on Instagram. The Portugal international said it was a pleasure to play alongside the departing stars. “It was a pleasure to play alongside you for this period. Nothing but the best for your future,” Fernandes said to Pogba, before telling Lingard: “I enjoyed having you as a teammate. Keep the good energy and never change that. Go and enjoy yourself always.”
