Akwa Ibom State Government has given a six-month ultimatum to owners of land in designated estates to commence building activities as contained in their allocation letters or risk revocation of the agreement. The designated estates include, Government Residential Estate (GRA) Nung Ette, GRA, Iba Oku and GRA, Ikot Oduot, Ibesikpo. Others are GRA, Nung Oku, commercial estate, Atan Offot and Employment Centre/Light industries. The Commissioner for Lands and Water Resources, Iniobong Ekong, who gave the hint in a statement issued in Uyo, stated that measures have been taken to encourage plot owners to commence immediate development of their plots. According to the statement, activities being undertaken were; opening of internal roads and mounting of electric poles within the estates as well as fencing and water reticulation in some of the estates. The commissioner urged plot owners to reciprocate government gestures by taking advantage of the move to commence building activities as soon as possible. He added, “But, failure to comply with the directive within six months might lead to the revocation of allocation earlier as contained in the letters of allocation.” Also, the commissioner warned persons involved in illegal acquisition of land to desist or risk punitive measures, as the state government was moving to check the menace of land-grabbing in the state. The commissioner gave the warning during a courtesy call on the State Commissioner of Police, Mr Amiengheme Andrew at the state police headquarter and the State Director of State Services Department. He mentioned that the visits were part of the ministry’s mandate in ensuring zero tolerance to illegal land grabbing and other crimes related to land and water.
