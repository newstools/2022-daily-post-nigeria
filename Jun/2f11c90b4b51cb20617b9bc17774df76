Former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Elder Godsday Orubebe has held a private meeting with Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State in Port Harcourt. This is coming three days after Orubebe dumped the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, citing injustice. Orubebe in his letter to the PDP Chairman, said the main opposition party was not ready to reclaim power from the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 general elections. Wike lost the presidential primary of the PDP to Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, who also ignored him in his choice of the vice presidential candidate and picked Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa instead. He has been holding a series of meetings with top politicians in Port Harcourt recently. On the same day, Wike received the Senate Minority Leader, Philip Aduda in Port Harcourt. Aduda led the leadership of the PDP in the Senate to meet with Wike two days after he was nominated as Minority Leader to replace the former, Enyinaya Abaribe who defected from the PDP. On the entourage were Deputy Minority Leader, Shuaibu Lau, Minority Whip, Chukwuka Utazi, and Deputy Minority Whip, Danjuma La’ah. Senator Barry Mpigi from Rivers State was on hand to receive the guests. The meeting was held behind closed-doors in the private residence of Governor Wike in Port Harcourt. The senators, who arrived at about 3:10 pm, departed at about 6 pm, without stating the purpose of their visit. Apart from Orubebe and the PDP leadership in the Senate, politicians who have visited Wike recently include the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, Governors Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State and Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State.
