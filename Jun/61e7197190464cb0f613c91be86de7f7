The Political Committee of the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU), has said any political party that unilaterally imposes the choice of a Deputy governorship candidate in the state without recourse to the socio-cultural and ethno-religious composition will forfeit the support of Southern Kaduna. SOKAPU said it believed in the principle of power-sharing between the North and South of the state as was in practice between 1999 and 2015, where the citizens of the state witnessed an equitable power sharing formula, deployed to give every zone a sense of belonging. In a statement issued by the Secretary of the group, Simon Reef Musa, “We look forward to the resumption of such power-sharing principles which went a long way in deepening our democratic experience.” The statement said there is no better time than now for all parties and both zones to work towards enthroning inclusiveness across the various parts of Kaduna State, stressing that in spite of the tension and animosity prevalent along ethno-religious divides, the Southern Kaduna people are committed to the welfare and security of all citizens of the state. The statement expressed concern over what it called “subtle threats mounted on governorship candidates” to appoint their running mates without regard to the ethno-religious divide in the state, adding that a video clip of a certain preacher warning against the consideration of ethno-religious options has made the rounds on social media platforms/ The group warned that any attempt to review Governor Nasir Ahmad el-Rufai’s imposition of Muslim-Muslim governorship ticket for Kaduna State would be stoutly resisted. It noted that the Southern Kaduna people are apprehensive at the inequitable distribution of democratic dividends in the state as it affects their zone, stating that the near-complete neglect of their communities and infrastructural development has stalled major development in Southern Kaduna. SOKAPU said it would never support any governorship candidate or party that attempts to continue with the unequal distribution of political appointments as is being witnessed under the present dispensation. The group explained that it believed that the permanent interests of the Southern Kaduna people are predicated on justice and equal treatment for all zones, pointing out that equality remains sacrosanct as a new basis for ensuring that all communities in Kaduna State are carried along.
