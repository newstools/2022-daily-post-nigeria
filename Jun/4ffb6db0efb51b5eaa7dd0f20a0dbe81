Popular Nollywood actress, Nkechi Blessing, has hit out at ex-aide to former President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri, after being compared to the National leader of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. Omokri, while reacting to the viral video of Tinubu where he took the credit for Buhari’s emergence in 2015, likened the former Lagos State Governor to Blessing and another Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh. He claimed Tinubu behaves like Blessing and Tonto Dikeh, who are exploding on the internet after they were promised marriage but never got to the altar. Omokri wrote on Twitter: “Tinubu is just behaving like Tonto Dikeh and Nkechi Blessing. Like a woman who was promised marriage and jilted and is now exploding and exposing the jilter. Buhari don buy market. He either builds another ‘other room’ for Tinubu, or marries him as promised!” In response to Omokri’s jab, Blessing said Omokri should not allow God to punish him, adding that he doesn’t have common sense. “I used to think you have sense but it’s obvious you lack common sense. Why put me in this context in the first place? Welcome to Nigeria, when a relationship ends, automatically it’s the man that left the woman…I for like talk more but Instagram guidelines won’t allow. Mr Reno leave my name out of your mouth..no let God P#nish you,” Nkechi wrote on Instagram.
