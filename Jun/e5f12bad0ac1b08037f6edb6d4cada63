Former England international, David James has shared his thoughts on Liverpool forward, Sadio Mane’s reported decision to leave Anfield this summer. James believes it’s the right opportunity for Mane to move to another country after winning a number of trophies with Liverpool. Mane, 30, has been heavily linked with a move away from Liverpool this summer in the past few days. Reports had emerged that the 30-year-old is set to join Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich. Mane has just over a year left on his current deal with Liverpool with reports claiming that the former Southampton star will cost more than £30 million this summer. He has been a key figure in Liverpool’s success in recent seasons and has scored 23 goals and registered five assists in his 51 appearances across the campaign. Speaking to GGRecon, James said: “This is a guy that has won so much and done so well with Liverpool. I look at him in a very positive way. This is a guy that has traveled around in his career a little bit, and therefore the idea that he could travel to another country would make sense.” He added: “Having just turned 30, he is sort of at the height of his powers. He has been successful with a number of trophies with Liverpool, especially with two trophies this year, and with Senegal, qualifying for the World Cup and winning the Africa Cup of Nations, which is one of the major things he wanted to achieve.” “For any performer you would say, where is my best opportunity for me to make the next move and I would argue that now for Mane it’s the right opportunity. It is nothing against Liverpool. I don’t think many would argue against it.”
