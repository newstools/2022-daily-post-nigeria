The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, has said no arm of government should be allowed to lord over others. Atiku was reacting to the Supreme Court judgement which struck out the suit by President Muhammadu Buhari seeking to void the provision of section 84 (12) of the Electoral Amendment Act 2022. The Supreme Court said the President lacked the power to direct the National Assembly to amend or enact an act, adding that it violated the principle of separation of power. According to the judgement, there is no part of the Constitution that makes the exercise of legislative power subject to the directive of the President. Reacting, Atiku tweeted: “The ruling of the Supreme Court on Section 84 (12) is commendable. “It affirms my position of the independence of the judiciary and the other arms of government, namely the legislature and the executive, which is the bedrock for the development of any nation. “Under no circumstance must one arm lord over another arm of government. -AA”
