An 80-year-old identified as Saleh Bukar has been arrested by the Borno State Police Command for allegedly defiling an 11-year-old girl. The Police Commissioner, Abdu Umar, said this on Wednesday, while parading Bukar and six other rape suspects at the command’s headquarters in Maiduguri. Umar said that the victim’s elder sister, Fatima Ali, got to know about the incident, when she reportedly noticed an unusual discharge from the victim’s virgina. According to him, the victim later opened up to Ali and alleged that Bukar had raped her on different occasions. He added that the suspect would be charged to court at the end of the investigations.
