An All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain, Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, has congratulated presidential candidate Bola Ahmed Tinubu for his victory at the just-concluded national convention. Olawepo-Hashim urged Tinubu to unite the party regardless of those who did not support his ambition. Tinubu, a former Senator and former Governor of Lagos, beat 13 others to emerge as the flagbearer of the party at a special convention held at the Eagle Square, Abuja, last Wednesday. In a statement from his media office in Abuja on Sunday, Olawepo-Hashim urged Tinubu to “truly walk the talk of his victory speech at the convention that he holds no bitterness against those who did not support him at the Primaries for the task at hand needs everyone’s support.” He commended Tinubu for visiting President Muhammadu Buhari; party Chairman, Sen. Abdullahi Adamu; Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State and Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State among others. Olawepo-Hashim also urged the party to come together to ensure Tinubu is victorious in the 2023 elections, saying the coalition that will guarantee victory in the 2023 polls is different from the one that delivered the presidential ticket. The former presidential aspirant also hailed “all those who participated in the exercise, especially Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, for a good impact; Vice President Yemi Osinbajo for a robust campaign that raised hope; Senate President Ahmed Lawan, for a great showing within two weeks of joining the contest. “Also, I must not fail to mention the youthful Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, who brought a lot of energy to the contest and all others who competed,” he said.
