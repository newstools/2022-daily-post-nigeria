Football lawmakers have authorised trials of Kick-ins replacing throw-ins in football. Arsenal legend and FIFA chief Arsene Wenger, has also backed the idea which, according to him, would make the game quicker. The new idea was among a number of issues and potential changes that were discussed on Monday at the general meeting of the International Football Association Board (Ifab) in Doha. Throw-ins have been used in the round-leather game since the 1860s, with the Football Association banning the kick-in option in 1863. Ifab confirmed that Dutch second division could be used for the trial as the kick-ins is set made a comeback. Wenger, now working at FIFA as the head of its global development, has previously backed kick-ins to reduce time-wasting and have a positive influence on the game. ‘There are two big time-wasters at the moment, that is throw-ins and free-kicks, and a little bit goal-kicks as well because when you play out now in the box,’ he said last year. ‘The target is to make the game more spectacular and quicker, and maybe with throw-ins you could play with your feet, but in a limit of five seconds for example, things like that. ‘But it has to be tested and then has to be accepted by the Ifab.’
