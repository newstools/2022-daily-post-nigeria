The 11 Abuja-Kaduna train kidnap victims, who were released on Saturday, have all been taken to the nation’s capital, Abuja. A source, who disclosed this to DAILYPOST on Sunday morning, said they were taken to an undisclosed hospital for check up, at the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), and will later be reunited with their families. Kidnappers had abducted Abuja-Kaduna train passengers on March 28, 2022, after bombing the train track. They killed nine and wounded several other passengers. The bandits had demanded for the release of their children in security custody as part of negotiation for the release of the over 60 kidnapped victims. However, on Saturday June 11, 2022, the bandits released 11 hostages, remaining 49 victims still in hostage, as they earlier released MD bank of Agriculture and a pregnant woman. The Publisher of Desert Herald, Tukur Mamu, facilitated the release of the victims who spent over 70 days in captivity. It was gathered that the 11 victims regained their freedom after eight children of their abductors were released to them on Saturday. A source hinted DAILY POST correspondent that instead of the terrorists releasing all female captives as earlier agreed, they released six vulnerable females and five males said to be suffering from deteriorating health condition.
