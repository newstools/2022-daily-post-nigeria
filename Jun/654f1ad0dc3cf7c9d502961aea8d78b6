Real Madrid’s new signing, Antonio Rudiger, has given his verdict on teammate Eden Hazard at Santiago Bernabeu. Rudiger, who played alongside Hazard during their time at Chelsea between 2017 and 2019, said the Belgian star is one of the best players in the world. The duo have now been reunited at Real Madrid, with the club signing Rudiger following the expiry of his contract at Stamford Bridge this summer. Speaking to Real Madrid’s official website, Rudiger expressed his happiness at being reunited with Hazard, backing the attacking midfielder to get back to his best soon at Real Madrid. The defender said (as quoted by CaughtOffside): “I’m very happy to be with Eden again, now at Madrid. “I know it has been a tough few years for him, with a lot of injuries and problems, but I still hope Madrid fans can see the Hazard I played with because he was undoubtedly one of the best players in the world.”
