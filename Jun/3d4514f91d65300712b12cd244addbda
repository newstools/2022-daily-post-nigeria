A former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, has debunked reports that he stepped down from the presidential race for Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Reports had emerged on Saturday that Akpabio had stepped down and endorsed Tinubu. It was reported that Akpabio endorsed Tinubu after Buhari met with the All Progressives Congress presidential aspirant. But reacting, Akpabio in a statement issued on Sunday by his Director, Media and Publicity, Sylvester Okonkwo, described the report as fake. “The attention of the Godswill Akpabio Campaign Organisation (GACO) has been drawn to a news item in an online news platform, purporting that our presidential hopeful and the choice of the majority of Nigerians in the 2023 presidential race, Senator Godswill Akpabio, has stepped down for a particular aspirant. “Ordinarily, we would have allowed this to slide, because we view it as the wishful thinking of some mischief makers hired by some politicians to misinform and misdirect the resolve of the teeming supporters of our aspirant from casting their votes for him at the party’s Special Convention for the presidential primary, hence this response,” the statement read. Okonkwo maintained that Akpabio is still in the race and has no reason to withdraw nor is he thinking about it. According to him, the former Akwa Ibom State Governor is in the race to also emerge as the President of Nigeria.
