Former Niger State Governor, Babangida Aliyu has made fresh claims over why the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) did not pick Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, as his running mate. According to him, Wike talks too much and does not compliment Atiku. Featuring on Channels Television’s Political Paradigm, Aliyu claimed Wike “insulted his way to power”. He said: “You do not go around choosing people that will not compliment you. “You choose people who will compliment your office. People that are ready to take over from you and will make you comfortable. “Unfortunately, I don’t know if it is his power. Sometimes when you speak too much. When you insult your way to power, it does not always happen. “I can count many people who he has insulted. People will say he is always speaking his mind. But there are times you don’t need to speak your mind.” Atiku last week, picked the Governor of Delta State, Ifeanyi Okowa, as his running mate. Explaining his choice, Atiku stated that Okowa possesses all the qualities needed for the job of Vice President.
