A statement signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Christian Ita, quoted Professor Ayade in a congratulatory message to Tinubu as expressing an “unwavering optimism that this soldier of democracy who has seen it all will lead our great party to victory.” He assured the Tinubu of his total support at the polls. Ayade said: “Your Excellency, from your NADECO days to the ACN era and then to your immeasurable contribution to the formation of APC and its subsequent ascension to power, there is no doubt that you have laboured and sacrificed for democracy and its enthronement in our nation. “Therefore, your emergence as the presidential candidate of our great party is a fitting and deserving reward for a man who has been in the trenches for democracy and good governance for decades now. “I have an unwavering belief that as a soldier of democracy who has seen it all, you will lead the APC to seamless victory next year. Rest assured that as your look back, you will find me matching with you 100 per cent to the threshold of victory. “I heartily and warmly congratulate you on this monumental milestone.”
