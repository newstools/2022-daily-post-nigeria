The Rapid Response Squad (RRS) of the Lagos State Police Command has taken three alleged fraudsters into custody. A statement by Police Public Relations Officer, Benjamin Hundeyin announced their arrest. The suspects targeted unsuspecting members of the public while disguising themselves as driver and passengers. The trio were intercepted by Lagos State Neighbourhood Safety Corp (LSNSC) operatives in Opebi, Ikeja, following a tip-off. Dele Olawale (52), Remi Ogunleye (45) and Kole Akintunjoye (40) reside in Ogun State but resume in Lagos daily to prey on commuters. The police said they operated in a Volkswagen Golf with registration number KRD 998 DE and act like strangers in order to entrap their victims. “They carried out their nefarious activities mostly in Lagos Island, Lekki and Ikoyi”, Hundeyin noted. RRS Commander, CSP Olayinka Egbeyemi has transferred the case to the police headquarters for further investigation.
