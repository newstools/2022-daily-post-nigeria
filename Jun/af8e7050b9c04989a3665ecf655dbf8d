Turkish giants, Besiktas are working on a deal to sign forward Henry Onyekuru on a permanent deal from Olympiacos. Besiktas are in the market for a new striker with Canada’s Cyle Larin set to join Premier League new boys, Nottingham Forest this summer. Larin has rejected the offer of a new deal from Besiktas and the club are prepared to let the striker move to England. Onyekuru is looking to quit Olympiacos after a below-par campaign. The Nigerian scored one goal in 27 league appearances for the Greek champions last season. It is reported he is not in manager Pedro Martins’ plans for the upcoming season.
