Guinea Bissau have gone top of Group A of the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying series. This follows their 5-1 win over Sao Tome and Principe. Nigeria could only manage a 2-1 home win over Sierra Leone. Guinea Bissau have three points, same as Nigeria, but enjoy a healthier goals difference of +4 to Nigeria’s +1. They will next week visit Sierra Leone, while Nigeria play away to bottom team Sao Tome. The top two teams from each group will advance to the AFCON in Cote d’Ivoire next year.
