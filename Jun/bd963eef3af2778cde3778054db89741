The chairperson of the Taraba State chapter of the Labour Party (LP), Esther Gulmu, on Monday in Jalingo, the state capital, said Nigerians are vehemently yearning for good governance. Esther, who stated this while playing host to the supporters of the party’s presidential candidate, Peter Obi, in the state, believed that what Nigerians are presently in dire need of is a leader that will take the people out of the dungeon of slavery. She said, “The Peter Obi revolution that we are all seeing today is a clear indication that Nigerians are tired of bad leadership. “It is a known fact that Nigeria is in a very bad shape, from security, to economy, to our social life, and every aspect of the country. It is time to change the narrative or we will live with it for another eight years.” She added that the Labour Party in Taraba is ready to win both the governorship seat and the presidential election in 2023. “No pension, no gratuity, no salary, particularly the primary school teachers, and our local government workers are suffering, we can’t continue like this,” she lamented. Tarabans and Nigerians at large, according to her, will be faced with a decision in 2023, stressing that “it is either we want to suffer for another eight years in this state and Nigeria, or we want to change the narratives.” Though the party, at the time of filing this report, has no gubernatorial candidate for Taraba State, she, however, assured the supporters that in no distant time, the party would unveil the name of the right man for the job. Since the creation of the state in 1991 and the advent of democracy in 1999, Esther, as noticed by DAILY POST, is the first female chairperson that is presiding over the affairs of a political party.
