Chairman/CEO Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM), Hon. Abike Dabiri-Erewa, has described the death of 42-year-old Mr Lucky Ndubuisi Chikezie in Pretoria, South Africa as very worrisome and painful. In a statement by Gabriel Odu of the Media, Public Relations and Protocols Unit of NIDCOM, Dabiri-Erewa said the circumstances of Lucky’s arrest, detention and eventual death was very unsettling and heartbreaking. The NIDCOM boss consoled the family of the deceased , and friends and prayed unto God to grant him eternal rest. She calls for justice for the family and pleads with Nigerians in South Africa to be patient as investigation is being carried out. She, however, advised the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) to conduct an in depth investigation into the arrest, detention and assault of Lucky and unravel the circumstances which led to his eventual death allegedly at the hands of Tshwane Metro Police Department (TMPD) Pretoria, South Africa. The deceased wife in a report stated that “Mr Chikezie suffered untold brutality at the hands of the members of the police officers and later succumbed to injuries he sustained on his head due to internal bleeding in the early hours on Wednesday, June 22, at Akasia Netcare Centre in Pretoria”.
