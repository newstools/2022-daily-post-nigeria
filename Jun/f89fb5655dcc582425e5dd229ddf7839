Former head coach of the Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr has named Samuel Kalu, as one of the best dribblers in Europe. Rohr said this while trying to explain the reason behind the 24-year-old’s recent decline that has kept him out of the Super Eagles team. Kalu joined Girondins Bordeaux from Belgian side KAA Gent in August 2018 and made his national team debut the following month. Rohr confessed he gave Kalu his Super Eagles debut because Bordeaux asked for it to enable them to facilitate the approval of the young playmaker’s contract with the league authorities. Kalu earned all 17 international caps under Rohr, scoring two goals. Kalu has also been out of favour at the club level, managing just 11 appearances for Bordeaux before switching to Watford in January where he has featured in only four matches before they were relegated to the Championship. Rohr believes Kalu’s decline is because he played for coaches who did not show enough confidence in the player’s ability. “But Samuel Kalu was an excellent dribbler, one of the best dribblers in Europe. He had impressive dribbling stats. I think that, unfortunately, they didn’t know…,” Rohr told AquiTélé as per Girondins4ever. “There were also a lot of coaches. Kalu had still played quite a bit with Paulo Sousa at one point; then, I saw some good matches with Jean-Louis Gasset. “Then there was no longer that confidence, he needed to make a difference. He’s a sensitive player,” he added.
