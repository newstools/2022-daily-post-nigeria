Abdulkadir Nasiru, a 20-year-old construction worker, lost his life while Nasiru Shafiu, his co-worker, sustained injuries as a three-storey building collapsed in Kanti Kwari textile market in Kano State on Tuesday. The third floor of the building was under construction while the second and first floors of the building had been completed before it collapsed around 12:35 pm. A source at the scene told Daily Post that most buildings in the market are not built to professional standards. According to him, people indiscriminately add extra floors to their buildings without professional advice. Saminu Yusif, spokesperson of the Kano State Fire Service, while confirming the incident, attributed the cause of the incident to the use of substandard building materials. He explained, “We received a distress call around noon on Tuesday about the incident. A three-storey building under construction collapsed in Unity Road, Kantin Kwari market.” The spokesman stated that two persons were trapped inside the building, saying that one Abdulkadir Nasir, a 20-year-old, was rescued while the other, Naziru Shafiu, a 30-year-old, was recovered dead. He added that the corpse was evacuated to Nasarawa Specialist Hospital.
