Many community members in Dansadau emirate of Zamfara State have lamented that they do not have access to their farms as bandits have taken over their lands. According to some of the villagers who spoke with DAILY POST on phone, they had to pay levies for the bandits to allow them to cultivate their farms, especially during this year’s rainy season. “Some villages had to pay N20 million naira as a levy, the bandits were even demanding free access to the farms after its cultivation” DAILY POST can authoritatively state that Dansadau axis had been a colony of banditry before the bandits overtook every part of the state. Kuyabana forest is one of the forests in the Dansadau Emirate where bandits have their camps and hideouts, from where they move to nearby villages to unleash terror attacks on innocent citizens of the state. Most of the communities have embarked on fervent prayers to seek divine intervention, even as they urged the federal and Zamfara State governments to demonstrate enough political will to tackle the menace that has been ravaging the axis for over a decade. Mohammed Dansadau, a resident of the area and a farmer said the spate of killings, kidnappings and cattle rustling has escalated in the troubled area. Dansadau appealed to the authorities to address the unfortunate development to save the souls of the residents from the constant insecurity in the area. “The farmers can no longer engage in their farming activities due to constant operations of the bandits in the Dansadau axis, So we want the federal and Zamfara State governments to take proactive steps, to enable residents go about their legitimate endeavours. However, the state police authority could not be reached as the two lines of the state’s police spokesman, SP Mohammed Shehu was switched off following many attempts.
