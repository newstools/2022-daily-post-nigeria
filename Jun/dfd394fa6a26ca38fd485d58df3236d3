Paris Saint-Germain midfielder, Leandro Paredes, revealed an incident where forward Lionel Messi showed his angry side. Paredes said he wanted to kill himself because of Messi, adding that the seven-time Ballon d’Or winner was really angry. During the 2021-22 season, PSG faced Messi’s Barcelona in the Champions League round of 16. The French Ligue 1 champions defeated Barcelona 5-2 on aggregate to qualify for the quarter-final. However, Paredes, has now recalled a feisty confrontation with Messi from that tie. The 27-year-old said (via Mundo Deportivo): “He [Messi] got angry, because I had made a comment towards my teammates, and he listened to me, and he got hot. “He was really hot. He F****d the s**t out of me, bad. I wanted to kill myself; I wanted to go home.” Paredes and Messi are now much closer to each other. The duo are also teammates on the international stage with Argentina as well at the club level with PSG. They were part of the Argentina squad that had a successful international break this month as La Albiceleste defeated Italy 3-0 in the 2022 Finalissima at the Wembley Stadium on June 1.
