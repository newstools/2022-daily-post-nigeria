Barcelona forward, Ousmane Dembele, has revealed the club he would play for next season while responding to speculation he wants to leave the Nou Camp and join Chelsea this summer. Dembele’s current contract with Barcelona will expire this summer. The 25-year-old, who is yet to sign a new contract with Barcelona, has endured an underwhelming spell at the Catalan club and only scored two goals in 32 appearances last season. Reports in Spain have suggested that the France World Cup winner is open to leaving Barcelona and is keen to join his former manager, Thomas Tuchel, at Chelsea, who have expressed interest in a summer deal. But Dembele has seemingly crushed Chelsea’s hopes of securing his services this summer by telling a fan he is ‘fine’ at Barcelona and will be staying put at the LaLiga giants next season. Footage that has emerged on social media shows a fan interacting with Dembele as they sit in their cars at a traffic light. “Are you staying in Barcelona?’ the fan asks, with Dembele replying: ‘Yes.’ Meanwhile, Spanish outlet Sport says the supporter then asks specifically about Chelsea and whether Dembele wants to work with Tuchel at the west London club, to which he replies: “I’m fine at Barcelona.”
