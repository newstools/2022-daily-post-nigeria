Professor Mahmood Yakubu, Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has said the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration which was initially scheduled to end on June 30, 2022, has been extended. He said this on Saturday. The Federal High Court in Abuja had earlier stopped INEC from ending the ongoing voter registration exercise. Professor Yakubu, during the Youth Vote Count concert at the Old Parade Ground, Abuja, on Saturday, said, “I want to assure you on behalf of the commission that the registration won’t end on June 30 for as long as we have you people trying to register, we will continue to register you.” According to him, “in the last five days, we have registered over 14,000 Nigerians in this place alone. We have about 50 voter registration machines. For as long as you people have been trying to register to obtain your PVC, we will continue to register you and we will continue to make sure that you get your PVC.”
