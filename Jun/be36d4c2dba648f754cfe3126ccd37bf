Romelu Lukaku will seal his return to Inter Milan this week, as Chelsea are close to agreeing terms of his loan fee. The Serie A club has increased their opening offer of £6million to £8.5m with add-ons. According to the Daily Mail, a further video call is scheduled for Monday. Chelsea have discussed potential discount on Inter players as part of negotiations with Milan Skriniar and Denzil Dumfries among the names floated. However, it is expected to be a straight loan deal as it stands. New co-owner Todd Boehly was reluctant to let £97.5m signing Lukaku go but was convinced it was best for all parties once the Belgian made it clear how determined he was to leave.
