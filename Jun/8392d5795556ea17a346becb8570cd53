Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has called on the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, Peter Obi to see to the release of the governorship candidate of the party in the last gubernatorial election in Anambra State, Obiora Agbasimalo. Obiora reportedly went missing during the election and no one has heard from or seen him since then and his mother, Ada Agbasimalo, has called on the government and security agencies to help find the whereabouts of her son. Obiora was among the contestants in the governorship election won by candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, Prof. Chukwuemeka Soludo. His mother said that her political son was whisked away a few months to the actual election. Mrs. Agbasimalo has also written an open letter seeking the intervention of distinguished Senator, Ifeanyi Ubah’s help in fast tracking the release of her son, Obiora. According to the letter written by his mother, the LP candidate was kidnapped on September 18th, 2021 at Lilu in Ihiala Local Government Area, on their way to Azia also in Ihiala Local Government Area. Mother of the missing politician is calling on Anambra South Senator, Ifeanyi Uba, to help her in securing the release of her son, adding that “As his mother, I have been traumatised and agonised to the extent that I now have serious heart issues.” HURIWA, addressing the press through its National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko, on the matter, called on Obi to intervene. “We appeal to the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, to also look at the issue of the disappearance, kidnap of the governorship candidate of his party in the last election. “He should use his privileged status to ensure that security institutions do all they can to ensure his release,” the human rights advocacy group said.
