The National Chairman of the APC, Alhaji Abdullahi Adamu, has congratulated Mr. Biodun Oyebanji, APC Governor-elect of Ekiti, on his victory. This is contained in a statement signed by Mr. Samuel Jimba, Senior Special Adviser (SSA) to the APC chairman, and made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday. He explained that the victory was a result of the achievements of the party, the popularity of the candidate, as well as the strong campaign strategies put in place by the APC. According to Adamu, the governor-elect has the pedigree, experience, and vision to take Ekiti to the next level of development. Adamu also thanked the people of Ekiti for reposing their confidence in the APC and their candidate. He promised that the new governor would continue to implement people-oriented programmes of the party as already started by Gov. Kayode Fayemi. Adamu also said this was the first victory the party recorded since he became the chairman, and expressed optimism that they would win the Osun governorship election later this year, as well as the 2023 general elections. The chairman also lauded President Muhammadu Buhari, who, as the leader of the APC, provided guidance for the party going into the Ekiti election. He thanked the Ekiti APC campaign council led by Gov. Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi, the state Working Committee of the party, as well as supporters for their hard work, dedication, and vigilance which led to the victory. He, therefore, urged the governor-elect to be magnanimous in victory as he sets out to deliver on the mandate of the people of Ekiti.
