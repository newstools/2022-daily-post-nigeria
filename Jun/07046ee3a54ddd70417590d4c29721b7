Leaders Rivers United, who had their lead cut down to seven points following a 1-0 defeat to Wikki Tourists last weekend will entertain Abia Warriors at the Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium, Port Harcourt. A win for Stanely Eguma’s side will see them further sewn up the title with four games remaining before the end of the campaign. Second-placed Plateau United will travel to Ibadan where they will be guests of Shooting Stars.

At the deep end of the table, MFM and Dakkada looked destined for relegation from the NPFL.
