Niger State Commissioner for Health and Hospital Services, Dr. Muhammad Maikusidi has identified five local governments as the worst hit by maternal mortality in the state. The five council areas that have contributed to the rise of the situation include Mariga, Agaie, Gurara, Lapai and Mashegu of the state. Speaking at a capacity building workshop for journalists organised by Pathfinder International in Minna, the commissioner said the State Government is working tirelessly along with developmental partners to reduce maternal mortality. Maikusidi who spoke through the Director, planning and research, Dr. Junaidu Umar, Niger State Primary Health Care Development Agency explained that in the latest statistics obtained by the Nigeria Demographic Health Survey NDHS of 2018, Nigeria recorded 512,000 deaths out of every live birth which he said is the second-highest in the world. According to him,” we cannot compare our situation to some
countries like Sweden which has one death in every 1000 live birth ” The commissioner further stated to tackle the situation, the State Government has deliberately formulated policies targeted at improving access to health care facilities at the grassroots and intensified advocacy through civil society organisations Earlier, Dr. Andrew Okoh, the Secretary of the Child spacing advocacy working group had called on the State Government to create a dedicated budget line for childbirth spacing and ensure the timely release of funds. Also, Mr. Bayo Ewouola of pathfinder international revealed that the fertility rate of Nigeria stands at 5.3 and there is a need for the government to ensure that population control mechanisms are put in place before the country’s population geometrically rises to 420 million by 2050. “Nigeria is currently the 6th most populous country on earth, with a fertility ratio of 5.3. ”Nigeria’s population will likely hit 420 Million people by 2050 if nothing is done to control the geometric birth rate, ” he added.
