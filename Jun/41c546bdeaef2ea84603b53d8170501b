Asanting community in Ibiono Ibom Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State has declared one Ukeme Albert, an acclaimed youth leader wanted over alleged cases of terrorism and vandalisation of properties in the community. The village head, Eteidung Ime Udoaka, who disclosed this while briefing newsmen on Sunday at his palace, said the community has informed the security agencies about the ugly situation, adding that they have launched a manhunt for the man. Udoaka claimed that the fleeing suspect was behind the vandalization of the community infrastructure which include: water project donated by Winners Chapel, Palm Oil Mill built by the people and stealing of cows belonging to herdsmen in the area. Narrating the incident, Obong Udoaka, said trouble started in the village when Ukeme returned to the village and claimed to be the leader of Asanting village, thereby causing trouble in the community. He accused the suspect of selling the village disputed land to a church as well as selling the village electricity transformer to some Igbo traders. He added that Ukeme was terrorizing a dredging company working in the village and forcing them to pay N250,000 monthly to him untill the village council intervened through security agencies. His words, “The youth leader, Ukeme Albert went with his gang to the village stream and intimidated workers of a dredging company here and forced them to pay him N250,000 and the village council intervened to stop it after he had collected the cash for many months “The youth leader also went to the site where Winners Chapel Church is building Faith Academy School and intimidated workers for contracts and other incentives. “He vandalized the water project that was provided by the Church for the community and also destroyed the Palm Oil Mill built by the community and escaped.” He urged security agencies to fish out the absconded youth leader to face charges of cultism and terrorism which has been reported against him.
