At least four presidential aspirants under the All Progressives Congress (APC) did not record a single vote at the just concluded primary. They are: former Imo State Governor Rochas Okorocha; General Overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church Tunde Bakare; Oil magnate, Tein Jack-Rich and former Minister of Information, Ikeobasi Mokelu. The APC National Leader, Bola Tinubu, was declared winner with 1,217 votes. Tinubu secured almost four times the votes garnered by a former transportation minister, Rotimi Amaechi, who placed second with 316 votes. Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo finished in third with 235 votes, Senate President Ahmad Lawan got 152 votes; while the governor of Kogi, Yahaya Bello had 47 votes. 28 aspirants bought APC’s nomination and expression of forms, but only 23 of the presidential hopefuls appeared before the screening committee. Seven aspirants stepped down for Tinubu. Nicholas Felix, a US-based Nigerian pastor of the Miracle Church International, withdrew from the race and asked his supporters to back Osinbajo. Eventually, the names of 14 aspirants were listed as participants in the primary.
