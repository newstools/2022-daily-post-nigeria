Chairman of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in Benue State, Sir John Ngbede, has emerged as the deputy governorship candidate of the party for the forthcoming gubernatorial election in the state. This was disclosed on Sunday evening by Governor Samuel Ortom, during the expanded caucus meeting of the party and flag bearers for various positions at the banquet hall of the People’s House, Makurdi. Ngbede, who hails from Obagaji, Agatu local government of the state, was favoured due to the in-house zoning arrangement of the party and his long-standing commitment to PDP. Apa/Agatu is the only zone that has not served as deputy governor of Benue State amongst the four federal constituencies of Benue South, the Idoma-speaking area. Ngbede will be deputising Rt. Hon. Titus Uba, the current Speaker of Benue State House of Assembly, who emerged as the guber flag bearer of the party from Vandeikya local government of the state.
