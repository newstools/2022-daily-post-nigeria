The Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo has felicitated all Nigerian men on the occasion of the 2022 World Father’s Day. Osinbajo in a post on his social media handles on Sunday, wished all Dads, father figures and Dads-to-be a happy Father’s Day. The former presidential aspirant said fathers occupy a critical position in the family as their actions and inactions affect society. He said, “Fathers are the first line examples for what becomes obtainable in the society. They have and play a critical role in leaving a mark through their actions and inaction, from which building blocks for society are formed. “To the great Dads, father figures, Dads-to-be and those doubling as mentors to many out there, I wish you all a Happy Father’s Day. God bless you”. DAILY POST reports that Father’s Day was founded in the United States of America, at the Spokane in Washington YMCA, in 1910 by Sonora Smart Dodd and celebrated every June 19.
