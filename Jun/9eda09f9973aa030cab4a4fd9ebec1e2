Roma manager, Jose Mourinho, wants to keep Tammy Abraham at the club, despite strong interest from the Premier League. Abraham was one of Mourinho’s first signings for the Serie A side, joining from Chelsea for €40m. The 24-year-old striker hit the ground running for the Giallorossi, netting 17 goals in Serie A and 27 in all competitions as Roma lifted the Europa Conference League. His form has seen Manchester United and Arsenal ready to test Roma’s resolve in the transfer market. However, according to Corriere Dello Sport (via Football Italia), Mourinho considers Abraham to be unsellable. Abraham himself is not thought to be in any hurry to leave the Stadio Olimpico, so the Premier League sides may have to turn their attention to other targets.
