President Muhammadu Buhari has said that he does not have a preferred candidate ahead of the party’s presidential primaries. Buhari also told Northern Governors, who were in Aso Rock to meet with him concerning where the next President should come from to “allow the delegates to decide. The Party must participate, nobody will appoint anybody.” The President on Monday afternoon said it was important to clear all doubts about where he stands on the choice of a presidential candidate. Buhari, according to Garba Shehu, made the declaration before the party’s 14 governors of northern states. According to the President, “no preferred candidate,” and has “anointed no one,” and is determined to ensure that “there shall be no imposition of any candidate on the party.” Buhari said the party is important and its members must be respected, and made to feel they are important. The President said he had a clear mind about what he was doing and asked the APC governors to feel the same way. Meanwhile, reports emerged on Monday that the National Chairman of the ruling party, Abdullahi Adamu has picked Senate President Ahmad Lawan as the presidential candidate of the party. However, members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the APC have denied endorsing Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, as the consensus presidential candidate of the party.
