Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel has drawn up a six-man list of striker targets for the summer. The Blues are very keen to strengthen their front line, considering their lack of goals this past season. Romelu Lukaku is looking likely to leave Stamford Bridge and that will accelerate a new striker or versatile attacker to Tuchel’s squad. According to The Guardian, Bayern’s Robert Lewandowski, Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, RB Leipzig’s Christopher Nkunku, and Benfica’s Darwin Nunez are serious options for Chelsea. Tuchel is also believed to be showing interest in Lille’s Jonathan David, while Barcelona’s Ousmane Dembele is a favorite from their time at Borussia Dortmund.
