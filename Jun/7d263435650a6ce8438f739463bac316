The General Overseer of Faith Foundation Ministry International, Pastor Yarima El- Samaila has decried the growing level of fake news in the country, saying it poses a great threat to the peace and corporate existence of Nigeria. He also warned politicians to desist from spreading fake news about their perceived opponents, adding that Nigerians cannot be swayed or deceived by fake news and propaganda used to smear the name of opponents. Samaila explained that the growing level of fake news in the country is not only worrisome but capable of creating panic and disunity among Nigerians. The clergy in a signed press statement in Minna, the Niger State condemned in strongest terms “the heartless and evil wish against the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbanjo who was said to be involved in an auto crash when he was rendering sacrificial service to his fatherland. Pastor Yarima who was a former Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) Chairman in Niger State, appealed to Nigerians, regardless of their political differences, to always respect, pray and wish leaders well, arguing that “such evil wishes against a fellow and respected personalities is evil and ungodly”. He also appealed to politicians and also the media not to overheat the polity as such an open display of propaganda will not strengthen the country’s growing democracy. “We should strive to promote issues and proffer solutions aimed at bailing our nation from factors which threaten peace and stability of our beloved country”.
