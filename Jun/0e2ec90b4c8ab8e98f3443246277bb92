Following the imminent arrival of left-back Tyrell Malacia, Manchester United are prepared to let three stars, Alex Telles, Brandon Williams and Alvaro Fernandez leave the club. Malacia is on the verge of joining Manchester United from Dutch side Feyenoord after the Red Devils launched a late bid for the 22-year-old on Monday night. Talks over personal terms between representatives of both parties progressing well and Netherlands international could join in coming days. For the left full-back position, the Dutch star is expected to compete with Luke Shaw for a first-team role next season. And The Times reports that the likes of Telles and Williams will be moved on as a result. Malacia’s arrival could also see academy star Fernandez look elsewhere for first-team opportunities.
