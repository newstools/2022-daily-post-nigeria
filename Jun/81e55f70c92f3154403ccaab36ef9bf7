Alhaji Tanko Yakasai, an elder statesman and founding member of the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), has opined that the emergence of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu as All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate signifies important political development for Nigeria. Yakasai made the remarks on Thursday in his congratulatory message to Tinubu. He said the election of Tinubu is indeed an important political development for Nigeria. Yakasai, who described Tinubu as a political juggernaut and a sage, noted that this is the first time the major political parties are fielding non-military actors as their presidential flagbearers and it would signify the complete and total break away from military influence in the nation’s polity. He said that it would bring about the return of Nigeria to a full-fledged democratic tradition and practice for the first time, since the return of civilian rule in 1999. “This transition will be a milestone and will lead us to a full fledged democracy,” he said. He urged all candidates vying for various political positions in the country to commit themselves to the principles of playing politics according to the rules of the game.
