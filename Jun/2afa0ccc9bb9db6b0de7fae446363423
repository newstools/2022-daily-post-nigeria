The Kogi West Senator, Smart Adeyemi, has said Senators would not abandon former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu amid the controversy of organ harvesting. Adeyemi said Senators are making efforts to see how to support Ekweremadu despite the allegations of organ harvesting. Ekweremadu and his wife, Beatrice were accused of trafficking an alleged minor to the United Kingdom, for organ harvesting. The couple were charged with conspiracy to arrange and facilitate the travel of another person, with a view for exploitation, namely organ harvesting. A London Court denied the couple bail and remanded them despite pleading not guilty to the charge against them. However, Smart said Senators stand with Ekweremadu amid his travail. Speaking with Channels Television on Friday, Adeyemi said, “This issue is most unfortunate. It’s something that is very disturbing to everybody in the Senate because he is one of us; but more importantly, is the fact that I know him to be a man of great value and strength of character; a man with a very high moral foundation. “But having said this, I think it is too early to start apportioning blame as to whether he is guilty or not. All of us who are colleagues, are feeling the pains and we are standing with Ike Ekweremadu on this. We will not abandon him to this. “Effort is being made by quite a number of Senators to see what we can do by way of giving moral support and any other support that is required. “But we want to get get the full details of the case. The issues are that the victim was not of age, that he was below 18 years old, so he could not be seen to have had the right of determining as to whether he could offer his organs for someone else.”
