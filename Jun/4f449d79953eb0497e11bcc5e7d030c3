Former Juventus defender, Fabio Cannavaro, has given his verdict on Paul Pogba while warning his former side over the re-signing of Manchester United midfielder. Pogba is widely expected to return to Juventus this summer as his contract at Man United will expire at the end of this month. According to Sky Sports, the Old Lady are in the final stages of wrapping up a three-year deal with Pogba. Pogba played for Juventus from 2012 to 2016, growing into one of Europe’s most renowned midfielders in the process. But Cannavaro is hoping Pogba returns to the Old Lady in the form he previously enjoyed in Turin rather than his questionable spell at Man United. “Pogba to Juve? I hope to see the real Paul again, the one from the first Juventus experience. He has to find the reasons,” Cannavaro told Tuttosport (via Metro). “The midfielder of recent seasons is of no use to Juventus or France.” Pogba made 233 appearances for Manchester United, scoring 39 goals and registering 51 assists.
