The Senate on Wednesday passed the Public-Private Partnership Regulatory Commission Bill, 2022. The Chartered Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering of Nigeria (Establishment) Bill, 2022, was also passed. The passage followed the consideration and adoption of separate reports of the Committees on Works and Establishment and Public Service. Sen. Emmanuel Orker-Jev (PDP- Benue) said the Chartered Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering of Nigeria (Establishment) Bill sought to provide the requisite legal and institutional framework for the Institute. It is expected to provide the necessary legal regime for the effective specialisation, standardisation and professionalism of the field of engineering in Nigeria. The Public-Private Partnership Regulatory Commission Bill, 2022, was presented by Sen. Adamu Aliero ((PDP-Kebbi ). The bill seeks to strengthen and enhance the supervisory role of the commission and position it in regulating the participation of the public and private sectors. Speaking on the PPP Bill, Senate President, Ahmad Lawan said Nigeria has so much infrastructural deficit but little resources. “It is important that we diversify our sources of funding of our infrastructural development”, he noted.
