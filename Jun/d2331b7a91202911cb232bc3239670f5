Former Italy and Juventus forward, Alessandro Del Piero has backed Argentina’s Lionel Messi and Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo to win the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. The 2022 FIFA World Cup will start on Monday, November 21, at the Al Thumama Stadium when Senegal takes on the Netherlands in Group A, followed by hosts Qatar against Ecuador at the Al Bayt Stadium. Argentina are in Group C in the 2022 World Cup and will face Mexico, Poland, and Saudi Arabia. Portugal, meanwhile, are in Group H and will face Ghana, Uruguay and Korea. Speaking after Argentina defeated Italy 3-0 in the Finalissima on Wednesday night, Del Piero told ESPN FC’s YouTube channel: “The Euro 2020 proved that when a team comes together, they can do amazing things. And of course, there’s a kind of emotional way to see the last World Cup for Messi. The same thing can happen for Ronaldo. They basically have two very similar teams.” He added: “It’s good that we are going to the last World Cup for these amazing players with a good team that actually can win the tournament because it’s one month. Everything has to be perfect for one month. But you need to start that tournament on the right foot. And I believe both teams, including Argentina, have the right foot to start.”
