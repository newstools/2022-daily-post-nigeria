The Federal Government has launched a probe into the breach of the data privacy of David Nwamini. The young Nigerian was taken to the United Kingdom for alleged organ harvestimg by ex-Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu and wife Beatrice. With the matter in a U.K. court, the passport data page of Nwamini surfaced and circulated online. In a statement, the Nigeria Data Protection Bureau (NDPB) said it was also investigating the breach of the data privacy of Ekweremadu’s daughter, Sonia. National Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer, Vincent Olatunji said the publication of their data was illegal. “The bureau notes with concern that certain sensitive personal data purportedly belonging to the two Nigerian citizens (complainant and patient) in this case are being processed by data controllers”. The agency said the exposure of sensitive details, particularly by media organizations, was being done without regard to the implications. “NDPR prohibits the processing of personal data without the informed consent or other lawful bases known to law”, the statement added. The NDPB warned all data controllers and persons to stop sharing such private data, adding that they may face the consequences of doing so. The Ekweremadus were arraigned at the Uxbridge Magistrate Court in London last week.
