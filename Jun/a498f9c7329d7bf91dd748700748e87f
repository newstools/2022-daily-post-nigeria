Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has accused President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government of actively supporting Fulanis to take over Nigeria. Ortom, who appeared on Arise TV on Wednesday morning, said this while speaking on the insecurity in Benue. He described as barbaric, the gruesome killing of farmers in Edumoga, Okpokwu Local Government Area of the state by gunmen believed to be herdsmen. Recall that more than 24 persons were recently killed in their sleep in Benue communities by suspected Fulani herdsmen The suspected Fulani herdsmen had invaded and killed 8 persons in Mbadwem, Guma Local Government and 16 in Tiortyu, a sprawling settlement in Tarka Local Government, along Makurdi-Gboko road. But Ortom believes the recent attacks in his state by militia Fulani herdsmen have to do with their agenda to take over the entire country. Ortom said, “It is not just about a certain local government area, It is about the entire state, it is about the entire country, Nigeria. “Tell me where else, is it in Zamfara, where the Hausa people live and the Fulanis have decided to take over the land. “Is it in Kaduna, where the indigenous people were either traditionalist or Christians now they have been taken over. “Is it in the South East or in the Middle BeIt where the Fulanis have decided that they are going to take over this country and actively they have been supported by the present government of President Muhammadu Buhari “Like I said, I know they are not happy, we know they are angry. But that is the truth. Even if I am dead, let it be on record just like Martin Luther King of America who stood for the grass and said the truth. I am ready to do it. “This is the truth the Fulanis have made up their mind to take Nigeria as their own country and using Islam as a tool to ensure that they are in control.”
