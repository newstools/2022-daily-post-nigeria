Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta is ‘angry’ at the club’s boards’ indecision in the transfer market and fears they have blown their chances of signing Manchester City striker, Gabriel Jesus, this summer. Arteta spent almost £150 million on the likes of Martin Odegaard, Ben White and Aaron Ramsdale last summer and wants to oversee another spending spree before the 2022-2023 season begins. Arteta’s side endured a mixed 2021-2022 campaign, with a young and inexperienced squad unable to secure a return to the Champions League. However, Arteta wants to sign a new striker, midfielder and defender this summer and has identified Jesus as one of his top targets. The Spaniard worked with Jesus when he was Pep Guardiola’s assistant at Man City and believes he is the man to fill the void left by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette. According to Daily Mail, Arteta fears Arsenal is set to miss out on the Brazilian, who Man City values at £50m, and is growing increasingly frustrated at the club’s transfer strategy. It is claimed that all major transactions at Arsenal must go through their American owners this summer, with indecision over deals potentially costing Arteta his top targets. Recall that Arsenal has been heavily linked with a move to sign Jesus this summer.
