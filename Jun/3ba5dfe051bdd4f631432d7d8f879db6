Alhaji Garba Umar, former acting governor of Taraba State has denied joining the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Umar, who issued the denial in a statement on Friday in Jalingo, said that he did not contemplate leaving the All Progressives Congress (APC) to any other political party. He called on the general public to disregard such rumour, advising the proponents to desist henceforth. He said, “My attention has been drawn to the news going round the social media that I, Alhaji Garba Umar (UTC) have joined the PDP.” Stressing that he is still a staunch member of the ruling party, he said, “I will at best describe the rumour as malicious and a total fallacy emanating from rabble rousers who are hell-bent on maligning my political reputation and integrity.” Urging the rumour peddlers to cease from such acts, he said, “I want to state abundantly clear that I have not contemplated joining any other political party and I remain a loyal member of the APC.”
