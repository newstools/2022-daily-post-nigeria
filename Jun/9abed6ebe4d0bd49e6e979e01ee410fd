Former Leeds United striker, Noel Whelan, has urged Arsenal defender, Nuno Tavares, to leave the club on loan and prove himself elsewhere next season. Whelan believes Tavares had some terrible games last season. Tavares arrived at Arsenal last summer following a £7.2 million transfer from Benfica (per Transfermarkt). He made 28 appearances across the campaign, including 13 Premier League starts. Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, was forced to play Tavares when first-choice left-back Kieran Tierney was struck down with an injury. But the former Portugal U21 international was horribly exposed, and put-in numerous sub-par performances as Arsenal eventually missed out on the top four last season. Speaking about Tavares, Whelan told Football Insider: “Everyone always has an opportunity to come back if they are loaned out. He’s got to show character now and put the performances in to really catch Arteta’s eye. He’s got to go out and prove a point. “It doesn’t surprise me. He’s had good games, but he’s also had terrible games. It’s that inconsistency which has probably forced Arteta’s hand and led him to decide to loan him out. “If he can have a consistent season elsewhere, then he could still be a beneficial asset for Arsenal in the long-term.”
