Ahead of the 2022 gubernatorial election in Osun State, a civil society group in the state, The Osun Masterminds, has called on the political actors in the state to make their campaigns an issue-based one devoid of frivolity and vague promises. The group while addressing journalists in Osogbo, maintained that if the state must progress, those seeking to govern them must tell the public what they intend to do. The group’s Director, Wasiu Oyedokun-Alli while condemning a statement credited to a gubernatorial candidate who said he had loads of pounds and dollars to prosecute his election added that the state deserved to have purposeful governance built on clear developmental ideas, not Naira, Pounds and Dollars. The group which frowned at the vandalisation of campaign billboards of Senator Ademola Adeleke described it as unhealthy for democracy. “We frown at the destruction of campaign billboards and advertisements of opposition political parties in the state, particularly that, of the PDP Governorship candidate, as this, is unhealthy for all-inclusive democratic participation and citizen’s right to choices. “Social vices like these make it impossible for a society to truly grow and we call on all relevant stakeholders to put hands on deck to prevent future occurrences of injustice and criminality.” The group admonished Osun people to participate in the present electoral process to ensure that only persons who guarantee their well-being are voted into office. “This starts from looking out for the candidates that will attend the Governorship debates that will be organized going forward. “To take a candidate seriously, we first must hear them discuss the plans and programmes they have, that may convince us to vote for them. We must also ensure that candidates are offering solutions, not just intangible promises that are neither measurable nor redeemable,” it concluded.
