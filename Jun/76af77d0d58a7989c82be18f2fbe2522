President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the occasion of her Platinum Jubilee. The Head of the Commonwealth of Nations marks her 70th year amid celebrations in the United Kingdom. Buhari noted that the Queen is the first British monarch to reach seven decades on the throne. In his message, the President hailed her milestones including being the youngest ever on the throne, and handling her role with grace. He described the Queen as a loyal, patriotic, and compassionate leader who works for the people, not as a ruler but as a friend and compatriot. “People never lose trust in Queen Elizabeth. Their firm belief is that she always has the potential to deliver, especially during troubled times. “It is confirmation of the fact that Queen Elizabeth always acts and delivers according to people’s expectations”, Buhari said. The Nigerian leader, on behalf of the government and citizens, wishes her more years in excellent condition of health.
