Former Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has opened up on how he will not manage Manchester United. The Frenchman has admitted that he takes the language barrier very seriously, as “I work in a different way”. In an interview with Marca, Zidane said: “Would I want to go to Manchester [United]? I understand English, but I’m not completely fluent in it. “I know that there are coaches who go to clubs without speaking the language, but I work in a different way. Many elements come into play in order to win, it is a global context. I know what I need to win.” Zidane has been out of a job since he left Santiago Bernabeu.
