A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and a university lecturer, Professor Moses Memulanga, Friday, lambasted Bola Ahmed Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), over his comment about making Muhammadu Buhari a President in 2015 DAILY POST recalls that Tinubu, also a presidential candidate, during his campaign tour to Ogun State, on Thursday, said he made Buhari achieve his political ambition in 2015. However, Professor Moses, while reacting in an interview with DAILY POST in Kaduna, noted that Tinubu’s singular vote cannot override million of Nigerians’ votes. According to him, whatever took place between ATinubu and President Buhari in 2015, is an issue of personal friendship and privacy, and should not be used as an excuse for winning or failing in the APC primary elections scheduled for this weekend. “Asiwaju Bola Tinubu’s vote alone, or his intellectual capability alone cannot give Buhari millions of votes. “As friends or colleagues in politics, friendship advice, assistance in whatever form is necessary for the progress of one another, but getting someone to the seat of power by a single individual’s vote, or whatever means, is incredible “Whatever happened during Buhari’s campaign in 2015, is never the concern of Nigerians. Tinubu should settle his issues with Buhari and not come on the pages of newspapers and social media platforms to distract others,” he said. He accused Tinubu of being part of those that contributed to the suffering of Nigerians through banditry and all forms of criminal activities in the country. He said as a friend, who allegedly made Buhari what he is today, it means he contributed to the failure of the APC government, and would also want to succeed Buhari, so he can see the end of Nigerians. According to him, many sufferings, problems, banditry and kidnapping encountered by Nigerians since Buhari came to power, was a result of bad advice, given to him by his friends.
