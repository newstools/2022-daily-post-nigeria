Another missing Chibok girl kidnapped by Boko Haram, Hauwa Joseph has been found. The Nigerian Army (NAN) made the announcement on Thursday. “The intercepted Chibok girl and her baby are currently in a military medical facility”, a terse statement reads. The former captive was found during clearance operations in the North-East on June 14, 2022. Hauwa and her colleagues were abducted on April 14, 2014 from the Government Girls Secondary School in Chibok, Borno State. More than 270 students, mostly minors, were transported into the forest in a convoy of vehicles. While scores have died or been found, it is estimated that at least 100 Chibok are still missing. Earlier in the week, troops of 26 Task Force Brigade on clearance operation at Ngoshe came in contact with one of the girls. Like Hauwa, Mary Dauda, now 27 years old, was found with a child.
