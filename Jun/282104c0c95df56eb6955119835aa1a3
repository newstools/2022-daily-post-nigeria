New Manchester United manager, Erik ten Hag, refused to meet his predecessor Ralf Rangnick in a face-to-face, after his appointment was confirmed. Ten Hag only spoke with Rangnick over the phone, after the German’s spell as interim coach expired at the end of the season. Rangnick eventually left the club, as United confirmed he will not carry on in a consultancy role, as had been originally planned. ESPN reports that plan was scrapped as his relationship with Ten Hag never took off and United signed a non-disclosure agreement with Rangnick upon his departure from the club. It marked a clear break from the Dutchman from his predecessor, whose compulsory role had never been clearly defined by the club. Rangnick is believed to have been unhappy that he was not granted a face-to-face meeting with Ten Hag.
