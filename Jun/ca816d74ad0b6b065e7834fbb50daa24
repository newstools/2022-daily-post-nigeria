Arsenal legend Ray Parlour has hailed the club for bringing Gabriel Jesus to the Emirates Stadium this summer. According to him, the deal is ‘brilliant’ business for the club as well as the player. Parlour said this after Arsenal agreed a deal for the Brazil international, insisting that that is exactly the signing the Gunners need this summer. He said it was a brilliant signing, adding that a striker was the area that they needed to strengthen. The Gunners legend says he is looking forward to seeing how Jesus settles into the Arsenal side. “He will get chances because that’s one thing that Arsenal do well, they create chances with [Martin] Odegaard, [Emile] Smith Rowe, [Gabriel] Martinelli and [Bukayko] Saka from the right, so he will get opportunities,” he said.
