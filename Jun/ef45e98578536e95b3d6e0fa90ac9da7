The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has released names of alleged kidnappers in the South East. This was contained in a statement signed by IPOB’s spokesman, Emma Powerful. The secessionist group dissociated itself from the criminals, saying it had never been part of or behind the ongoing insecurity and criminalities in the region. Powerful also made it clear that the group is working towards exposing those behind the ongoing criminalities in Anambra, Enugu, and Imo states. “In Abia State particularly, a certain Nkechi Kalu and her gang of about eight kidnap members operating between Abia State and Igweocha, Rivers State are not IPOB members, they and their activities should not be associated with ‘IPOB family’ membership. “In Enugu State, a certain group of criminal elements turned themselves into enemies of the people, the names of their gang leaders are as follows; Chocho and Mazi Ejiofor; [they] are not IPOB members and anybody associating with them is a confirmed criminal,” the statement read in part. He added that “the above-named persons who were formerly IPOB members were expelled as a result of indiscipline and insubordination which is not tolerated by IPOB leadership.”
