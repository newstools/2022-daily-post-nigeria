Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, the Chairman of the South West Governors’ Forum and the Governor of Ondo State, has warned that the people of the Southwest will not allow any unprovoked attack on the area under any pretext. While condemning the Owo incident as “one too many,” Akeredolu pointed out that the people of the Southwest have always worked to protect the country’s peace and unity. At the Government House, Alagbaka, Akure, the state capital, the governor stated this while receiving his brother governors from Ogun, Dapo Abiodun; Lagos, Babajide Sanwo-Olu; and Kwara, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq. The governors were in the state to pay Akeredolu a condolence visit following the terror attack at Saint Francis Catholic Church in Owo on June 5, 2022. The governors’ visit, according to Akeredolu, was not only symbolic but also significant, and he thanked his colleagues for their support since the event. Earlier, Prince Dapo Abiodun, the Governor of Ogun State on behalf of the Governors of Lagos and Kwara States, said that the attack was not only on the good people of Owo and Ondo States, but on the entire people of the South-West area. The governors will further consolidate and improve the zone’s security architecture.
