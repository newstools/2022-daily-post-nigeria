Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, has boasted of victory in the coming July 16 governorship election, saying defeat is never an option for him in the contest. Oyetola said that various efforts his administration had put into the development of the state would make the victory at the poll a landslide one. He said this while addressing members of Nigerian Incorporated Electronic Practitioners, Osun State Chapter during an engagement meeting organised by the Civic Engagement Office on Sunday in Osogbo. Oyetola, who was represented at the meeting by his Special Adviser on Civic Engagement, Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, noted that the alleged campaign of calumny by the opposition parties against his administration would not stop his victory. Oyetola said that the landslide victory recorded by the All Progressives Congress for its candidate in Ekiti governorship election would be replicated in the July 16 election in the state. “For me, defeat is not an option in the coming election. The victory that will be recorded in the election through the popular votes of the electorate for me and APC , will surpass that of Ekiti State. “We are prepared for the election and it will not be out of place to extend hands of fellowship to everyone to join us in moving the state forward. “I want to emphasise that failure is not an option, but victory is certain by the grace of God”, he said. Oyetola also assured the electorate that he would not let them down during his second term in office, adding that his mission in politics was service to humanity. He said the laudable achievements his administration had achieved in all sectors in the state would be consolidated on, when reelected. The governor said his tireless efforts to improve workers’ welfare, the economy, education, agriculture, youth empowerment, among others would be sustained. The governor, however, urged the electorate to get their Permanent Voter Cards (PVC) to support him in the coming election.
