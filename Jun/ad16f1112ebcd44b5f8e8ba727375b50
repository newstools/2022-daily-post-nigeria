Germany has said it would train Ukrainian soldiers up on the Multiple Launch Rocket System Mars II. Germany’s defence minister Christine Lambrecht said this at the Geman parliament, Wednesday, according to CNN. Lambrecht said the training to be conducted in Germany could start as early as next week. She added that once those instructions have been concluded, delivery of the weapons system could start. Germany would deliver three such systems to Ukraine, with the UK matching that number, and the US would deliver four Multiple Rocket Launch Systems (MLRS), she added.
