Pastor Tunde Bakare, the General Overseer of Citadel Global Community Church, has spoken for the first time, since he recorded no single vote during the just-concluded presidential primary of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC. A former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, emerged the party’s flag bearer after polling 1,271 votes. Bakare was one of the aspirants who paid N100million to purchase the presidential form and has praised himself for his conduct during the election. According to the cleric, he is delighted with the character he showed. ”I am happy that I have passed the test of character by not paying any delegate. I passed the test of courage, by speaking the truth in the midst of wolves and the test of conviction by standing true to my beliefs. “Those who will make a difference must be different,“ Bakare was quoted by The Nation.
