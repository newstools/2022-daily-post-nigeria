Chelsea are very close to beating Paris Saint-Germain to complete the signing of 25-year-old Barcelona star, Ousmane Dembele. According to a report from TMW (as per 10 Sport), Dembele is close to joining Chelsea on a free transfer this summer despite interest from PSG. The report added that Dembele has decided that he would like to join Chelsea as he is keen to reunite with his former coach Thomas Tuchel at Stamford Bridge. Tuchel managed the 2018 World Cup winner during their time together at Dortmund. Dembele will choose the Blues over a return to France, despite PSG offering him a very good contract. The winger has failed to live up to expectations since his mega-money move to Barcelona in 2017 from Borussia Dortmund. Injuries and behavioural issues have severely hindered Dembele’s progress at Camp Nou. Dembele has scored 32 goals in 150 appearances for the Blaugrana, but looks set to leave the Catalan club this summer when his contract expires.
