The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has advised Tinubu to consult the ‘Noble Dozen’, before picking a running mate for the 2023 presidential election. Tinubu became the flagbearer of the All Progressives Congress, APC, after he became victorious in the party’s presidential primaries at Eagles Square, Abuja on Wednesday. The Islamic group explained that ‘Noble Dozen’ is the name it gave to the twelve Northern governors who insisted that the South should be given the opportunity to produce President Muhammadu Buhari’s successor. MURIC made the suggestion in a statement signed by its director, Prof. Ishaq Akintola, on Saturday. “We will like to advise that apart from ensuring that the position of vice president in 2023 goes to the North, Senator Tinubu should consult the ‘Noble Dozen’,” the group said. “Those we refer to as the Noble Dozen are those twelve (12) sincere Northern governors who disabused the minds of Nigerians concerning the myth of Northern hegemony and a nonexistent caliphate oligarchy by insisting that APC’s presidential candidate must come from the South. This was a great sacrifice and a noble idea. “They demonstrated statesmanship, patriotism and nobility of thought by that action. “
