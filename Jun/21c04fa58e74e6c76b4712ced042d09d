Nicholas Felix, a presidential aspirant of All Progressives Congress (APC), has stepped down for the Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. He confirmed this while making his speech at the party’s special convention on Tuesday night. According to him, APC “must not produce a Muslim-Muslim” ticket. Felix then urged his delegates to join him in voting Osinbajo. He becomes the first aspirant to step down for Osinbajo. At least six presidential hopefuls including Governor Kayode Fayemi, Godswill Akpabio, Dimeji Bankole have stepped down for Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, the National Leader of the APC.
