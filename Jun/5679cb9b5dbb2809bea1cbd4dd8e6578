Former Minister of Labour and Productivity, Senator Joel Danlami Ikenya, has dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Ikenya, who was among the numerous governorship aspirants in the just-concluded primaries of the PDP, resigned from the party on Monday. The former minister said his decision was based “on personal grounds.” DAILY POST, however, gathered that the way and manner the primaries, especially that of the governorship were conducted, which did not go down well with him, compelled him to take a bow out of the party. His resignation, as observed by DAILY POST, is coming barely few hours after the state chapter of the party inaugurated a 17-man committee to reconcile all the aggrieved members of the party, especially the aspirants. A source, who believed that the exit of Ikenya would no doubt tell negatively on the party in the next general election, said “our greatest mistake was our failure to create a level play ground for all the aspirants.” Citing some of the aggrieved governorship aspirants that have dragged the party to court, the party, according to him “will soon witness mass defections of its members to opposition parties.” Though at the time of filing this report, Ikenya has not announced his next line of action, our correspondent, however, gathered that the politician is already in talk with chieftains of some of the opposition parties.
