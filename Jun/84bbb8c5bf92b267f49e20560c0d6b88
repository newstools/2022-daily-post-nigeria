A public commentator, Chima Christian, has blamed the insecurity in the South-East on the political leadership. In a statement, Christian said the challenge was “both foreseeable and preventable”, but the leadership failed to act timely. The pundit maintained that Abuja-controlled security resources became lethargic and unresponsive to the security demands of the country. “This included the Southeast which had an often exaggerated but potent threat of terrorists masquerading as herdsmen.” Citing Benue, he said with the overrun by terrorists and the accusations of Federal Government’s duplicity by the state government, the South-East should have long put a homegrown security outfit in place. “While the Southwest responded with Amotekun, as imperfect as it is, Southeast political power players did not show as much commitment and decisiveness.” Separatists, he continued, saw an opportunity to plant themselves as that credible alternative given the reaction of the region’s East political leadership. “People like us forewarned that such amorphous non-state actors who are not accountable nor can indeed be held to account is an uncontrollable experiment.” Christian lamented how armed agitators and other mutants whose activities inspire, instead of becoming the promised solution, became the biggest security threat. He added that those pushing anti-establishment rhetoric in the pursuit of their political agenda must take some form of responsibility for what is happening in the South-East.
