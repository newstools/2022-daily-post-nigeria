The Lagos State Police Command has arrested two notorious robbery suspects alleged to have been attacking motorists around Deeper Life Bible Church Bridge in Gbagada. The spokesperson for the Command, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, confirming their arrest in a statement in Lagos, said a manhunt was launched for them after the command received credible information. “The suspects were arrested by operatives on routine patrol following credible information received about the presence of suspicious persons on Deeper Life Bible Church Bridge, Gbagada. “However, the third suspect took to his heels upon sighting the policemen,” he said. Hundeyin said that the suspects had been operating in the area during traffic gridlocks, distracting motorists and carting away their phones and other belongings. He noted that the suspects in its custody are helping the police in an ongoing investigation to arrest the third suspect and other members of their gang. Hundeyin added that the suspects would be arraigned in court as soon as investigation was concluded, even as he urged the public to report unusual behavior around their surroundings.
