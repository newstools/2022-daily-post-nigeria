Former lawmaker, Senator Shehu Sani, has compared Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, to Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State as the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, picks a running mate of the party’s 2023 presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. Sani said Okowa played a key role in the victory of Atiku at the PDP’s primary recently conducted, while Wike is so committed to sustaining the party. He disclosed this in a tweet via his Twitter handle on Thursday. Sani tweeted: “Okowa played a key role in the victory of Atiku at the primaries and he is a cross between the South East and the South-South. “Wike strongly emerged second, committed so much in sustaining the party and his ruggedness is an asset in the battle when it turns dirty. Any can be VP.” DAILY POST reports that the PDP, will, in the next few hours, announce Okowa as the running mate of the party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar.
