A former Niger Delta militant leader, Asari Dokubo, has said his loyalty to former President Goodluck Jonathan made him cut communications with the All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu. Dokubo said he also cut ties with Rauf Aregbesola, the Minister of Interior; President Muhammadu Buhari, and other APC members due to his loyalty to Jonathan. The former militant warlord disclosed this during a Facebook Live on Thursday. According to Dokubo: “I cut off communication with Tinubu because of Goodluck in 2014. “I was in Mecca for Hajj, with the present Minister for Interior, Rauf Aregbesola. I went to his hotel room to see him, that was in 2013, and he said, ‘why are you following Goodluck’? He said Goodluck would not do you anything good. He said, ‘why don’t you stay where you are celebrated?’ “All of us celebrate you. And I told him I cannot betray my people. I stood by Goodluck and cut off friendships with Rauf Aregbesola, Adams Oshiomhole, Kayode Fayemi, Tinubu himself, and even President Buhari. “Tinubu wanted me to be in politics; I did not. I sacrificed those relationships for my people, and I’m not regretting it.”
