Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder, Jamie O’Hara has told Arsenal that he might delete his Twitter account if they sign Raphinha from Premier League club, Leeds United. Arsenal have been strongly linked with a move for the 25-year-old winger and O’Hara insists that he has been impressed with their transfer activities so far this summer. The 35-year-old, who was speaking to talkSPORT, also praised Arsenal’s capture of Gabriel Jesus. He said, “Gabriel Jesus would be a top signing, I have always been impressed by him. “And if they get Raphinha as well, then I might delete Twitter.” Raphinha has emerged as a key player at Leeds since joining the club from Rennes in 2020. The Brazil international has scored 17 goals and provided 11 assists in 66 matches in all competitions for Leeds.
