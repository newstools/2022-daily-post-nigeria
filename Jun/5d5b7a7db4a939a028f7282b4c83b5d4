Bayern Munich striker, Robert Lewandowski wants a move to Barcelona this summer transfer window despite interest from Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain, according to football transfer expert, Fabrizio Romano. Romano disclosed this in a tweet via his Twitter handle on Friday. He tweeted: “Barcelona are preparing their new official bid for Robert Lewandowski. Laporta’s great relationship with his agent Zahavi helped to wait and keep a valid verbal agreement on personal terms. “Lewandowski’s priority has always been Barça, despite Chelsea and PSG approaches.” Meanwhile, Lewandowski, 33, has enjoyed great success in his eight-year spell at Bayern Munich, recording a staggering 344 goals in 375 appearances for the German giants. He won eight Bundesliga titles, three DFB-Pokals and the UEFA Champions League. The 2021 FIFA World Best player has also swept up a host of individual accolades in that time, narrowly missing out on last year’s Ballon d’Or award to Paris Saint-Germain’s Lionel Messi in controversial fashion after netting 42 goals in 2021. But after adding another Bundesliga title to his collection last month, the Poland international recently announced his intention to leave Bayern and embark on a new challenge this summer. “My era at Bayern is over,” Lewandowksi said. I don’t see any possibility to continue playing for this club anymore.” Lewandowski has just 12 months to run on his current contract.
