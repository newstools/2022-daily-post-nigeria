The Niger State chapter of Young Progressives Party, YPP, has affirmed Malam Umar Larat Aliyu as its governorship candidate for the 2023 governorship election in the state. Affirming his candidature at the party office in Minna, the state party chairman, Zakariyah Adam Mohammed, said Aliyu was considered as a sole candidate due to his track record. He stated, “Larat Aliyu is a competent, trustworthy, credible, honest and experienced individual that has the people and the state at heart. And, if elected as the governor of Niger state come 2023, he will bring development to the state.” In his response, Malam Umar Larat Aliyu assured the party to use his wealth of experience to change the narrative in governance when given the opportunity to serve the state. Aliyu noted, “I am not unaware of the challenges facing the state which include insecurity, decayed educational and health sectors, neglect in agriculture, poor Internally Generated Revenue, IGR, and coupled with large scale of unemployment. That is why we need to change the trends positively.” The governorship candidate also decried the recent money politics engaged by aspirants in Niger state and across Nigeria in order to clinch party tickets, adding that leadership is a responsibility that can be bought. He, however, charged the electorates to be conscious of such candidates who do not have the people at heart and should not be voted for in the 2023 elections.
