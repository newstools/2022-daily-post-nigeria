Former Barcelona coach, Ronald Koeman, has taken a swipe at the club’s manager Xavi’s 4-3-3 system at Camp Nou, insisting that the Blaugrana live in the past. Koeman also offered his take on Barcelona, potentially signing Bayern Munich’s Robert Lewandowski this summer. The Dutchman, who was sacked by Barcelona last October following a run of poor results and accusations of not using the club’s famous tiki-taka system, told Esport3: “I’m in favour of dominating the game. “Barca lives in the past, from 4-3-3, from ‘tiki-taka’. Football has changed. Now it’s faster, more physical. You can’t live in the past.” He added, “Lewandowski is a great player, a regular goalscorer, but he is of a certain age. “35 years old? I would’ve many doubts about signing him or not signing him.”
