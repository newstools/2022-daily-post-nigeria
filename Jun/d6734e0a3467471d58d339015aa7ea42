Manchester United forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, has revealed that the new manager, Erik ten Hag needs time and the things he wants to succeed at Old Trafford. Ronaldo also said that he is “still very happy” at Old Trafford and wants success under Ten Hag. Ten Hag was appointed Man United’s new manager last month, replacing Ralf Rangnick. “I knew he did a fantastic job for Ajax and that he is an experienced coach but we need to give him time and things need to change the way he wants,” the Portugal captain said in a video posted on the club’s Twitter account. “I hope we have success of course because if you have success, all of Manchester are going to have success as well. So I wish him the best. “We are happy and excited – not only the players, but the supporters as well. “I wish him the best and let’s believe that next year we are going to win trophies. “For me, the most important thing is to try to win the games and try to win some championship or some cup but I believe that Manchester will be where they belong. “As I say before, sometimes it takes time but I still believe.”
