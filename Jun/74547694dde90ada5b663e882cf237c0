Unknown gunmen on Wednesday abducted Ebonyi Government House Cameraman, Mr Uchenna Nwube. He was abducted by suspected kidnappers on Okigwe-Aba-Enugu Expressway on Wednesday. Nwube, who was allowed access to his phone by the kidnappers, told newsmen that he was kidnapped on Wednesday at about 7 p.m and his abductors are asking for N50 million. “I was kidnapped today, June 8 while returning to Abakaliki from Aba and I had some people in my car. “Right now, they (kidnappers) are demanding N50 million as ransom, which I do not know how and when I can get such money. Please, I need help,” he told fellow journalists over the phone. But when NAN contacted the spokesman of the Ebonyi State Police Command, SP Chris Anyanwu, advised the victim to be calm with his abductors. He added that the area where the incident occurred is not within the command’s jurisdiction. He said, ”That place is between Imo and Abia.”
