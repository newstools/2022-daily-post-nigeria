The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) has given the reason for the resurfacing fuel queues in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and parts of the country. IPMAN blamed the inadequate supply of petrol from the depots in Lagos for the scarcity. Mr Chinedu Okoronkwo, IPMAN President, who made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday was reacting to the resurfacing fuel queues in some parts of the country, especially in Abuja. Okoronkwo explained that the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine had disrupted the smooth distribution of petrol and marketers and transporters are finding it difficult to bridge products to other parts of the country from the depots. He said: “The huge amount spent in running the diesel trucks to transport fuel is very discouraging because we are running at a loss. “The current N165 per litre pump price for PMS cannot fit into the present realities without the pricing template being reviewed.” He, therefore, appealed to the Buhari-led government to look into the situation by providing palliatives to all marketers to restore normalcy to distribution or review the freight rate. “The palliative can be making diesel accessible for marketers at discounted rates so that we can easily transport products across the country,” he said.
