Anambra State Police Command has commended indigenes of the state for coming out with information on criminals in their localities. The Command through its spokesperson, DSP Toochukwu Ikenga said information by indigenes has helped the command burst many criminal syndicates in the last one weeks, and also taken out many criminal elements. Ikenga during a chat with DAILY POST said: “You know that last week when you people came for a press conference, the CP (Echeng Echeng) had complained about the reluctance of most communities to come out with information on criminals, who have been code-named unknown gunmen. “The CP had complained that there seemed to be a conspiracy of silence among most indigenes but I can tell you that after those reports, many indigenes have now started volunteering information to us. “Within one week, we have gotten information that we never knew existed. We have also heard a lot of stories from people, and we have used that information to burst many criminal syndicates.” Ikenga thanked the media for the role it is playing, saying that a lot of criminal suspects have been arrested, including native doctors who fortify the criminals. He promised that soon, more stories of the arrest of criminals will be made available to the media as suspects were still being interrogated. Speaking on the recent arrest of a native doctor, Ikenga said the suspect has made a lot of useful information and would be paraded soon, with many others. He also added that soon, the reign of criminals will be over, calling on more indigenes to come up with information, including the camping of criminals in any part of the state.
