Former Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lieutenant General Tukur Yusufu Buratai (rtd), on Saturday in Kaduna has stated that insecurity can only be solved by adopting both kinetic and non-kinetic measures like dialogue and local manufacturing of military equipment. Gen. Buratai, while delivering a lecture titled, “Politics and Insecurity In Nigeria: Way Forward” at a one-day symposium on national security at the Arewa House, Kaduna, further said non-kinetic approaches should include negotiation, dialogue are integrated approaches that can end insecurity through involving traditional and religious leaders, media, security, and intelligence agencies. He said the public needs to be constantly sensitised on roles they must play to end insecurity as key stakeholders. He added that revitalisation of Defense Industries Corporation of Nigeria (DICON), better welfare and equipment for police, as well as the establishment of a national border force like is done in other parts of the world. He advised that the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) should collaborate and employ all means to block off supplies to terrorists, adding that ungoverned spaces should be covered by states and local government areas to prevent insurgents and bandits from moving around freely. He further enlightened that fighters are always in the bush even if the military eliminates their leaders and others, they will continue to recruit, just as he stated that the issue of dialogue is very important. “If you eliminate those in the bush, what of their political leaders and their recruiting agents?” He asked rhetorically. Buratai who strongly aligns with the approach being promoted by a revered Islamic cleric, Sheikh Gumi, further added that “this is where I commend Sheikh Gumi for his initiative. One-third of the fight is military, others should be non-kinetic, through dialogue. We must get this solution and this is the right time to get it done.”
