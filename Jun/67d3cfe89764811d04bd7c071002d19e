The Leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, on Thursday, warned the All Progressives Congress, APC, over the ongoing strike embarked on by the Academic Staff Union of Nigerian Universities, ASUU. Primate Ayodele warned that the ASUU strike may affect the chances of APC retaining power in 2023. In a statement by his spokesman, Oluwatosin Osho, the clergyman said Nigerians would vote against APC if the ASUU strike continues. He also berated the Federal Government over the harsh economic conditions of the country. Primate Ayodele said the strike is affecting the economy of Nigeria negatively while asking the government to meet the demands of the lecturers because they deserve it. According to Ayodele: “This government has been disappointing with the way they are handling ASUU Strike, and this is affecting the Nigerian economy negatively. “When there is no school, how do you want the economy to grow? It’s impossible. “ASUU deserves what they request for; the government should do the needful, the strike is part of Nigeria’s economic crisis, and it’s really sad that they are unable to resolve it. “If things continue this way, the victory of the ruling party will be affected in 2023; people will vote against them massively.”
