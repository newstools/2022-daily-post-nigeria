Gunmen who abducted a retired Chief Pharmacist with the Ekiti Ministry of Health, Mr Israel Bamisaye, have contacted his family, demanding N40 million ransom to release the retiree. Bamisaye was said to have been kidnapped on Wednesday by seven gun-wielding men along his farm located between Ero Dam and the Ekiti State farm settlement located at Orin Ekiti, Ido-Osi local government area of the state. The development ignited tension and panic in the town, with residents trooping out in protest to raise doubt about their safety. A source close to the victim’s family informed newsmen that the gunmen contacted his relatives on Thursday morning demanding for the ransom before they could release him. The source said, “Yes, I can confirm to you that the family received a call at about 10am from the kidnappers, first to demand N50 million but after so much persuasion and pleading they reduced it to N40 million as of Thursday morning and they are threatening to kill the victim if the money is not paid. “Everyone is confused in the community at the moment because of the activities of the gunmen in the farm settlement. “How will the family raise N40 million to pay them now ? This is a serious issue.” But when contacted, the Corps Commandant, Ekiti State Amotekun Corps, denied knowledge of the ransom being demanded by the kidnappers adding that men of the corps and other security agencies are on the trail of the gunmen in a bid to rescue the victim unhurt.
