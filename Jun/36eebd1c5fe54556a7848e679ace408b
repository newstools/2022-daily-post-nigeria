Muslim stakeholders in Offa and Oyun Local Government Areas of Kwara State, have called for the arrest and prosecution of the masterminds of the recent hijab violence at Oyun Baptist Secondary School, Ijagbo. The call is coming on the heels of the continued alleged threat to Muslim school girls who wear the hijab dress code to school by agents of the church in the school since the reopening of the school by the state government. At a press conference in Ilorin, the Muslim stakeholders also asked the state government to release the white paper of the probe panel set up on the crisis which led to the killing of one person, identified as Habeeb Idris, while scores were seriously injured. Commending the state government’s efforts to ensure peace prevails in the school, they said ” we hereby call on the government as the employer of those staff members to call them to order to avert another unnecessary crisis and breakdown of law and order. ” The government, should adequately compensate the family of Habeeb Idris and settle all the medical and other expenses of the other injured victims in the crisis.” They further asked the government and its agencies on education to warn and monitor the staff of the affected school from intimidating the Muslim school girls that wear the hijab dress code.
