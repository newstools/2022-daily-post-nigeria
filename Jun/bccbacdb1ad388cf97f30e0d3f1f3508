President Muhammadu Buhari has restated Nigeria’s commitment for a safer and healthier global climate. He said measures include the elimination of kerosene lighting by 2030, increase in use of buses for public transport and reduction in burning of crop residues. Buhari spoke on Friday during a virtual meeting, hosted by United States President Joe Biden. The party was the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate Change (MEF). The Nigerian leader recalled that the updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change was submitted to replace the interim contribution of May 27, 2021. Buhari said it covers the waste sector which would contribute to the reduction of Nigeria’s Greenhouse Gas emissions. He confirmed that the government lowered the NDC from 45 percent to 47 percent conditionally, and 20 percent unconditionally below business-as-usual. Buhari said Nigeria is also seeking to deliver 20 percent GreenHouse Gas emission reductions and enhanced removals equivalent to approximately 74.2 Metric tons of Carbon Dioxide by 2030. The President further mentioned ratification of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase out Hydro-fluoro-carbon emissions. Buhari said his administration approved Nigeria’s Sustainable Energy for All Action Agenda in 2016, which has a target of almost tripling generation capacity in the next decade, to reach a total of 30 Gigawatt by 2030. Thirty percent is expected to be generated from renewable resources, with almost half of this provided by medium and large hydro. “The Clean Energy Transport Scheme in major Nigerian cities involves the introduction of compressed natural gas for buses in public transport. “Nigeria is aware that its heavy dependence on fossil fuel makes the country vulnerable in a world that has a target to reduce or even eliminate fossil fuel”, he added.
