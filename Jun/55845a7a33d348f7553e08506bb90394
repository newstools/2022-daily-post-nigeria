The Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has denied he will leave the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Wike, in a statement signed by his media aide, Kelvin Ebiri, was reacting to a viral video which claimed the governor was threatening to defect to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). In a statement released on Wednesday night, Ebiri insisted the video was intended to mislead members of the public. Ebiri explained that the video was an excerpt of an old interview that Wike granted while reacting to the defection of the Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, from the PDP to the APC. “Governor Wike has repeatedly maintained that he will never, under any circumstances, defect from the PDP, which has offered him the platform to excel in his political career. “We urge the public to ignore the distorted video. Those behind it are desperately wicked and intend to mislead the public. Governor Wike remains a faithful, committed member of the PDP and will never leave it for the cancerous APC,” the statement read in part. Wike is believed to be one of the candidates being considered by the presidential candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar, as a running mate for next year’s election.
