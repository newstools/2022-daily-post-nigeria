Real Valladolid president, Ronaldo Nazario is hoping to bring two big names to the club this summer. Ronaldo, a former Real Madrid and Barcelona star, wants Marcelo and Dani Alves, his Brazilian countrymen, with him at the club. Ronaldo will build on the good relationship he has with the two players to try to lure them to the newly-promoted LaLiga Santander side. Brazilian media outlet, UOL Esporte reports that the former Brazil international is looking for the two full-backs to give the club a publicity boost. It also reports that paying the players is not a problem for the club, even as it won’t be an easy task to bring either of the superstars to the club. Both are looking to reach Qatar 2022 and play for Brazil. Maecelo left Real Madrid last season, ending his 16-year spell with the Spanish giants and becoming the player with the most titles won with the club. And Serie A side, AC Milan are leading the race to sign the 33-year-old Brazil international this summer. Alves, who left Barcelona after a second spell with the Blaugrana, is also wanted by several teams.
