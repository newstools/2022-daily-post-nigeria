The Nasir El-Rufai-led Kaduna State Government has come under scrutiny for sacking 2,357 teachers in the state. The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, carpeted the state government, describing the decision as vindictive, illegal and absolutely wicked. The sacked teachers included the National President of Nigerian Union of Teachers (NUT) Audu Amba, who was dismissed for allegedly refusing to sit for the competency test. The compulsory test was put together by the Kadim Universal Basic Education Board (KADSUBEB). HURIWA backed Ibrahim Dalhatu, Chairman of the State’s NUT, who earlier described the sacking of teachers as illegal. The rights group said the decision to sack teachers in the state contravenes Section 42 of the Constitution, because, according to the group, “the governor being an employee of the voters in Kaduna State and his appointees are not subjected to such competency test thereby making the policy discriminatory. HURIWA’S position was endorsed by the National Coordinator Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko in a statement issued on Monday. DAILY POST reported earlier that the education board was said to have conducted a competency test for over 30,000 teachers in December, 2021 and afterward, 2,192 were dismissed.
