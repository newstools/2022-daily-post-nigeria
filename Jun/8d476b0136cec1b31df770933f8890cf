The Kogi State Government has warned against extortion of applicants in the ongoing teachers’ recruitment in the state. The Kogi State Chairman, Teaching Service Commission, STETSCOM, Cecilia Cook gave the warning in a statement on Tuesday. Cook said it has come to the notice of the commission that, some unscrupulous elements have been taking advantage of innocent applicants to extort money in the name of helping them to seek employment. She said, “To set the record straight, STETSCOM under my watch is not requesting money for the application of suitably qualified candidates to fill vacancies in our schools. “This is against the ideals of the New Direction administration of Governor Yahaya Bello as the exercise is purely free of charge. “Anyone that gives money to either staff of the Commission or fraudsters are only doing so on their own risk as I am not a party to that. If you have given money to anyone, go and collect your money or report them to any security agencies close to you.” She reiterated that the employment exercise will be transparent and fair as it is geared towards repositioning secondary education in the state.
