Nigerian music star, Tems has reacted to receiving best international act at BET 2022 awards. Tems defeated Fireboy, Dave Dinos from France, Fally Ipupa from Congo, Little Simz from the UK, Ludmilla from Brazil, Tayo (France) and Major League Djz from South Africa to win the award. Receiving the award, Tems, who was present at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles, on Sunday night, dedicated it to every single woman, especially in Nigeria who may not believe they could chase their dreams. She said: “Thank you so much for this, thank you so much. It is an honour, this is my first award show that I’m winning something and I just want to use this as an opportunity to speak to every single young, old, whatever, every single woman watching this, every single girl watching this at home. “Where I am from, things like this don’t happen.” Meanwhile, Wizkid and Tems won best collaboration for ‘Essence’ featuring Justin Bieber.
