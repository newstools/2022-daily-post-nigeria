Four farmers have been kidnapped by kidnappers in Elegbeka community of Ondo State’s Ose Local Government Area. The abduction of three farmers, one man, and one woman, happened exactly a week after the killing of scores of parishioners at Saint Francis Catholic Church, Owo, the seat of Owo Local Government Area. According to sources, the farmers were on their way to Akoko axis of the state when they were waylaid and abducted by gunmen. It was gathered that the abductors had called the victims’ relatives and demanded N4 million ransom for each of them. Following the kidnapping, local hunters and some herders were said to have exchanged gunfire near Idogun in the Irekari axis inside a forest on the Ondo/Kogi/Edo State borders. The hunters were alleged to have been joined by their counterparts from the communities of Idoani, Ipesi, and Ifira. The Owo terror incident, according to a traditional ruler in the axis, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, has reignited calls for stakeholders to swiftly find answers to the challenge of insecurity in Yoruba land. When contacted, the state’s Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, SP Fumilayo Odunlami, stated she had not yet received any information over the incident.
