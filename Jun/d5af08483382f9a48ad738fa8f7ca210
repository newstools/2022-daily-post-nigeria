Femi Fani-Kayode has replied those attacking him for supporting the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu. The former Aviation Minister also threatened to dump the ruling party if a “dangerous” Muslim is picked as Tinubu’s running mate. In a statement on Thursday, he said no matter what transpired before, the former Lagos Governor is now the democratically-elected candidate of the party he belongs. The ex-presidential aide asked if critics wanted him to fold his arms and say nothing Tinubu while the APC are being dragged. Fani-Kayode noted that party loyalty is everything and until he changes platform, he will remain loyal to and support all flagbearers. “Leave me alone to make my choices just as you have made yours. Follow whoever you believe in all the way to the toilet and let me follow Jagaban to victory. “If Jagaban or APC does something wrong tomorrow or fields a Muslim/Muslim ticket with a Muslim VP that I regard as being a danger to Christians, I will leave them and fight against them. “This much I assure you because I do not shy away from such things especially when it comes to matters touching and concerning my faith. ‘’However if they field a Muslim/Christian ticket or a Muslim/Muslim ticket with a Muslim VP that is moderate and trustworthy and that I am sure will protect Christians and national interest, I will support them with every fiber of my being. “It is as simple as that. I make my choices and you can make yours after which we will meet in the field. I don’t care what choices you make so why should you care about mine?”, he quipped.
