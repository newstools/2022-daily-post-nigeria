Kogi State Governor and a presidential aspirant under the All Progressives Congress, APC, Yahaya Bello, has explained why former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode is not on his campaign team. There were rumours that Fani-Kayode, who had, on more than one occasion, declared his support for Yahaya Bello, has left him to his lofty ambition. There are claims that the former minister and erstwhile chieftain of the main opposition political party, has withdrawn his support for Bello and feels that the next President should come from the South. But speaking during Channels Television’s Sunday Politics, Bello said that Fani-Kayode has never been part of his campaign structure, insisting that the former Minister still believes in him to grab the APC’s sole presidential ticket. “Fani-Kayode is not part of my campaign structure. He’s a friend of mine. He’s an associate and acquaintance. He’s somebody that respects me so highly and I respect him so highly,” he said. “We have been dealing, we have been relating. As I speak to you, yesterday he was with me, today we’ll be together again. “He’s always been with me and supports my political surgeon and is still with me till tomorrow. He is a friend and has never been in my campaign.”
