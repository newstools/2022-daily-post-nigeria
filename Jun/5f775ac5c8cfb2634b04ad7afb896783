Several houses and shops were razed when a petrol-laden tanker caught fire on Sunday in Lokoja,the Kogi State capital. Eye witness account told our correspondent that the Tanker was about negotiating a bend along Ganaja/Ajaokuta road in Lokoja, when it fell on its side, leading to the spillage of its content while residents took advantage to flock the scene to scoop products. Our correspondent gathered that one of the shop owners along the road might have lite a cigarette which ignited the fire. The incident led to the blockade of the road while frantic efforts were on by the fire fighters to put off the fire. However, no life has been lost as at the time of filling this report. Efforts to get to the public relations officer if the Kogi state police command, SP William Aya, proved abortive as several calls to his phone were no answered. He has also not responded to a message sent to him for his comments over the incident.
