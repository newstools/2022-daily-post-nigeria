Medical doctors in the South West geopolitical zone have demanded the immediate arrest of the gunmen, who massacred many worshippers at the St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo, Ondo State on Sunday. While condemning the attack on the church, the medical personnel begged their members in Ondo and neighbouring states to provide the needed health care services for injured victims of the attack. In a statement issued at their South West emergency meeting, the medical practitioners, under the aegis of the Nigerian Medical Association, South-West Zone, regretted that such incidents had become “recurrent with no proactive measures to tackle the ugly trend.” According to the statement jointly signed by the Zonal Caucus Chairman, Dr Ogunlaja Oladayo and the Caucus Secretary, Dr Bolaji Salako, the Doctors sympathized with government and people of Ondo State, asking that efforts should be geared towards putting an end to terrorism across the nation. Saying they received the news of the Owo massacre with great shock, the Doctors called on the government and the security apparatus to swing into action and fish out “these unscrupulous elements” in our community. “We wish the families of the deceased the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss and speedy recovery to the injured. “We call on our members in Ondo and neighbouring states to continue to provide the needed health care service,” it said.
