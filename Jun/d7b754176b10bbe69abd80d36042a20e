Former Manchester United’s star, Louis Saha, has warned that the club must sign players who can improve the ‘core of their team’ like they did with signing of ‘very special’ Bruno Fernandes, if they are to make progress next season. The just-concluded season was a difficult one for the Red Devils with Ralf Rangnick’s side finishing sixth in the league table and going a fifth successive year without a trophy. Now the new manager Erik ten Hag was brought in from Ajax to help the club turn the club’s fortunes around. Saha, the former United striker, thinks Ten Hag should target new signings who can make an instant impact. The former France international believes that from the defence to the striker position has to be built with full confidence. So, for this reason, the manager should “buy competition. Have players who can hit the ground straight away. “We had a very special signing with Bruno Fernandes. That’s the type of calibre the team needs. “I think at the moment the biggest signing is the manager. He needs to feel confident he can make an impact and signings would make a difference.” About ten players will be leaving Old Trafford this season with the likes of Nemanja Matic, Paul Pogba, Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard already confirmed their departures. The Red Devils are closing in on Barcelona’s Frenkie de Jong.
