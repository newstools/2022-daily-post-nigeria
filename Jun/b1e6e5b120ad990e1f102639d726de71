The House of Representatives has asked the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria to accept medical and dental certificates from war-torn Ukraine. The resolution followed a motion moved by Tajudeen Yusuf from Kogi State on Tuesday during plenary. DAILY POST reported that MDCN had announced that it will not accept certificates from Ukraine with effect from 2022 until normalcy is restored in the country. MDCN said the adoption of online classes is not acceptable for medical and dental students. In his motion, Yusuf accused the MDCN of not considering other pragmatic options before arriving at the decision. He said the policy will truncate the training of students and lead to waste of the resources of their sponsors. “The MDCN intends to truncate the academic dreams and professional ambitions of thousands of Nigerian medical students in Ukraine as a result of ongoing development that are not caused by them,” he said. Therefore, the House resolved as follow; “That MDCN should allow students in the 6th (and final) year of their programmes, that have completed their final exams, to register for the MDCN in Nigeria and allow them to prove themselves. “Urged the MDCN to allow students in the 5th year of their medical programmes in Ukraine to be absorbed into Medical Schools in Nigerian Universities to complete their 6th year. “Urged that Federal Government to through relevant MDAs, to discuss with Ukrainian authorities for universities to release the transcripts of years completed from year 1 to Year 6 (as applicable) for Nigerian students willing to Transfer to medical schools in Nigeria or other nations.”
