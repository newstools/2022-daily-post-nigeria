The remains of Cyril Chiegboka, an aide to Anambra State lawmaker, Hon Okey, who was beheaded last month, have been laid to rest. Chiegboka was also beheaded, just like his boss, after a week of being kidnapped at Aguata Local Government Area. Governor Chukwuma Soludo, who attended the burial of Chiegboka in Isuofia, where the governor also hails from, paid his last respect to the deceased. Until his death, the late Mr Chiegboka was Campaign Director to the deceased lawmaker, who was preparing to step up to the House of Representatives. His body and that of his boss were found on May 15 at Nnobi, after they were kidnapped by gunmen, while their severed heads were later found at Amichi, later the same day. The mass in honour of the Late Chiegboka which took place at St Paul’s Catholic Outstation, Isuofia was celebrated by the Catholic Bishop of Ekwulobia, Most Reverend Peter Okpalaeke, and drew tears to the eyes of all in attendance. Condoling the family and the entire Isuofia community, Governor Soludo revealed that four persons suspected to be to be part of those who murdered the lawmaker and his aide are already in custody. “We will not let the killers of Okoye and Chiegboka escape judgement. Already, four persons in connection to the killing have so far been arrested. “The criminality in the state is a contest between light and darkness. The criminal elements are sworn to gods who demand blood sacrifices, and that is why they are killing, but gradually, we are taking them out, one after the other.” Earlier in a homily, Bishop Okpalaeke declared that God will judge the perpetrators by himself as God is alive despite the situations. Bishop Okpalaeke described the late Chiegboka as a man who was committed to many causes that advanced humanity, calling on people to endeavour to get involved in things that will benefit God and society.
