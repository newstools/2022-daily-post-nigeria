Pastor William Kumuyi, General Superintendent of Deeper Christian Life Ministry, has shared his opinion on the fielding of either Muslim-Muslim ticket or Christian-Christian ticket for the 2023 presidential election. According to him, Nigeria’s political leaders need to consult and conduct research before concluding. Kumuyi gave the advice while addressing newsmen on Wednesday in Ilorin, shortly after he paid courtesy to Gov. Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq of Kwara. Kumuyi said that presidential flagbearers of various political parties should look at the heartbeat of Nigeria and the desires of people before making their decisions. “The Muslim-Muslim or Christian-Christan ticket is a difficult and slippery area. “So, what I will say is that the political office holders should look at the heartbeat of the country as well as desires of the people. “Politicians should know that they are not there for themselves. They are there for all of us. They should ask and make their researches about what the nation wants. “They should ask and make their researches on what the country wants, what the people want; if they listen to the people, we will be confident that they will listen to us when they get there,” he said.
