Former Manchester United attacking midfielder, Angel Gomes, has revealed how a brutal dressing discussion from manager Jose Mourinho during their time at Old Trafford left him on the verge of tears. Gomes insisted that his encounter with Mourinho made him feel the former Chelsea and Real Madrid coach hated him. The 21-year-old, who now plays for Lille in the French Ligue 1, opened up on his experience with Mourinho, who is currently the manager of AS Roma, at the Red Devils. Gomes told SPORTbible: “I have never actually told this story before, but one time, [Mourinho] took me to a cup game with the first team after I played with the Under 21s. “We were at the dinner table and he came around speaking to everyone. He then looks at me and says, “I am f***ed with you”.’ He added: “He was saying, “You were doing this and doing that but you should have done this and that”… and this was in front of the whole squad as well. “I would have b*****kings in my time but not from the big boss. I just was not expecting it. I was taken aback. He eventually finished shouting and carried on with what he was doing. “I was stuck in my seat. Eventually, some of the lads came over and said, “don’t worry, just ignore him, he’s trying to get a reaction from you. This is how he is.” “I was only young, so in my head, I was thinking, “F***, he hates me.” I went back to my room and rang my dad. I was nearly crying.” Gomes left Manchester United in the summer of 2020.
