A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Kassim Afegbua, has said it gladdens his heart that the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar, picked Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, who he described as a weaker candidate, as a running mate. Afegbua said the Delta State Governor, who was among the Southern Governors that moved for a Southern presidency come 2023, ended up betraying the South by working with Atiku. Speaking on Arise TV, the former Atiku Abubakar presidential campaign organization’s spokesman, also vowed to resign from the PDP and throw his weight behind the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu. “It gladdens my heart that Atiku has picked a weaker candidate as his running mate. It provides a golden opportunity for the APC, which has a Southern candidate and Peter Obi. “Okowa was among the governors who made the Southern declaration that the region should produce the next President but he went behind to work against it and betrayed the South because he was looking at becoming Vice president… “Atiku has used the Vice President slot to compensate him.” As DAILY POST earlier reported, Atiku Abubakar, who is the presidential candidate of the main opposition party, announced on Thursday that Okowa will be his running mate for the 2023 presidential election.
