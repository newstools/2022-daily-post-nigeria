The Nigeria Police Force (NPF) said it owns the Muhammadu Buhari Estate situated at Agemowo in Badagry, Lagos State.
On Saturday, the NPF confirmed that the property belongs to the Nigeria Police Cooperative Multipurpose Society. Videos and WhatsApp voice notes are circulating, alleging that Fulanis have camped in the estate in preparation for an attack in Lagos. A statement by Force Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi said the property is occupied by families of officers, who purchased apartments under the Police Cooperative Scheme. The spokesman declared that the pronouncement of “a mischievous alarmist” that armed men were residing in the estate was false. “It is unpatriotic that the maker of the video, who seemed educated and ought to know the dangers of disinformation, hurriedly and maliciously created and circulated the piece of falsehood.” Adejobi added that the person had a clear intent to cause unnecessary and avoidable panic in Lagos. The FPRO advised members of the public to discountenance the video “as the claims are totally false and frivolous”. The Force said it was important to carry out due diligence before churning out narratives with sentimental colourations to prevent disaffection in the country. Adejobi announced that Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba has ordered a probe of the “fake news”. The IGP also directed the Force Intelligence Bureau and Police Commissioner in Lagos, Abiodun Alabi to arrest and prosecute the originator,
