Manchester United midfielder, Bruno Fernandes, has said he expects Cristiano Ronaldo to return for pre-season training with the club. Ronaldo is being linked with a move away from Old Trafford, due to the club’s lack of activity in the summer transfer market. United are yet to add any senior player to a squad that finish sixth in the Premier League last season. It is believed Ronaldo’s agent, Jorge Mendes, has explored the possibility of the 37-year-old moving to Bayern Munich and Chelsea. But Fernandes told Record: “Cristiano Ronaldo situation? I spoke to him weeks ago, so I expect to meet Cristiano on day 4 for the pre-season training – and there’s nothing else. “I don’t think Man United are open to losing a top resource like Cristiano.”
