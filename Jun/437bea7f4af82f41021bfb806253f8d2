The National Identity Management Commission, NIMC, has refuted reports that the National Identity Number, NIN, records of Nigerians are missing from its database. NIMC’s Head of Corporate Communications, Kayode Adegoke, said reports that the commission lost 7.9 million NIN of Nigerians were false and misleading. A news platform, not DAILY POST, reported that NIMC may have lost 7.9m NIN records of Nigerians. Reacting, Adegoke, in a statement he signed, assured Nigerians that its database is safe and secure. According to Adegoke, NIMC database is impenetrable; hence no data can go missing. He said: “NIMC has noticed with great dismay an erroneous and malicious news report published in the Nigerian Tribune of June 7, 2022, with the deceptive and misleading headline: Did NIMC Lose NIN Records of 7.9 Million Nigerians? “In the said misleading report, the writer insinuated that NIMC lost 7.9m NIN records of Nigerians; the writer also gave varying inaccuracies of the NIMC database in an attempt to confuse and misinform the general public, including wrongly stating that the National Identification Number (NIN) is a 10-digit number. “The Management of NIMC wishes to reassure Nigerians that our database remains intact and impenetrable, and, no NIN records could have been missing.” He noted that the NIN is an “11-digit unique number.” Adegoke urged Nigerians to ignore the said report, stressing that it was a product of the “writer’s infantile imagination.”
