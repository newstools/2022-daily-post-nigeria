The Imo State Police Command has explained its findings on report alleging that “gunmen while enforcing sit-at-home order of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) yesterday, 20/06/2022, bombed the popular Izombe Central Market in Oguta Local Government Area of the state. According to a statement issued on Tuesday by the command’s spokesman, Michael Abattam, “there was no bomb explosion in Izombe Central Market on 20/6/2022.” The statement reads, “May I at this juncture, state the true facts surrounding the incident that actually occurred on 20/6/2022 in Izombe Central Market. “It is on record that there was no bomb explosion in Izombe Central Market on 20/6/2022, and there was no record at the disposal of the Command that, the traders were in anytime warned by members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) or it militia affiliate, Eastern Security Network (ESN) not to come out on Mondays for their businesses. “The community has always engaged in their market business without fear of molestation from anybody. “Preliminary investigation conducted by the Police Operatives on arrival at the market while responding to the distress on 20/6/2022 at about 1630hours, revealed that some overzealous miscreants came to the Izombe Central Market in Oguta LGA of Imo State, on a motorcycle, went to a stationed Bus where the conductor was canvassing for passengers traveling to Owerri and set it ablaze in the name of enforcing sit-at-home order in the community and left almost immediately after the act.” The Commissioner of Police, CP Mohammed Ahmed Barde, commends the people of Imo State for their unalloyed support given to the command and enjoined them to disregard false news as it is capable of causing palpable tension as well as installing fear in Imolites both at home and in diaspora, that there is insecurity in the State. He then warned mischief makers and those whose stock in trade is to circulate fake news, to desist from it, else they will be made to face the full wrath of the law if caught.
