The All Progressives Congress Zonal Secretary, South-South, Dr. Blessing Agbomhere has said that they are ready to support the presidential candidate of the party, Senator Bola Tinubu irrespective of who he chooses as his running mate. Agbomhere, who is also the Chairman of the Forum of APC Organising Secretaries, said a situation where leaders of some political groups and religious organisations were mounting pressure to influence the choice of one of their own does not augur well for the nation’s democracy. The party chieftain in a statement issued Saturday insisted that it was within the constitutional rights of Tinubu to pick his running mate, irrespective of the religious affiliation of the person. He urged Nigerians to give Tinubu the freedom to choose whoever he prefers as a running mate. Agbomhere added that what Nigerians should be interested in is the candidate and political party that will bring desired development to the country and not whether Tinubu would run for the presidency on a Muslim-Muslim, Christian-Christian or any other combination of religious faiths. He said: “All we need to do is to focus on winning the 2023 presidential election as a party and our victory will depend on our ability to carry Nigerians along. “We cannot afford to lose focus by being distracted about who Tinubu may decide to choose as his running mate. “The solution to the challenges confronting Nigeria does not rest on whether the running mate to Tinubu is Christian or Muslim. “Nigerians are not interested in who becomes running mate to any of the presidential candidates. What they need is good governance that would guarantee security, stable polity and social economic progress. “Nobody can carry a pass to the market on the basis of Muslim-Muslim or Christian-Christian tickets for Asiwaju or any other Presidential candidate and get food items free. They only need a ticket that would guarantee the availability of products and economic empowerment to meet their needs.”
