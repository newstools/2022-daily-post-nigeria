A lifeless body of a yet-to-be-identified young lady has been found around PW Bridge in Kubwa, Bwari Area Council Abuja. Residents said the body of the victim was cut into pieces, packed in a bag and dumped at a river bank in the area. While details of the incident are still sketchy, DAILY POST reports that it may not be unconnected with ritual activities of criminal elements in the area. When contacted, the Federal Capital Territory Police Command, said the body was found alongside two dead animals. ASP Oduniyi Omotayo, Deputy Police Public Relations Officer of the command told our correspondent that the remains of the deceased have been evacuated from the area. The Command’s Spokesman said, “We cannot at this point corroborate the tenet of many suggesting it was a ritual killing but unfortunately there was a killing and a dismembering of a human suspected to be a middle-aged female. “The body was found alongside that of two dead animals and has been removed from the scene for necessary procedures according to standard best practices, while an investigation is ongoing to provide answers to salient questions. “We urge the members of the public not to panic or spread panic by disseminating unverified narratives until facts surrounding the case are unravelled while the police remain on top of the situation”.
