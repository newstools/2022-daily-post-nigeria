Oyo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said that there is no vacancy at the Agodi secretariat in 2023. The party urged opposition political parties in the state not to waste their money. The PDP said this on Wednesday. The Agodi secretariat is the seat of the Oyo State Government. The PDP, which is the ruling party in the state, has however said that there is no vacancy in the secretariat. The party urged the major opposition political parties in the state, All Progressives Congress (APC), Accord Party, Social Democratic Party (SDP), Labour Party, and others not to waste their time and money ahead of the 2023 elections. The party in a statement signed by its Publicity Secretary, Engineer Akeem Olatunji, explained that it chose Barrister Bayo Lawal as the running mate to Governor Seyi Makinde because of his (Lawal) loyalty to the party. Olatunji in the statement made available to DAILY POST on Wednesday, condemned the current deputy governor, Engineer Rauf Olaniyan over his defection to APC. He said that the party is waiting for a time when Olaniyan will justify his action. “With this, we can confidently as the ruling party declare that 2023 governorship election in particular is already a sealed victory for PDP. “This is so because the combination of Governor Makinde and Barrister Bayo Lawal on a joint ticket is no doubt the winning team no political in the state wishes to contest against. “To say that deputy governor, Rauf Olaniyan betrayed every atom of the Yoruba ‘omoluabi’ ethos and exhibited the most ridiculous sense of political judgment by his defection to another party was, to say the least. “Needless to say that it is normal for opposition parties in the state to wish to try their luck, it is very important to remind those desperados that there is no vacancy in the Agodi Government House,” he said.
