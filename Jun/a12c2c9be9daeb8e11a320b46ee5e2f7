The Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, has expressed fear that Peter Obi, the candidate of the Labour Party, LP, may floor the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, and main opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP in 2023. Speaking with members of the PDP, Obaseki noted that his party could not even come second in the just concluded governorship election in Ekiti State. While the APC won the Ekiti governorship poll, the Social Democratic Party, PDP, came second and the PDP, a distant third place. Obaseki warned that the PDP must be more attractive for Nigerians, who are now following the LP and its candidate, Peter Obi, to consider it in the coming election. “How can PDP, a big party, couldn’t win but was not even number two. So you can see that something is going on and we do not want this to continue,” Obaseki told PDP stakeholders. “The history of our politics in the country is changing. I don’t know if you’re closely watching what is going on with the level of disenchantment with the existing political parties. I’m sure in all our homes we have so many people now who call themselves ‘Obedients’. “I don’t know if you have them in your houses, just asked them which party are you? They’ll say “Obedient”. “They don’t want us. They’re not talking about APC or PDP. They’re looking for alternatives. And they’re many, much much more. “You see all of them queuing for PVC. They’re not looking in the direction of PDP or APC. They’re looking for alternatives and if we don’t curb this and make our party attractive, I don’t know what will happen in the next election. “
