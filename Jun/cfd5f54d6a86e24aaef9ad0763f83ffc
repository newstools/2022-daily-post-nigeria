The Bola Ahmed Tinubu Presidential Campaign Organisation on Saturday accused the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of recruiting agents. The team described the allegations by the Centre for Reform and Public Advocacy against the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate as untrue. The group gave the police an ultimatum to arrest and initiate criminal prosecution against Tinubu for “false” academic qualifications to secure nomination. The Legal Adviser, Kalu Agu alleged that Tinubu supplied false information on oath in his Form EC9 submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). He said in 1999, Tinubu claimed to have attended Saint Paul Aroloya Children Home School, Ibadan between 1958 and 1964. Agu said the candidate also claimed he attended Government College Ibadan, between 1965 and 1969, but in 2022 said he never attended primary or secondary school in his EC9 form. Reacting on Saturday, Bayo Onanuga, Campaign Director of Communications, declared that the claims were not the facts. He told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the former Lagos Governor was more than qualified to be Nigeria’s president. Onanuga maintained that Tinubu did not submit fake certificates to the electoral umpire. The spokesman noted that the one certificate people keep referring to was not filled by him. Onanuga said Tinubu was exonerated in the House of Assembly’s report because former Senator Tokunbo Afikuyomi said he filled the form. The campaign noted that the certificate he gave to INEC this year was the same he used in 2003. Onanuga said while in exile, Tinubu’s house at Balarabe Musa Crescent in Surulere was burnt by the military. “This was what happened that time and if in 2022, he (Tinubu) now drew blank on that session, what offence has he committed? “Those who are making noise are PDP agents who are just trying to raise issues where there is none”, he added.
