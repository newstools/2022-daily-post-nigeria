The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is considering extending the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) ahead of the 2023 elections. INEC Chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu gave the hint at the Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS) in Lagos on Saturday. Yakubu attended the concert organized by Yiaga Africa and the European Union (EU) to mobilize youths to get their Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC). The electoral chief informed young Nigerians that INEC would soon make its decision public. “We have heard your requests loud and clear. You will soon hear from us on the extension of CVR registration. “Please assure me that you will register, pick your PVCs, and vote. I also assure you that your vote will count”, he said. On Friday, INEC confirmed the surge in registration for voter’s cards. National Commissioner, Festus Okoye announced the deployment of more than 200 machines to South-East states, Lagos and Kano. Nigerians are continuing their calls on the commission to extend the registration scheduled to end on June 30.
