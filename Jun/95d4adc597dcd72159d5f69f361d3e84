Lagos State Governor, Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has approved a flat rate increase by N100 in bus fares for all Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and Standard Routes with effect from July 13. Mr Kolawole Ojelabi, Assistant Director, Corporate Communication, Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority (LAMATA), made this known in a statement on Thursday. He said the increase was to sustain the operations of regulated bus services in Lagos state and the increase will take effect on July 13. He added that the fare increase aimed at ensuring sustainability of the BRT and standard route schemes was due to the attendant high number of buses out of operation as a result of lack of spare parts. “These measures are indispensable in the current global economic and environmental reality to ensure the sustainability of the BRI operation. “With the increase, a bus ride from Ikorodu – TBS will now cost N600 from N500 while Berger to Ajah is now N700, up from N600. “Oshodi to Abule Egba will cost N450 from N350 and Abule-Egba-CMS-Obalende will attract a fare of N600.” Ojelabi noted that the governor, in consenting to the fare increase, also approved a proposal for a bail out for the bus operating companies. He added that this was to cushion the effects of the harsh operating environment and safeguard private partnership investment and forestall the demise of formalised bus operations in the state.
