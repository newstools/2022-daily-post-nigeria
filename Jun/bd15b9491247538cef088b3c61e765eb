Juventus striker, Dusan Vlahovic, has given a reason why he rejected Arsenal to join the Old Lady. Arsenal were in the race to sign Vlahovic from Fiorentina in the January transfer window. The Gunners had submitted a £50 million bid to Fiorentina for the 22-year-old. But Vlahovic ended up making the move to Juventus in a £66.6 million deal, while his agent reportedly ignored Arsenal’s advances. Speaking on the development, Vlahovic said he had no intention of joining Arsenal last January, adding that he only wanted to join Juve. “Maybe my agent knows [about Arsenal’s offer], but I never talked to anyone about it,” Vlahovic said in an interview with The Telegraph. “I just had one club in my mind because Juventus is Juventus. There is nothing else to say. “And now I feel honoured to be given this jersey. It’s incredible every time I put it on. “I definitely identify with their DNA. The Juventus personality coincides with my personality. “When you come here you never give up, you fight all the time, you make sacrifices. This was definitely what I was looking for.”
