The Vice Chancellor of the University of Maiduguri (UNIMAID), Prof. Aliyu Shugaba has said that Borno, particularly the State capital, Maiduguri, is now safe for learning. The Vice Chancellor said this when he featured on the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Forum in Abuja, advising prospective students not to entertain fears of insecurity in the State. He said that the security situation in Borno State had improved significantly. According to him, while there was no doubt that the State was badly hit by insurgents in the wake of it, normalcy had returned to a large extent. “I know we have had our share of challenges as a state but the security situation has improved tremendously. “With our resilience, our school now records the highest number of students in Nigeria and in view of that we have worked significantly on our infrastructure to accommodate the number. “For instance we have put up mega halls with 500 to 700 students capacity,” he said.
