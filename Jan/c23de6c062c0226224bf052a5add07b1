Popular Nigerian aphrodisiac seller, Hauwa Saidu Mohammed, otherwise known as Jaruma, has spoken after her arrest by the Nigeria Police on Friday. Reports of her arrest by the police in Abuja made the rounds on Friday, January 21, 2022. There were claims that actress Regina Daniel’s billionaire husband, Ned Nwoko was responsible for her arrest. After her release, Jaruma in a video shared on her Instagram page, stated that someone who she abused used the Nigeria police to bully her. Recall that Jaruma had called out Regina Daniels for a sponsored advert she paid that didn’t do well. The Kayamata seller also claimed that her product used by Regina Daniels was responsible for the collapse of Nwoko’s marriage to Laila. But, Regina clarified that she has never used any of Jaruma’s products and was just paid to advertise for her as an ambassador. Nwoko also clarified that Jaruma was not responsible for the collapse of his marriage with his Moroccan wife, Laila Chanrai, adding that he divorced her because she had an affair with another man and had plastic surgery without his consent. Speaking on her arrest, Jaruma said, “I don’t know how someone would abuse you and you will abuse them back and then the person will now use the Nigeria Police to bully you, to silence you. “You’ll take someone’s land, the person will complain and you will send Nigeria Police to arrest them. “You’ll also take someone’s plantation, the person will complain, you’ll send Nigeria Police to arrest and put that person in prison. “I paid N10m for a job that was not done and I complained, boom, my own too don land for my head. “How many Nigerian youths do you want to put in jail?” Jaruma asked.
