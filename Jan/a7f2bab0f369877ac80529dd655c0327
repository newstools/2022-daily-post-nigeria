Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has ordered the immediate redeployment of a Divisional Police Officer, DPO, in Emohua Local Government Area of the State for operating an illegal refinery. The Governor gave the order on Friday during a meeting with the council chairmen at the Government House, Port Harcourt where he issued a 48-hour ultimatum to the council bosses to provide a list of illegal refineries in their domain. Wike also lambasted heads of the Nigerian Army, Nigerian Air force, Nigerian Navy, Nigerian Police, the Directorate of State Services and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps for allegedly allowing officers to aid crimes in the State. Governor Wike who told the State’s Police Commissioner, Eboka Friday to immediately redeploy the DPO and other officers allegedly aiding crimes in the State, also ordered the arrest of Chief W. J. Wocha, Fubara Ohaka, and Promise Ezekwe for operating illegal refineries. “It’s unfortunate for this country how security people will be involved in illegal bunkering. I can’t believe it. Mr. CP, I thank you for transferring the DPO in Rumuji, who owns a refinery. But the man must leave here, not transferred. “He must leave this State. I can’t be Governor here and a security man owns an illegal refinery. No, it is not possible…the man has to go. Take him to wherever they allow bunkering.” Wike, who was concerned about the harmful effects of the refineries on the health of residents, further urged the Commandant of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Rivers State command, to immediately transfer its personnel in charge of vandalization of pipelines in the State. “Transfer the man, and tell him to leave. He is a complete saboteur. I mean, how can security men be the one involved in this. What kind of country are we?” He lamented.
