A member of the House of Representatives, Simon Karu has named potential candidates for the position of standard-bearer for the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2023. Karu, representing the Kaltungo/Shongom federal constituency of Gombe State, spoke to reporters on Wednesday. The lawmaker endorsed Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Speaker Femi Gbajabiamiala and Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola. Karu, who ruled out APC leader Bola Tinubu, said any of the three, all from Lagos State, will move Nigeria forward if the party zones the ticket to the South. “If power shift favours the South, it is most likely the South-West because of its large followership within the ruling party. “I think there are three outstanding national figures that fit into the race undoubtedly with excellent qualities. Prof Yemi Osinbajo, Fashola and Speaker Gbajabiamila are good enough. “These men exude outstanding qualities as national figures with exceptional character for excellence. Their antecedents and current status have remarkable results that distinguish them among others in the South.” Karu added that the personalities have the potential and capacity to win any national election and do exceptionally great. On Tinubu, Ahmed said the APC leader “has run his days” though remains “undoubtedly a hero” “But time and season are important for every hero. ‘Zamani goma, sarki goma’. This simply implies every king with his season. “Tinubu is no longer a king and kingmakers have no place as kings”, the legislator declared.
