Augustine Eguavoen has disclosed his discussion with the Super Eagles at half-time of their 1-0 defeat to Tunisia at the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. Nigeria went into Sunday’s encounter as one of the most feared teams in the tournament having beaten Egypt, Sudan and Guinea Bissau in their opening three matches. But Tunisia humbled the Super Eagles, caging their main attackers and holding them down from flying. Nigeria recorded no shots on target. Eguavoen said the Tunisians stopped the Super Eagles wingers, Moses Simon in particular, from doing damage. “They formed their defence on a low block and then our ball movement from defence into midfield and attacking positions was sometimes slow,” Eguavoen told the press after the game. “That gave them the opportunity to always recover and double team on Simon and Chukwueze. We spoke about it when the game was on, it still didn’t improve. “In the first half, we discussed it, in the second half, the ball movement to the sides became a little bit faster but be that as it may the Tunisians forming a low block was a little bit difficult to crackdown.”
