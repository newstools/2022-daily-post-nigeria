The police have confirmed the killing of two persons by bandits in Madagali Local Government Area of Adamawa State. DAILY POST recalls that Madagali, which was under Boko Haram control between 2014 and 2015, had recently enjoyed relative peace. However, report emerged that a teenager, Ijarshu Markus, abducted alongside his mother and brother last week from their home in Maiwandu village, had been murdered by his captors. The mother and the other son were rescued by local vigilantes, while the gunmen made away with the deceased. The corpse of the 16-year-old boy was found three days later lying in the bush with two stab wounds on his chest and heart. The killing of the boy came less than 14 days after the killing of the village head, Ahmadu Sikari, who was shot twice at his residence at night when the bandits attempted to kidnap him. According to Mustapha Sanusi, the District Head of Duhu, the death of the village head and that of Ijarshu had caused panic among residents, appealing to the government to increase security in the area. He is of the opinion that some Boko Haram insurgents were now teaming up with other criminals to raise money for the insurgency through kidnapping for ransom. DSP Suleiman Nguroje, the Police Public Relations Officer in Adamawa, while confirming the incidents, explained that the police had deployed operatives to track down the perpetrators.
