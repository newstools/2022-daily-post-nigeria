The Zamfara State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has reacted to the statement credited to Professor Kabiru Jabaka, the State Deputy chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that Bello Matawalle’s administration is insensitive to the people’s welfare and security. Addressing newsmen at the Secretariat of the party in Gusau, the State capital, the State publicity Secretary of the APC, Comrade Yusuf Idris Gusau said that the PDP was only looking for cheap publicity to rubbish the image and reputation of the Governor. According to him, Jabaka still had some questions to answer bordering on alleged corrupt practices which he said amounted to over seven hundred million naira meant for assistance to orphans and widows in the State. “He embezzled the money which made Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle to sack him as the chairman of Zamfara State Zakkat and Endowment board,” he alleged. Yusuf called on anti-corruption agencies and the finance and appropriation committee of the State House of Assembly to investigate him with immediate effect. He noted that Jabaka’s statement was an empty propaganda that should be thrown into another waste paper basket, saying that even the deputy Governor, Barrister Mahdi Gusau had a case of corruption to answer. He said Jabaka was looking for a soft landing because of his alleged corrupt practices in government. But when contacted on phone, Professor Jabaka denied the allegations, maintaining that he was never sacked but that he resigned when the Governor defected to the APC. He added that he had no grudges with anybody.
