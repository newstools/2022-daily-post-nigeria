With this win, the Super Eagles have qualified for the second round of AFCON from group D. Reacting, Ahmad, in a series of tweets wrote: “It is always so good watching Super Eagles playing and winning matches. “I was in Garoua, Cameroon last week for the Super Eagles’ opening match, I really loved the way Garouans came out en masse to support Nigeria against their opponent, Egypt. “I am sure the same happened today. Garoua was founded by Modibbo Adama, the founder of Adamawa emirate.”
