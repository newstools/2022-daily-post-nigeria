The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide, OYC, has described the High Court judgment which went in the favour of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu as re-assuring. A High Court sitting in Abia State had awarded N1 billion against the Federal Government of Nigeria over the invasion of Nnamdi Kanu’s country home. Reacting to the judgement, the President-General of OYC, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike said the decision of the court showed that there was still hope in Nigeria. He said the court verdict came at a time when many people were no longer giving a chance to the judiciary. “This judgement brings a sense of hope to all Nigerians. It is highly re-assuring and commendable. “It shows that we still have courageous members of the bench in Nigeria who are ready to follow the law and apply it without pandering to the left or to the right. “We have always said that the military invasion of Nnamdi Kanu’s home was uncalled for since his court case was upcoming before that incident. “Our advice to the Government is to seek a political solution as suggested by the judge because that is the only way out and if the government is sincere to restore peace, it should not shy away from it,” Okwu stated. He, however, appealed to the members of the IPOB to maintain peace and follow the rule of law in their search for justice. “We have all seen that justice can still come by following legitimate means,” he noted. Meanwhile, the OYC has condemned what it called a deliberate attempt to malign South-East Governors. Okwu said this was evident in photo-shopped images currently in circulation on the social media, displaying the governors on biafra outfits. According to him, “this is blackmail taken too far and it must stop. We know those behind this mischief, which is all about the 2023 presidency. We shall soon expose the sponsors and the promoters.”
