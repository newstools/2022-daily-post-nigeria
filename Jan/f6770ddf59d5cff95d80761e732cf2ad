Chelsea director, Marina Granovskaia, has given three reasons why the club extends defender Thiago Silva’s contract at Stamford Bridge. DAILY POST had earlier reported that Silva signed a new contract with Chelsea that would see him remain at the west London club until the summer of 2023. The 37-year-old joined Chelsea in the summer of 2020 from Paris Saint-Germain. He won his first Champions League in his debut season for Chelsea. Speaking on the development, Granovskaia said Chelsea decided to extend the Brazilian’s contract because of the centre-back’s experience, leadership and performances. She told Chelsea’s official website: “Thiago Silva’s experience, leadership and performances have been and remain very important to this squad, so we are hugely pleased to extend his contract by another year. “We look forward to his continued influence as we seek honours this season and next, and more of the qualities that have led to him having such a big impact for us on and off the pitch.”
