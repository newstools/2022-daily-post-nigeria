Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Ondo, Most Reverend Jude Arogundade, has disclosed that measures must be taken to rescue the country from its current doldrums. While stressing that the challenges facing the country will not be beneficial to anyone and the country at large if nothing was done to salvage the situation, the Bishop urged the country’s leaders to provide the necessary solutions. According to Arogundade, the citizenry must also come together in unity in order to honour “the legacy of the generation that left us so much to hope for.” The Catholic Bishop disclosed this during the weekend at St. Joseph’s Catholic Church, Igbara-Oke, headquarters of Ifedore Local Government Area of Ondo State. In his homily, the priest said, “our country is at a crossroad and no individual can save it all alone. We must all accept that the challenges and controversies in our country today do us no good. We must come together to unite around our common purpose and shared vision. “They must be resolved to give new hope to citizens and the assurance that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. “We must teach our youth how to be self-reliant and to take responsibility for their lives and our common patrimony – Nigeria. “Our youth need to be told that leadership is not about power but about purpose, not about popularity but about integrity. This is where many people have missed the point about the goal, mission and direction of our nation.”
