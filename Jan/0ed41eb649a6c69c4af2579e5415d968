Bagos Dachung, the lawmaker representing Jos South/Jos East Federal Constituency of Plateau State, has revealed that dark spots around some federal government institutions in Jos have become kidnapping spots. Dachung revealed this while moving a motion on Tuesday on the escalating insecurity in Plateau State. The lawmaker said the National Veterinary Institute (NVRI) and the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS) are now hotspots in the state. Dachung said a traditional ruler, Gwom Rwei of Vwang Da Balak was abducted while driving home around the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies in Vom. He expressed worry that despite the use of the National Identification Number (NIN) kidnapping has become a daily routine in the state. Following the adoption of the motion, the House resolved that the two institutions install Street lights and surveillance cameras within their surroundings. In addition, the House mandated the Inspector General of Police to equip the Community Police with walkie talkie radios to enhance communication amongst Community Police Ofﬁcials to aide rescue operations amongst themselves.
