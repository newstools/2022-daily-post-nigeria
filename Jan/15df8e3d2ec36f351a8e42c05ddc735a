Everton has been offered the chance to sign Alexis Sanchez from Inter Milan, according to the UK Sun. The 33-year-old has Premier League experience, having scored 80 goals for Arsenal in a three-and-a-half stint. Sanchez, however, struggled at Manchester United, finding the back of the net just five times in 18 months. He was offloaded to Inter in the summer of 2019 and although he won Serie A last season, the Chilean is yet to rediscover good form. Although he still has 18 months left on his current deal, the Italian champions are willing to let him leave on a free transfer. Despite Sanchez’s recent woes, he could prove to be a decent bit of business for Everton due to their troubling situation. Rafa Benitez’s side is currently 15th in the Premier League and are unable to spend big due to financial fair play.
