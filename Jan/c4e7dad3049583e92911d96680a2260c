Christian Eriksen is in talks with Brentford over an initial six-month contract, ESPN reports. The 29-year-old is currently a free agent after his contract with Inter Milan was terminated in December. Eriksen cannot play in Italy, because of his cardiac device implant. The midfielder suffered a cardiac arrest during Denmark’s opening game of Euro 2020 against Finland in June last year and received life-saving treatment on the pitch before being taken to hospital. He was then fitted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Although he cannot feature in Serie A, Eriksen believes he can continue to play at the highest level. Although Tottenham manager, Antonio Conte, said the player would be welcomed back at the club, negotiations are said to be at an early stage with Brentford. Brentford manager, Thomas Frank, previously coached Eriksen while working for Denmark with the under-17 team. Other clubs in England and other countries are also talking to Eriksen’s representatives about a possible deal.
