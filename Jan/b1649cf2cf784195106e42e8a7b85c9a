Leader of Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), Edwin Clark, has given reasons why he would support the Presidential ambition of Bukola Saraki, former Senate President. Clark vowed to support Saraki’s presidential ambition if the Southern part of the country fails to produce a consensus candidate in 2023. He spoke when the Abubakar Bukola Saraki Contact and Advocacy Council, visited him in Abuja yesterday. The PANDEF leader described the former Senate President as “the best for Nigeria.” He commended Saraki for his sterling performance as a Senate President in the 8th Senate. “We have been agitating for the presidency to be zoned to the south. However, if we fail to come up with a consensus candidate in the South, I will have no option but to support Dr Bukola Saraki,” Clark declared. Recall that the former Kwara State Governor, last week hinted at joining the 2023 presidential race.
