The Jigawa High Court of Justice No. 6 sitting in Birnin Kudu Local Government, on Friday, sentenced a 35-year-old Musa Mu’azu to life imprisonment for raping a 15-year-old girl. The prosecution counsel narrated to the court that the defendant was seen coming out from an uncompleted building with the victim in a suspicious manner and upon inquiries by the person who saw the defendant with the victim, the defendant confessed to have taken the victim to the building and had illicit sexual intercourse with her. However, the defendant pleaded for the issue to be covered up and eventually the case was reported to the police. He said during interrogation, the suspect confessed to have committed the offence of rape but denied the charges on arraignment. The prosecution counsel, therefore, presented four witnesses and tendered three exhibits, while the defendant testified in his defence. Delivering the Judgement, Justice Musa Ubale held that the prosecution had proved their case beyond reasonable doubt. He, therefore, sentenced the defendant to life imprisonment for the offence of rape.
