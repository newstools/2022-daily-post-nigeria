Some Constabulary Police posted to Zamfara State have alleged that they have served the Nigerian government for one year and two months without salary or any form of allowance. Addressing newsmen at the press centre in Gusau, the state capital, the leader of the group, Ishaku Sani said the first time they were posted to Zamfara State, they were given N1000 each for transportation but that later stopped. “Although we were employed by the federal government and not the state government, the state government is supposed to give us some allowances to justify our efforts,” he said. The group said Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle, when contacted on the matter, told them it was not the responsibility of the state government to pay them salaries or allowances but promised to find a solution to their plights. He explained that the security situation in the state warrants the state government to help them with allowances, insisting that most of them have families to carter for. “Many of the constabulary policemen have left the job as there was no salary nor allowances” But when contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer(PPRO) SP Mohammed Shehu said the constabulary men were volunteers and that it was indicated in the forms they signed and were brought for training to defend their communities. The police spokesman said the men came from all Local Government Areas of the State, saying the emirs of the 14 Local areas stood for them. According to him, it is not the responsibility of the police to pay them any salary or allowance, saying that if they demand salary or allowance, let them go to the state government.
