A woman, Zainab AbdulAfeez has been detained by the Osun State Command of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) for allegedly pouring hot water on her 11-year-old daughter. The woman, who resides in the Oke-Onitea area of Osogbo, the State capital, has been infamous for beating her daughter whom she had for her first husband, who is Lagos based, before she remarried in Osun. Her neighbours also revealed that she was fond of beating her daughter with sticks and wire cables which ended up severely injuring the girl. Also, neighbours revealed that all efforts made by her second husband to pacify and caution her had always met a brick wall. The neighbours revealed that the latest incident started on Saturday when she lost a key belonging to her mother. “The girl saw the key but her mother vowed to beat her. She became afraid and when her mother told her to grind pepper, she refused and her mother Zainab poured hot water on her chest and body,” the source said. Confirming the incident to DAILY POST, Daniel Adigun, the spokesperson of the Osun NSCDC command, stated that Zainab used the calabash she was using to stir yam flour to scoop hot water and pour on her daughter. Adigun disclosed that the command had commenced investigation into the matter after which the outcome will be made known to the press.
