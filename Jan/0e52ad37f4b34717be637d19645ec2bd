Former Newcastle striker, Alan Shearer, has said Marcus Rashford’s winner against West Ham on Saturday could have been disallowed for offside. Rashford scored in the third minute of injury time, tapping home an Edinson Cavani cross. Cavani was freed by an Anthony Martial through ball, with TV replays showing he was only very marginally onside. Shearer feels VAR could have come to a different conclusion and saved West Ham a point. “All four of us in the office thought it was going to be given offside. In the image we saw that was frozen, Edinson Cavani looked offside. “It will be tough to take for West Ham when you have worked so hard and fought so hard like they did. To lose it in that fashion, it is hard to take,” Shearer told BBC Radio 5 Live.
