Popular Nigerian professional dancer and instructor, Kafayat Ameh, known as Kaffy Dance has confirmed publicly that her marriage to her husband, Joseph Ameh has crashed. Kaffy disclosed this in her new podcast episode ‘JustKaffy’. She declared that she’s single but not searching. There were rumours sometime in 2021 that the couple were separated; however, the dancer refused to address this. Kaffy revealed that she was bitter in her marriage and that taking a chance to breakup her marriage was to see both parties grow in their different career. According to her, marriage is supposed to be an alignment of destinies but hers didn’t work out that way. Kaffy got married to Joseph Ameh in 2012 and they have two children together. The dancer said, “I wanted to see my ex-husband in his best version, so taking a chance to break this marriage was also to see that we both grew in what we are really supposed to be. Marriage is supposed to be an alignment of destinies driving towards a place God wants for them and mine didn’t work out that way. “Separation is not the end of life for both parties involved, in fact if you both are honest about why you have to go apart, you will realize how much better life can be. I was in a bitter place when it comes to my marriage, I was frustrated and angry but got freedom from that space and I’m in a space of healing and open to new relationships. “I look at my ex-husband now and I don’t feel a type of way, but wish him the best. I’m single and not searching. “Some people make it back, some don’t; what is ultimate is the outcome borne out of love, rather than looking at someone as the problem, you may be the enabler of that problem.”
