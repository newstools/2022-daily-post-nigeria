Rio Ferdinand has named two Manchester United players that could join Anthony Martial out of the club this January. The 26-year-old has already reached an agreement with Spanish LaLiga side, Sevilla and would leave Manchester United on loan in a matter of hours. Edinson Cavani, Jesse Lingard, Henderson and Donny van de Beek are the other players who are not happy at the club over the lack of playing time and are asking to leave. “You’ve got Donny van de Beek sitting there probably going to go somewhere, interested to see where he goes,” Ferdinand told his FIVE YouTube channel. “The same with Jesse Lingard – my betting head would probably say Newcastle with Jesse. But these are players that need to go out and play football and Martial is one of them. “He’s shown glimpses throughout his career at Man United where you think, ‘Wow, this kid could be ultra-special’ but then there’s been times where he’s been underwhelming and you thought, ‘This isn’t good enough’. So hopefully he improves [on loan] and it frees up a bit of space for Man United to go and get someone else.”
