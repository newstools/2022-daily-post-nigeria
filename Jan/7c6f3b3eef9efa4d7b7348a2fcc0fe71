Super Eagles boss, Austin Eguavoen has revealed that Chidozie Awaziem is down and will not be available against Sudan. Nigeria defeated Egypt 1-0 in their opening Group D match and will face Sudan for their second encounter on Saturday. There were rumours that Awaziem has been unavailable due to Covid-19 but the Turkey-based defender, according to Eguavoen, is suffering from injury. Eguavoen said the defender would not be available when the Super Eagles file out against the Falcons of Sudan at the Roumdé Adjia Stadium, Garoua on Saturday. “Hopefully soon, that is beyond my control. I think if the medical staff were here now they will certify him fit to be back on the pitch,” he told his press conference on Friday. “Awaziem is still down, he has an ankle injury as I know and he is going to be back very, very soon”.
