Manchester United midfielder, Fred, has revealed that teammate Cristiano Ronaldo is very upset with Portugal’s situation because they have been relegated to a World Cup playoff. Portugal finished second in their World Cup qualification group behind Serbia. Fernando Santos’ men must now win in two playoff matches to secure their place in the FIFA 2022 World Cup in Qatar later this year. Portugal lost 2-1 in the crucial final qualifying match against Serbia as they ended three points behind the Group A leaders. “We talk a little bit about this. Of course, he is very upset about not qualifying directly for the World Cup,” Fred told Eurosport. “But, as a great player and as their captain, he knows how to prepare his teammates in order to qualify. Obviously, he was very upset, but he will work hard to be at the World Cup. “Everybody knows that he wants to win everything, every time. So rest assured he will work hard to be at this World Cup.”
