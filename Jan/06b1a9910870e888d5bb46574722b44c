Ian Alexander Jr., the son of Actress Regina King, has died by suicide. The family says they are devastated to the deepest level by the loss. Ian, a DJ, clocked 26 Wednesday. “He was such a bright light who cared so deeply about the happiness of others. “Our family asks for respectful consideration during this private time”, King said in a statement to People. The deceased was her only child, whom she shared with ex-husband and record producer Ian Alexander Sr. After their separation in 2007, King said being a single parent was not easy but that she loved her son deeply. “You don’t know what unconditional love is. You may say you do, but if you don’t have a child, you don’t know what that is,” she stated. King, also a director, has received an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and four Primetime Emmy Awards. In 2019, Time magazine named the star one of the 100 most influential people in the world.
