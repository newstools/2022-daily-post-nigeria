A former Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Attahiru Jega has urged President Muhammadu Buhari and the National Assembly to pass the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021, immediately.

While the debate over direct and indirect mode of primaries continues, Professor Jega explained that the bill contains a lot of new amendments. 36 recommendations had been made for the bill by INEC to the National Assembly, 31 of which were approved with little or no amendments.
