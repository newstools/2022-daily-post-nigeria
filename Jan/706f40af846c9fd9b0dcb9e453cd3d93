The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said it will withhold timetable for the 2023 general election pending when the Electoral Act amendment bill is passed into law. This was disclosed on Tuesday by the INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, at the first quarterly meeting with political parties for 2022 in Abuja. According to him, the commission was looking forward to a speedy passage of the bill before it will release the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the much-anticipated elections. He said, “On the Electoral Amendment Bill currently before the National Assembly, the commission is encouraged by the Senate President’s assurance to give priority attention to the Bill when the National Assembly reconvenes from its recess today, and the commitment by the President to assent to the Bill as soon as the issue of mode of primaries by political parties is resolved. “We are looking forward to a speedy passage of the Bill, which is crucial to our preparations for the forthcoming elections. As soon as it is signed into law, the commission will quickly release the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2023 General Election which will be based on the new law”. Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari had rejected the bill following the inclusion of compulsory direct primaries for political parties. Returning the bill to the National Assembly, the President pointed out that the present state of the country would not be fit for compulsory direct primary elections, demanding its removal from the bill.
