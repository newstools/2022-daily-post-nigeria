The All Progressives Congress (APC), Enugu State Chapter says it was elated when Enugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, hosted the immediate-past Commissioner for Lands and Urban Development in the State, Dr. Victor Chukwuemeka Nnam at the Government House, Enugu, during the New Year celebrations. DAILY POST recalls that Nnam’s resignation as commissioner late last year came with backlash from several quarters, including the organized labour which accused him of unlawful seizure of a land belonging to the NULGE. In a press statement released on Sunday, the chairman of APC Enugu State Chapter, Comrade Adolphus Ude stated that “whereas we of the APC family welcomes the reconciliation between His Excellency, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, governor of Enugu State and his estranged Commissioner, Dr Victor Nnam, especially in this yuletide, we demand immediate recovery of dubious land transactions which is the genesis of the altercation between the duo.” Ude said, “Since Enugu is in the hands of Almighty God, the land scandal which has gone viral cannot be swept under the carpet as God frowns at fraud.” The statement narrated how Ugwuanyi while receiving Nnam who came in company of his friends, family members and well wishers, talked of true forgiveness, promising to sustain the tempo of peace and good governance in the state to improve the living standard of the people as the true heroes of democracy. The APC said while it was not against peace, the ex-commissioner must answer for all he did while in office.
