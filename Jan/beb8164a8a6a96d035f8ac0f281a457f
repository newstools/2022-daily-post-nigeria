Ghana is out of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in the group stages. This is following a shock 3-2 defeat to debutants Comoros on Tuesday night. The Black Stars came into their final Group C clash with one point and needed a win to progress. But the tiny Island nation took the lead through El Fardou Ben as early as the fourth minute. Ahmed Mogni then made it 2-0 after Andre Ayew had been shown a red card in the first half. Ghana fought back to level the game through Richmond Boakye and Alexander Djiku, before Mogni struck again to record a famous win. It is the first time in their history that the West African nations have failed to win at least one group stage match having made 22 past visits to the finals.
