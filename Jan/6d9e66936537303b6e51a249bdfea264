The Rapid Response Squad (RRS) in Lagos, led by its Commander, CSP Olayinka Egbeyemi, has arrested two principal suspects in the constant clashes in Idumota and its environs. RRS in a statement on Monday said the clashes have intermittently crippled commercial activities in the area. The suspects, identified as Kunle Poly and Sego, were arrested at a meeting where the two National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) members, along with some other stakeholders, converged on Monday. The statement added that ”the recent clash which occurred last week Thursday reportedly led to the death of a victim while commercial activities were paralyzed in the area for some time until a joint team of police officers were deployed immediately to the area to restore peace. ”Kunle Poly and Sego are presently being transferred to Zone II, Onikan, Lagos State.”
