Former Commissioner for Information in Edo State, Prince Kassim Afegbua, has said that President Muhammadu Buhari has further damaged Alhaji Atiku Abubakar’s chances of becoming Nigeria’s president at the age of 77. According to him, Buhari has not helped matters by raising curiosity about the sanctity of anyone becoming Nigeria’s President at old age. Afegbua, a former spokesman to Atiku, said old age has not allowed Buhari to be creative and result-driven, with the president confessing recently that at 79, working six to eight hours daily is no joke. Afegbua said for this reason “It will be an exercise in self-destruct to chart the course of an Atiku post-Buhari era.” In a statement he signed and made available to DAILY POST on Monday, the Edo State Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, chieftain, also noted that Atiku has lost the moral rights to seek the party’s presidential ticket. He said the reason was that the former Vice President dumped the party and its court cases and relocated to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, after the 2019 election. “He was nowhere to be seen. His next address was Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. When the party members wanted to see him, they had to travel to Dubai,” he added. “The tribunal came, and Alhaji was nowhere near the courts. We waited, kept our eyes on the road, thinking he would join us.” He blamed Atiku for the PDP’s lost battles in court, insisting it would have been a different ball game had the former vice president and his lawyers appeared in court but according to him, “Alhaji Atiku disappeared into thin air.”
