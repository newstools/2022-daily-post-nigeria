Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State has decried the nature of democracy as currently practised in the country, canvassing that there is a need to infuse the “sensitivity of the African culture”. He addressed APC stakeholders in Calabar on why he must hand over to a successor from Cross River South Senatorial District in 2023. “We inherited a brand of democracy which is not Afrocentric, neither does it have the sensitivity of the African culture and morality. “Democracy is so primitively blind that it reduces itself to numbers. “The higher your population, the more you win. So there is nothing like balancing, there is no equity in democracy. “There is no moral conscience. Democracy is blind to ethnicity, it is blind to religion, it is blind to fairness, it is repugnant to natural justice,” he said. Ayade, however, dispelled speculations that he is backtracking on his commitment to return power to the south. “So, to be able to balance that, as governor, I still uphold my declaration that my successor will come from the south and indeed, he would come from the south,” he maintained. The governor, who said he could not and would not play God by being specific on who his successor will be, added that his role is to be fair. “The South had taken a turn to produce a governor in Donald Duke, the Central had also produced a governor in Sen. Liyel Imoke and the North has produced one in me. “So, it is common sense that we must go back to the South for equity. Every zone should know that their turn would come one day.”
