Pandemonium broke out at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja on Wednesday when passengers staged a protest over flight delays by Dana air. The protesting passengers complained that they were not informed about the delay until they began to register their grievances. Dana Manager, Mr Dahiru told DAILY POST that flights to Enugu were not safe at the time of the schedule. The Manager claimed that Dana was not aware that their planes were not in good shape, hence the late announcement. When asked to tell the difference between the initial flight time and the rescheduled time, he declined comments, claiming he did not understand the question. As of the time of filing this report, tension is high at the airport as many passengers have now requested a refund. Some of the passengers were said to have lost their items as a result of the protest. They called on the Nigerian government to immediately act on the incessant and unpredictable issues with Dana air. Video:
