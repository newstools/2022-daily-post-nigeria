Popular Nollywood actress, Iyabo Ojo has called for guns to be legalized in Nigeria to deal with child molesters. The mother-of-two made this known while reacting to a video posted by comedienne, Princess, on her Instagram page. Princess, whose foster daughter was allegedly sexually abused by Yoruba actor, Baba Ijesha, shared a video of a four-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted by her teacher. Alongside the video, Princess wrote: “Abuse of minors have become the new trend in Nigeria and only a few people are speaking up. Even in the animal kingdom, it’s not this bad. Our society stigmatizes, even threatening victims and their parents, while the perpetrators like Baba Ijesha walk freely. “Our children are being destroyed daily and most people see it as cruise.” Reacting, Iyabo Ojo made it clear that anyone who messes with her children will be dealt with. The mother of two wrote: “Can they just legalise guns because some demons need to be taken out as soon as possible. “F**k with my kids and you’re so f**ked.”
