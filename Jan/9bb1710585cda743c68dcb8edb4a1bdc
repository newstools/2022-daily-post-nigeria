Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, the Director, Publicity and Advocacy, Northern Elders Forum (NEF), has said that it was a big mistake done in the country by voting President Muhammadu Buhari in the first instance. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed made the disclosure while fielding questions from newsmen in Kaduna on Saturday of the meeting of Northern Leaders of Thought. The Director, Publicity and Advocacy of NEF explained that whoever would be voted into power in 2023, should have a team in place to hit the ground running once sworn-in. According to him, Nigeria would be in for a ride if it takes six months for a President to name his team. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed described as unpatriotic and undemocratic the calls by a group from the south, demanding that all political parties field only southern candidates ahead of the 2023 presidential polls. He wondered how a region would be left out from the ballots, while such parties would be expecting votes from the North.
