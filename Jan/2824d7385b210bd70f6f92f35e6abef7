Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has again reiterated that his administration will not relent on its fight against criminals and kidnappers. He vowed that tough times await any criminal operating in the state. The Governor spoke Sunday, January 16th, 2022, at the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, Hope of Glory Parish, Nyiman in Makurdi, the state capital, where he worshipped with other believers. Governor Ortom stated that hardened criminals who terrorised the state in the past had not found it funny, stressing that his administration, through the combined efforts of security agencies, will not surrender the state to criminals. While stressing the determination of his administration to do all that is necessary to ensure peace in the state, Governor Ortom charged Christians to listen to God and walk with Him to order their steps. He reiterated his resolve to allow God to direct and work through him while urging believers to apply faith with works in all they do. Earlier, in a sermon, Pastor Moses Adagba, who spoke on the topic: “Wonders of His Presence,” described God as God of Wonders who does things without anyone’s permission. He explained, “God’s presence means knowing God and God knowing you. If one dwells in the presence of God, whatever he says will surely come to pass.” Pastor Adagba disclosed that there are so many benefits to being in the presence of God and urged Christians to ensure that they dwell in the presence of God in order not to be found wanting when He comes.
