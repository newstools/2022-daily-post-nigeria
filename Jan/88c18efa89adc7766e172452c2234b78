Judiciary workers and litigants were on Tuesday thrown into panic after what appeared to be a fetish substance was found around the court premises. A dead bird, which had its head chopped off, was found in one of the lobbies leading to the courtrooms. The substance was said to have unsettled judiciary workers. The Chief Registrar of the Rivers State High court, Davide Ihua Maduenyi, who spoke to journalists on the incident said it is the second time such item would be dropped in the court premises. While expressing concerns over the incident, the Chief Registrar assured that “the judiciary will beef up security in and around the premises”. He also urged judiciary workers to always give out prompt information on any incident around their environment.
