The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Saturday saluted members of the Nigerian Armed Forces for their courage, loyalty, sacrifice and resilience in defending our dear nation, particularly in the face of resurged insecurity in the last six years. The National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Debo Ologunagba, in a statement said the party acknowledges the bravery and patriotism of our gallant soldiers in the frontlines, who, despite the daunting challenges, daily put their lives on the line, with many paying the supreme price for the unity and security of our country. The PDP also demands that the government takes steps to provide the Nigerian military with adequate equipment as well as improve the welfare of our troops to ensure effectiveness in their duty to the nation. According to the party, Remembrance Day presents the government the occasion for sober reflection to get more committed towards internal security and the fight against terrorism in our country, particularly in limiting the extent of avoidable danger which our military is exposed to daily. The PDP urges the government to ensure the wellbeing of the families of our fallen heroes who gave their lives for our nation. Their families and loved ones should not be allowed to continue to suffer. It also urges Nigerians to continue to support and pray for the armed forces in their onerous task of protecting our country, adding that Nigerians should also continue to supplicate for the unity of our nation.
