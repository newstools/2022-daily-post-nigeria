Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand, has hit out at Arsenal defender Gabriel, following the Gunners’ Premier League 2-1 loss to Manchester City on New Year’s Day. Ferdinand branded Gabriel’s behaviour as ‘stupid’ and ‘immature’ after the Brazilian was sent off during Arsenal’s defeat to Man City at Emirates. Bukayo Saka gave Arsenal the lead in the first half, but Riyad Mahrez equalized with a penalty in the second half after Gabriel was booked for trying to scuff up the spot. Gabriel was then given his marching orders just two minutes later for a petulant foul on fellow countryman Gabriel Jesus as Rodri netted a late winner to give the visitors all three points. Reflecting on Gabriel’s second yellow card, Ferdinand told BT Sport: “This is stupid, this is immature, this is petulant. A penalty against your team… What do you think you’re achieving by doing that? “This is where stupidity enhances itself. He’s not going in on goal, he’s not a threat, he’s in the middle of the pitch and straightaway after that incident, you commit a silly foul like that. “You’re in disbelief, I don’t understand it.” He added: “You’ve got time to think, you know you’re on a yellow card. You get a yellow card in a game and automatically, you think, “Right, I’ve got to adjust the way I approach certain situations now.” “He’s had red mist. He’s still thinking about the penalty and that’s the problem. He’s thinking about the penalty that went on previously and he’s in that moment there. “He doesn’t see that the referee is only 10 yards away and he’s half a pitch away from the goal area where there’s going to be a danger. There’s no danger.” Arsenal’s next game is against Liverpool in the EFL Cup semi-final on Thursday.
