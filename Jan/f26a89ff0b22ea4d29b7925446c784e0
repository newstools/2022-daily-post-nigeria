Nigeria interim coach, Augustine Eguavoen, has repeated the feat he first achieved at the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations, following a 2-0 win over Guinea-Bissau on Wednesday. The Super Eagles became the only country at the 2021 edition to win all their group games. Eguavoen made eight changes to the team after wins over Egypt and Sudan had secured a Round of 16 ticket. After a goalless first half, Umar Sadiq converted from close range after receiving an exquisite cross from Kelechi Iheanacho. In the 75th minute, Moses Simon dribbled through defenders, before hitting the crossbar. William Troost-Ekong was on hand to score the rebound from close range. At first, the goal was ruled offside, a VAR review validated it. Nigeria topped Group D with nine points, three more than Egypt. Sudan and Guinea-Bissau both finished with one point each.
