Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has declared his admiration of the life of the late Adebayo Alao-Akala. The politician died on Tuesday at the age of 71. He had been ill since 2021. Obasanjo praised the deceased for not limiting himself, becoming a governor from being in the police. In a condolence letter to the Head of Akala Family in Ibadan, Obasanjo, said the death was a grievous loss to them, friends, associates and supporters. He noted that Alao-Akala contributed immensely to the development and stability of Oyo State and Nigeria. The retired General said he transcended the narrow precincts of what used to be cultural limitation to tower over his peers. “His humble career as a policeman did not stymie his ascendancy to the height of a Governor and unprecedentedly crowned him as a high achieving Deputy Governor, who became an Acting Governor and later Governor. “There seemed to be nothing stopping the effervescent enigma. His politics had been that of a thorough bred statesman, determined to make the critical difference in the lives of the people he led. “He succeeded in building confidence across a wide spectrum of the social strata and validated the mandate bestowed on him as the Executive Governor of Oyo State. “Indeed, the vacuum created by his death would undoubtedly be difficult to fill. I assure you that we all share your sense of deep grief.” Obasanjo told Alao-Akala’s admirers to hold on to their faith in the Almighty Creator who understands and arranges all things. He prayed that God would comfort them and grant the departed eternal bliss in Heaven.
