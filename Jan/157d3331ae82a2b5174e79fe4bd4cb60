The Defence Headquarters (DHQ) has warned politicians and others against wearing military uniforms and accoutrements. Acting Director of Information, Air Commodore Wap Maigida issued a statement to this effect on Thursday. The spokesman decried campaign posters showing some governors dressed in camouflage uniforms. Maigida declared that such was illegal and a clear abuse of privilege. He said the Armed Forces of Nigeria remains apolitical and would not want to be dragged into politics. Politicians and civilians were advised to stop wearing “camo” for political events and other engagements henceforth. “Please note, anyone found culpable in this regard would be liable to prosecution”, the statement added.
