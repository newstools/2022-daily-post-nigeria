Governor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State has anointed the state’s Commissioner for Lands and Water Resources, Pastor Uno Eno, as a preferred candidate that would succeed him in 2023. This has brought to an end months of speculations and suspense about who would succeed the governor even as he had promised to disclose his choice candidate at the appropriate time. This was made known at the end of PDP stakeholders’ meeting on Sunday evening. The former Governor, Obong (Arc) Victor Attah, made the formal presentation of Pastor Eno to the stakeholders, which comprised major and leading political chieftains from the three senatorial districts of the state. All the stakeholders present lauded the governor for picking Pastor Eno as his successor and promised to work towards his emergence as the governor of the state in 2023. Responding, Pastor Eno thanked God and the governor for finding him worthy of the onerous task to lead the people of the state and continue the people-focused and developmental strides of Governor Udom Emmanuel. Bishop Uma Ukpai and the Prelate Emeritus of the Methodist Church of Nigeria, Dr. Sunday Mbang prayed for him, a sentiment that was re-echoed by the Oku Ibom Ibibio and Chairman of State Council of Chiefs, Ntenyin Solomon Etuk.
