There was pandemonium in Oke Aregba area of Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, after some teenage boys were caught burning the head of a girl, said to be in a relationship with one of them, for money ritual. In the early hours of Saturday, one Mr. Segun Adewusi, who is the community security guard, had observed that some four boys were burning something suspected to be the human head in a local pot on the road. DAILY POST gathered that the security guard immediately alerted the police at Adatan station, who went to the scene to get three of the boys arrested as one had fled before police arrived. A source, who confirmed the incident to our correspondent, said the slain girl, identified as Rofiat, was a resident of Idi-Ape; she was a girlfriend to one Soliu, who is now in police net.

Soliu was the boyfriend of the girl, he ran away, but was later arrested. “They killed Rofiat, cut her head, packed the headless body in a sack and started burning the head in a pot. They told the police in the presence of a mammoth crowd that they wanted to use it for money ritual. “The police have taken the body away to a mortuary,” a source told our correspondent on Saturday. In a video made available to our correspondent, Mustakeem Balogun, said, “We wanted to use just her head alone for money ritual.
