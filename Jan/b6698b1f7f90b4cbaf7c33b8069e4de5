Publisher of SaharaReporters, Omoyele Sowore, has lambasted the Federal Government for filling fresh terrorism charge against the detained leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. DAILY POST had reported that the FG on Monday, amended the charges it filed against the secessionist at the Federal High Court in Abuja, increasing the counts to include terrorism. Reacting, the Nigerian human rights activist, slammed the government saying the President Muhammadu Buhari’s government is the one practicing terrorism by allegedly kidnapping Kanu from Kenya. In a post on his verified Facebook page, Sowore demanded Kanu’s freedom with the hash tag, RevolutionNow. The post reads, “FreeNnamdiKanu. A government of terrorists filing frivolous terrorism charges when they are the ones that carried out a terrorist act by kidnapping Kanu from Kenya and extraordinarily “renditioning” to Nigeria! #RevolutionNow”. DAILY POST reports that the amendment is coming few hours to the resumption of Nnamdi Kanu’s trial as he is expected to appear in court on Tuesday.
