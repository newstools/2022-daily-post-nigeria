Nollywood actor, Ugezu J Ugezu, has called on the Nigerian government to make it a criminal offense for influencers to advertise products they’ve not used to their fans. His advice comes after Regina Daniels released a statement about influencing products for Jaruma, which led to their face-off online. Recall that Jaruma had called out Regina Daniels for receiving money for influencing ‘Kayanmata’ products but failed to deliver effectively. The aphrodisiac seller also claimed that her product used by Regina Daniels was responsible for the collapse of Nwoko’s marriage to Laila. But, Regina defending herself, said she never used any of Jaruma’s products on herself or her husband, Ned Nwoko, adding that she just advertised the products because she was paid to do so. This led to Ned Nwoko reportedly arresting Jaruma for false accusation. Reacting, actor Ogezu said, making influencers pay for not using products they advertise will help checkmate things in Nigeria and heal the nation. On his Instagram page, the veteran actor wrote: “One of the many ways to start healing our land is to make it a criminal offense for influencers to boldly influence people to use what they are not using. “This in my considered view will checkmate many things, if my suggestion is not valid to you, suggest yours.”
