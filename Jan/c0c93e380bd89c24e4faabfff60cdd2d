President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday, said Nigerians must display a sense of fairness when assessing his administration’s efforts in tackling insecurity. According to the President, if Nigerians must do so, they must reflect on what was obtained at the time he took over office in 2015, and what currently prevails. In his opinion, the decisive break from the past, where security in the Northeast and the South-South was in dire straits should be the basis for benchmarking his administration’s performance and successes now. He made these remarks, while playing host to the Grand Khalifa (overall head) of the Tijjaniyya Islamic Movement World-Wide, who paid him a visit at the State House, Abuja on Friday. According to the President, the Northwest, which had been a pain to the nation in terms of insecurity will experience a turnaround for the better. He said the current administration is well aware of its responsibility with regards to security and will continue to do its best. He equally urged citizens to show more interest in the affairs of their own security including complementing what the government is doing. His words, “We have done our best and we will continue to do more by pursuing coherent and consistent policies to deal with terrorism. I hope God will listen to our prayers.” Addressing Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, the Governor of Kano State, who led the Grand Khalifa on the visit, Buhari said, “We thank you for inviting them to come to pray for peace and stability in our country. We are grateful that they agreed to come.”
He joined them in praying that God will give guidance and strength to leaders to be accountable and do right in all things that they do. The delegation, included the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero and Sheikh Dahiru Usman Bauchi, the leader of the Tijjaniyya Islamic Movement in Nigeria. They were in the country to lead prayers, considering the complexities around insecurity in particular.
