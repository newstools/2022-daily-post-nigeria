The National Assembly Legislative Aides Forum, an umbrella body of aides working with lawmakers in the upper and lower legislative chambers, has written to the Clerk of the National Assembly (CNA), Architect Amos Olatunde Ojo, condemning payment splitting. The letter, dated 7th January, 2022, signed by the Chairman and Secretary, Salisu Zuru and Bola Adeyemo respectively, expressed disappointment at the clerk’s action by paying only one month arrears of 2019 out of six months salaries owed. The forum complained that the Clerk deliberately sidelined the 3-man Committee which consisted of members of the aides to work with the National Assembly management to resolve issues of salary arrears, but lamented that when the Federal Ministry of Finance released funds to that effect, the Clerk only paid one month. A copy of the letter which was sighted by DAILY POST in Abuja on Saturday, demanded that full arrears be paid without delay. It added that each aide’s outstanding entitlement should be reworked and paid, given that it has tarried for long. This, the group said, would strenghten harmonious relationship between the NASS management and aides. Part of the letter read: “However, the 3-man Adhoc Committee was set to interface with the National Assembly management on the payment of 2019 salary arrears, but unfortunately, was officially and deliberately sidelined. “We have been shortchanged of our 2019 salary arrears. We are being owed between four to six months, but the NASS management only paid one month across board when there is evidence that the Federal Ministry of Finance has released funds for full payment of arrears.” They insisted that the three-man committee should be carried along to offset the arrears, describing the action of the Clerk as uncalled for.
