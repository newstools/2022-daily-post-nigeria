Following the collapse of some mines in Biase LGA of Cross River State which reportedly killed no fewer than six men on Wednesday, the chairman of the council, Mrs Ada Charles and police authorities have accused the firms operating there of doing so illegally. The council chairman said she does not know about the existence of the firms. A source close to the Commissioner of Police in the state said the council chairman cannot claim a lack of knowledge of the mine operators, being the chief security officer of the council. The source said the so-called illegal miners have operated in Biase LGA for years yet the council have not bothered to draw the attention of security agencies to their activities but are now feigning ignorance. Council Secretary, Daniel Ivang also buttressed the lack of knowledge of the firms, explaining that the boys who died were not employees of the firms. “The boys normally sneak deep into the mines in the night, using torchlights. They would cart away the precious stones for sale in the night. “One of the deeper holes collapsed on them. “I am not sure of the actual number of those that died inside that hole but certainly more than three. “The Council Chairman, I and others had gone to the scene when the news broke to confirm. She has ordered the closure of the mines pending investigation.”
