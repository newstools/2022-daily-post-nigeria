Ex-Nigeria international, Segun Odegbami, has predicted two countries that will reach the final of the ongoing 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON. Odegbami predicted that Nigeria and Cameroon would play the final of the ongoing AFCON come February 6. Recall that both Nigeria and Cameroon have met at the grand finale of the continental championship three times in the past, with the Indomitable Lions claiming the win on each occasion. Both Cameroon and Nigeria have booked their place at the AFCON round of 16 after winning their first two games. Cameroon defeated Burkina Faso 2-1 on the opening day before thrashing Ethiopia 4-1 on match-day two. Nigeria, on the other hand, defeated Egypt 1-0 and won 3-1 against Sudan. “So far, the Eagles may not have played the best brand of football,” Odegbami told Complete Sports. “But with the range of talent in the team now, and Augustine Eguavoen’s ability to deploy them the way he did in the first match, it is not difficult to assume that at the ‘tape’, Nigeria and Cameroon are likely to be the two teams still standing to battle it out in a photo-finish. “That is my prediction.”
