She wrote, ”Guys, I’m sick and tired of y’all insinuating @funkejenifaakindele and I are fighting for no singular reason. In case y’all don’t know this woman right here is my ride till the end. I love her from the bottom of my heart and what we share is beyond friendship. ”We talk every day, we see almost every other day, the fact that we don’t post our moments lately doesn’t mean we are fighting!!! We are only saving it for a bigger picture and we need to keep y’all in suspense. ”Lafunky is my blood and flesh. You all should please stop insinuating! We are good and forever good, maybe not necessary but just need to put this out here for clarity. That’s my homegirl here. Oya e file fun Lafunky.”
