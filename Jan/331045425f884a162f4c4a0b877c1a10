The wife of famous Nigerian comedian, Mabel Makun, has revealed she had three miscarriages while looking for a second child. Recall that AY and his wife welcomed their second child days ago after 13 years. Speaking on her pregnancy struggles on Instagram, Mabel said she had three horrid miscarriages that had no medical explanations. Her post read, “This will trigger my emotions; the plan was to close/open my eyes and make it all disappear, but then again, I thought to myself, Mabel you have to encourage someone out there. “I had three miscarriages with no medical explanations as to reasons why. It was the same pattern as before, every single thing that happened with the others, happened again, only this time more, but I was determined to hold on tight to God and not fail. “Anal bleeding, threatened miscarriage, difficulty in breathing.” She mentioned that she was not psychologically and mentally stable which was the hardest part of her journey. “My emotions were all over the place, had to stop myself every time I felt the urge just to break down and cry. “Struggled within not to blame me for not protecting and fighting for the survival of the babies I lost, placenta separation and weak uterus. “Truthfully, I was exhausted, how I got here today is not something that I can explain, but I just know that God was and is still with me and Ayomide, for this we are eternally grateful,” Mabel wrote.
