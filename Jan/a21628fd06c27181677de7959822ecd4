Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, has cautioned South-West Governors and Yoruba Obas against breaching the Yoruba tradition. He said the observation of traditional rites before installation and burial of royal fathers are part of sacred rites. Adams, in a statement, decried the desecration of age-long rituals, describing such as “monumental disaster” Noting that traditional rulers are custodian of the Yoruba culture, he said “rites are also part of our treasured tradition”. “Once you remove them from the Yoruba institution, the whole essence of the tradition is lost and the institution is empty” Adams maintains that rites give Obas reverence and remains the depth of core values, including myths that enable them to be respected as deities. The Aare said the spirituality of the process is beyond what anybody can desecrate because a Yoruba monarch is regarded as a god and second in command to the creator of heaven and earth. He, however, condemned the killing of people for rituals in the name of preserving traditional rites. The Oodua People’s Congress (OPC) leader noted that traditional rites for installing or burying a monarch is beyond the family. “It is purely a community affair. I am appealing to our royal fathers to stay away from actions that tend to destroy Yoruba culture and tradition”, the statement added. On Monday, Ogun Governor, Dapo Abiodun signed the law stopping the imposition of rituals during installation and burial of Obas. They can now be installed without seclusion (Ipebi), and be buried in accordance with their respective religion instead of being buried by traditionalists. The ‘Obas, Chiefs, Council of Obas and Traditional Council Law of Ogun State, Bill 2021’ seeks to respect human dignity and promote modernity.
