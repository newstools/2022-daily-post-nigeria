The All Progressives Congress (APC) has said that the timing of the planned subsidy removal would cause hardship on citizens. To this end, the governing party has commended the Federal Government for suspending the move. The National Secretary of Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Sen. John Akpanudoedehe, in a statement issued Monday said its removal at this time would have heightened inflation and caused undue hardship on the citizenry. He said its removal in due course would usher in the eventual and full deregulation of the country’s petroleum sector. The secretary stressed that in line with the new Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the Federal Government was already putting in place measures, particularly boosting the local refining capacities to reduce the country’s reliance on expensive import of refined petroleum products. Akpanudoedehe stated: “We commend President Muhammadu Buhari for always putting the welfare and well being of Nigerians first as he has serially displayed in the implementation of programmes and policies of this administration. “Commendably, the federal government took into consideration the fact that the removal of subsidy at this time will heighten inflation and cause undue hardship on the citizenry.” The party commended the cordial and healthy relations between the executive and the 9th National Assembly which has ensured good governance. It added that Nigerians have been the ultimate beneficiaries as displayed in the positive outcomes of the meeting between the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Dr. Zainab Ahmed; and the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan on the suspension of the planned subsidy removal.
