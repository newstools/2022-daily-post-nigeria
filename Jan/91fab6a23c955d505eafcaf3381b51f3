A 200 level student of the University of Calabar, Jeremiah Chukwudi has explained that his inability to pay examination fees and heavy family burdens forced him to attempt to take his life Friday morning. Jeremiah is a student of the Department of Public Administration, Faculty of Management Science of the University. Eyewitnesses said the suicide attempt happened in Jeremiah’s house in Calabar and it was his neighbours who rescued him. Speaking with reporters, emotional Jeremiah said he was fed up with life. “I have been in difficulty for some time now especially after my father was involved in a fatal vehicular accident and his spinal cord was severely affected. We borrowed and borrowed when he was on oxygen and nowhere else to borrow. He died on 24 December 2021. My mother is not doing anything. “My exams are next week. I have not been able to pay exam fees. They are closing the portal on 25 January 2022. And without payment of fees, I am not going to write the exams. Since the burdens of the family and fear of not writing the exams weighed much on me, I said there was no need to live on…” He pleaded with UNICAL authorities to please give students more time to avoid many dropping out of school. Meanwhile, an aide to the Governor on Education, Castro Ezama begged students not to take drastic measures in such situations. He also asked the school management to extend the time for the payment of fees to help those who have the same issues as Jeremiah.
