Fiifi Tackie, the spokesperson for the Ayew family, has dismissed reports that Andre Ayew and Jordan Ayew have quitted the Black Stars ahead of Ghana’s World Cup qualifying playoffs double legs fixtures against Nigeria in March. Reports had emerged this week that Andrew, who is currently the captain of the Ghana national team, and his younger brother, Jordan, have decided to stop playing for the Black Stars. This comes following Ghana’s shock elimination from the 2021 AFCON in the group stage after losing 3-2 against Comoros. However, according to Tackie, the Ayew brothers are committed to Ghana and are focused on giving their all to the Black Stars. “Andrè and Jordan Ayew are still very committed to the Black Stars team as they have always been,” Tackie tweeted on Thursday. “They will keep donning the Black Stars jersey to represent Ghana and give the team their very best on and off the pitch, as always. We just got off the phone.”
