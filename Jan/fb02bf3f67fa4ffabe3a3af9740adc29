Nigerian winger, Samuel Chukwueze, has identified Napoli striker, Victor Osimhen, as the player he misses at the ongoing 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cameroon. Chukwueze said Osimhen would have scored at least three goals if he were with the Super Eagles team at the 2021 AFCON. He described Osimhen as a ‘beast’, adding that he wished the former Lille star was with Nigeria’s national team in Cameroon. Osimhen would have been in the lineup of Augustine Eguavoen’s side at the AFCON, but he had to withdraw from the squad after failing to recover from a facial injury. “Nobody will not miss Victor [Osimhen] because he is a beast on the field of play, I miss him,” Chukwueze said after the recovery session on Sunday in Garoua. “I wish he was here, I think by now we would have been scoring three to four goals, so many goals.” Chukwueze added, “I need to get more goals and assists, I need to do more for the success of the team, it is not only one goal that I will score at this tournament. “I already set my target for the tournament, the goals and assists I need to get.” Nigeria’s next game is against Guinea-Bissau on Wednesday.
