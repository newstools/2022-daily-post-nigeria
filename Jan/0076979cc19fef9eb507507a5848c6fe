The Anambra State Police commissioner, CP Echeng Eworo, has urged indigenes of the state to shun mob action that can result in deaths. This is coming as two alleged armed robbers met their waterloo in Onitsha, beside Conoil filling station, along the express road on Wednesday. The alleged robbers were said to have come on a motorcycle and robbed some Awada residents of their money, phones and other items and shot in the air to scare people, before trying to escape. A source said the robbers were unlucky as they were given a hot chase, and were captured after the MCC Junction, where the residents placed the motorcycle on top of them and burnt them. Reacting to this, Eworo urged the members of the public, who resort to jungle justice, to exercise restraint and hand over suspects to the police for proper investigation. In a press release made available to DAILY POST by the spokesperson for Anambra State Police Command, DSP Toochukwu Ikenga, the commissioner was quoted as saying: “Information revealed that at about 5:30 pm on 19/1/2022, the yet unidentified armed suspects, operating with a motorcycle, robbed some persons in their shops at Awada. “During a hot chase by an angry mob when they discovered the robbers were using a toy gun, accosted the suspects at Oraifite street by Ogbo bread and set them ablaze with their motorcycles.” The Commissioner, who frowned at such an act, thanked the members of the public for assisting the police in apprehending suspected criminals but urged them to always exercise restraint by not taking the law into their hands. “They should endeavour to take such suspects to the nearest Police Station whenever they are apprehended. This would afford the Police the opportunity to conduct an appropriate investigation into the nefarious activities of the suspects, and bring them to justice in accordance with extant laws,” he said.
