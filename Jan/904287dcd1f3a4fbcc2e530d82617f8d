The death of five-year-old school girl Hanifa Abubakar believed to have been murdered in her school premises by her tutors under mysterious circumstances in Kano has elicited reactions from the presidency. Recall that little Hanifa had gone missing since December last year, prompting intelligence agencies to launch a search into her whereabouts. The security agencies made a breakthrough recently, as her body was discovered in a shallow grave in Kano, after almost two months of search by security operatives. President Muhammadu Buhari’s media aide, Garba Shehu, while reacting to the development, lauded the efforts of the police and the secret service in unraveling the mystery behind the disappearance of Hanifa. DAILY POST gathered that the arrest of her teacher and his other accomplices in the child’s kidnap and murder have also been effected. Buhari said the entire country, which was following the incident with keen interest, were optimistic that Hanifa would be rescued alive. The President also said the painstaking detective operation by the security operatives, which led to the discovery of the corpse and the arrest of the suspects who have already made confessions, was quite commendable. “When breakthroughs like this happen, people will talk differently of law enforcement,” the President stated. While praying for the repose of the soul of the little school girl, the President urged her parents to bear the sad loss with courage and fortitude in God. He equally charged the Police and Ministry of Justice to uphold the integrity of the detective work that busted the case by preparing well and presenting a good case that will earn the respect of the court.
