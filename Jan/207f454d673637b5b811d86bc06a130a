The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Osun State said no fewer than two people escaped death on Monday in an accident that occurred on Gbongan -Ibadan Expressway. The report was contained in a statement issued by the FRSC Sector Commander, Mr Paul Okpe, on Monday. Okpe said the accident which involved two vehicles occurred around Naira-Kobo Junction, eight kilometres to Asejire Bridge in Osun State. According to him, the accident happened at about 11:25am and two persons escaped death. “A Blue Toyota Corolla car with number plate AKM 227 SX collided with a red MACK articulated vehicle that had no number plate. “Two victims were involved and they were both injured but not dead,’’ he said. He said the command was able to clear all forms of obstruction to ensure the free flow of traffic. The Sector Commander attributed the cause of the accident to speeding and non-compliance with road traffic regulations. Okpe, however, cautioned motorists to desist from any form of road violation, capable of leading to loss of lives and property.
