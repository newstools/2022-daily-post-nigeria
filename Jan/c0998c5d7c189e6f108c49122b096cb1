The organized body of credible civil society platforms comprising over 200 groups and championed by the Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has endorsed the move by Nigerian lawmakers to set up a trust fund for the National Youth Service Corps, NYSC. DAILY POST reports that a bill seeking to establish National Youth Service Corps Trust Fund (NYSCTF), last Thursday passed second reading in the House of Representatives. The bill, which was sponsored by Rep. Akinfolarin Mayowa (APC-Ondo), aims at providing a sustainable source of funds for the youth service scheme for aggressive acquisition of technology-driven skills. In a statement on Tuesday, HURIWA noted that the move would keep thousands of youths busy in the pursuit of their dreams which would in turn keep them away from being used in the 2023 general election as political thugs. The rights group tasked both the National Assembly and President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure that the bill is passed and signed into law to enable the NYSC’S management to take thousands of Nigerian youths out of the unemployment market. “We reached a consensus that the idea of a trust fund to be managed for the development and capacity building of young graduates and the expansion of infrastructures by the NYSC all across Nigeria will inevitably become one of the biggest economic legacies to be bequeathed by any national leader of Nigeria. “Therefore, we resolve to send a letter to president Muhammadu Buhari and Senate president and his counterpart in the Federal House of Representatives to encourage them to quicken the process of actualizing the setting up of the NYSC’S Youth Trust Fund. “We think that it is imperative to have a vibrant Trust Fund for young Nigerian graduates to harness and develop their skills, innate talents and creative gifts for national growth. “Such a move will tremendously serve the greatest national security interest of Nigeria”, HURIWA added.
