AC Milan have set their sights on Manchester United defender centre-back, Eric Bailly, Sky Italia report. The Serie A giants have focused their attention on the Ivory Coast international as they look to bring in a replacement for Simon Kjaer following his injury lay-off. AC Milan wants an initial loan deal for the 27-year-old similar to the one that saw them sign Fikayo Tomori from Chelsea last season. Meanwhile, Arsenal defender Cedric Soares is the subject of interest from Atletico Madrid, according to Nicolo Schira. Diego Simeone’s side are looking at Soares as they seek extra cover at the back following Kieran Trippier’s move to Premier League side Newcastle United. Soares, 30, is not the only player on Atletico Madrid’s list. The Liga champions also have RB Leipzig star Nordi Mukiele and Lille’s Mehmet Zeki Çelik on their list.
