A chieftain of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chuks Ibegbu, has urged some Northerners aspiring to contest for the presidency to shelve their ambition. Ibegbu, the former Deputy spokesman of Ohanaeze,asked Atiku Abubakar, Bukola Saraki, Bala Mohammed, Aminu Tambuwal, and Yahaya Bello should shelve their presidential ambitions. He asked the northerners to rather support the Southeast in producing a Nigerian president in 2023. In a chat with DAILY POST, Ibegbu said the Southeast has a larger stake in Nigeria, hence will not leave the country. Ibegbu said, “Ndigbo has the largest stakes in Nigeria and will not leave it for strangers “Ndi Mbiara Abia’. “Landlords do not leave their house for tenants. We are part owners of Nigeria and cannot leave for anybody unless what happened in 1966 will happen again. But this time we shall not allow such to happen. “Go to Kano, Kaduna, Sokoto, Maiduguri, Lagos, Ibadan, Zamfara, Port Harcourt, we have built Nigeria though Nigeria appears ungrateful. “We cannot, however, abandon our efforts. We got independence for Nigeria, we built Nigeria, we have invested a lot in Nigeria. But I advise Nigerians to show gratitude to Ndigbo at least in 2023 by supporting an Igbo to enter Aso Rock for the benefit of all Nigerians. “Atiku, Bala Mohammed, Tambuwal, Yahaya Bello, Zulum, Saraki, other Northern presidential aspirants should support an Igbo presidential candidate.”
