The Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige has said he would reveal his intentions on the 2023 presidency to Nigerians during the Easter period. Ngige explained that he is still consulting with relevant stakeholders across the country on running for Presidency in 2023. The former Anambra State Governor spoke at the state’s office of the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment in Awka at the weekend. Ngige disbursed empowerment facilities to members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the State. Overwhelmed by the empowerment, Anambra women led by lady Nancy Okafor urged the minister to vie for the Presidency. She noted that Ngige was the right candidate from the Southeast. Responding, Ngige said: “We’ve started political talks again. Please, give me around Easter where we’re going to have another session like this to discuss your request. “I’m still consulting the political leaders in the country on your request, by that time I will decide, I know it’s my right to decide on that. I will take such a decision at the appropriate time.”
