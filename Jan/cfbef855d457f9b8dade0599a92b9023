Nigeria’s Senate President, Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, has lamented the killing of a driver at Garin Alkali in Bursari Local Government of Yobe State. The driver was reportedly shot by a security agent on Saturday which triggered violent protests in the neighbouring town of Gashua, the headquarters of Bade Local Government on Saturday. In a statement by the Senate President’s Special Adviser on Media on Sunday, Mr Ola Awoniyi, Lawan consoled the family of the late driver, saying that the incident should be thoroughly investigated with a view to bringing whoever has a hand in the killing to justice. He described the incident as wicked and reprehensible given that the driver was going about his business when he was shot by a security agent at Garin Alkali on Saturday, adding that if not for the quick intervention of the State governor, Alhaji Mai Mala Buni, the resultant protest would have led to the breakdown of law and order. “My heart goes out to the family of the victim. May Allah console them over their bereavement. “I urge the authorities to thoroughly investigate the incident with a view to establishing why and how it happened and applying appropriate sanctions to deter future recurrence. “I urge members of the community never to take the law into their hands whatever the provocation as such reactions often lead to further tragedies,” Lawan said. The Senate President commends the Yobe State government and the Police for their quick intervention which helped to quickly douse the tension and restore normalcy to the affected community.
