A Super Tucano airstrike has eliminated an Islamic State’s West Africa Province (ISWAP) leader and foot soldiers, including foreign fighters. The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) operation under Operation Hadin Kai took out the terrorists at Kirta Wulgo in Borno State. Mallam Ari, Commander in charge of the area, and mercenaries fabricating Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) for ISWAP died in the attack. A military officer told PRNigeria that the location was targeted after intelligence revealed scores of insurgents converging at Northeast Kirta Wulgo. “Some were seen with weapons around a make-shift structure, a likely indication that the structure might have had a high calibre terrorist target. “The structures were burnt and destroyed at the fringes. Several ISWAP fighters were neutralized including Mallam Ari, the Fiya of Kirta Wulgo,” he was quoted to have said. The Fiya title is held by the second in the hierarchy of the terrorists’ military structure. NAF spokesperson, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, confirmed that the bombardment was successful.
