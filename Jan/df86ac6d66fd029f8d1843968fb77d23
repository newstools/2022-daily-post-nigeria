The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Governors’ Forum has called on the National Assembly to quickly conclude deliberations on the Electoral Act Amendment Bill and override President Muhammadu Buhari’s veto as fast as possible if need be. The PDP Governors made the request at its regular meeting held in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital on Monday, being the first in 2022, where they also advised the lawmakers to delete the areas of complaints in the bill. The forum further wondered why the security operatives and the All Progressives Congress, APC-led government have failed to solve the security issues in parts of the country. The PDP governors lamented the continued state of insecurity in the country, the persistent and ceaseless shedding of blood on a daily basis and the near collapse of the security situation in Nigeria. “The strategies to confront terrorists, kidnappers, bandits and other criminals is still a major problem of the APC administration,” the main opposition governors said. The Governors, therefore, called on the president to reconsider his position and consider decentralisation and restructuring of the security architecture as the most viable solution, together with proper arming, funding and training requirements for Security Agencies. Present in the meeting include Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, Udom Emmanuel, Douye Diri, Samuel Ortom, Ifeanyi Okowa, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, Nyesom Wike, Oluseyi Abiodun, Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, and Bala Mohammed.
