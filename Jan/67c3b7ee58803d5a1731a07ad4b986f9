Nollywood actress, Mercy Aigbe has been criticised for sharing a post revealing her new lover, popular Yoruba movie marketer, Kazeem Adeoti. The actress celebrating his birthday took to Instagram to share loved up pictures with him. The post stirred reactions on social media as some Nigerians claimed the actress’s new lover is still married to his wife. Reacting to the social media backlash, Mercy’s ex-husband, Lanre Gentry took to his Instagram page to share an old picture of him, his ex-wife and her new lover. Recall that Lanre had accused his estranged wife of having extramarital affairs while they were still a couple. He thanked God publicly for revealing one of the numerous ‘truths’. Alongside the photo, he wrote, “At last I thank God the truth is out, this is just one of many to God be the glory.” Also media personality, Shade Ladipo slammed Mercy Aigbe for having a relationship knowing he’s still married with kids. On her Instagram story, she wrote: “ My gender sha, so you see a married man with a family and you camp there. You don’t see your worth being second fiddle or a possible family destroyer. “How are you even attracted to a married man. If you are over 30 years and still sleeping with married men then I feel sorry for you. (Under 30 you’re still foolish so I excuse your behaviour). Sorry because you don’t know your worth.” Meanwhile, Mercy Aigbe is paying no mind to the backlash as she has continued to share pictures and celebrate her new lover.
