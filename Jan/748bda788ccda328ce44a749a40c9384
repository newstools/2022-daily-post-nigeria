The State Executive Council of the Rivers State council of the Nigeria Labour Congress has met in Port Harcourt and resolved that there is no going back on the planned protest by NLC on the 27 of this month. The state leadership of the NLC at the meeting on Tuesday, set up an 11-member action committee to ensure the success of the protest. Briefing journalists at the end of the meeting in Port Harcourt, the state Chairman of the NLC, Beatrice Itubo, said the action is in compliance with the directive of the national leadership of the union. She added that the union will meet with civil society organisations in the state on Wednesday as part of the mobilization for the planned protest. She said “Arising from today’s meeting, we have resolved that we are going to comply 100 per cent with the directives of the national secretariat as regards the rally of 27 January, 2022. “We have also agreed that we shall come out in our numbers and process from Labour House to the government house to submit our demand.” The Labour also vowed that this year will not be business as usual, stressing that the state government must meet all their pending demands including the implementation of the report of a tripartite committee. “We are ready as you can see from the faces of the labour leaders here. We are having zero tolerance this year for issues that are anti-labour.”
