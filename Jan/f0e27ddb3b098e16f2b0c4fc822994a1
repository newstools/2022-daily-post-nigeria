Former Nigerian midfielder, Henry Nwosu says Augustine Eguavoen is the best-suited coach to take charge of the Super Eagles when they clash with the Black Stars of Ghana. He called on the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to keep Eguavoen in the position of coach of Nigeria national team ahead of the Super Eagles’ World Cup qualifying playoffs double legs fixtures against Ghana in March. According to him, Eguavoen has the technical and tactical capability to edge out Ghana in the 2022 FIFA World Cup playoff, which is scheduled to take place between March 23 and 29. The Super Eagles are seeking to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar after crashing out of the 2021 AFCON in Cameroon. Nigeria was defeated 1-0 against Tunisia in the AFCON round of 16 tie. “I have never doubted Eguavoen’s technical and tactical know-how in the round leather game. I really think he has done a good job with the team despite their ouster from the AFCON tournament,” Nwosu told Completesports. “It’s in this regard I believe he has what it takes to overcome the Black Stars of Ghana for a slot in the 2022 World Cup playoff.”
