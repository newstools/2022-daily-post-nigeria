The Leader Of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, on Wednesday, issued a prophetic statement on the reported presidential ambition of the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo. Primate Ayodele said Osinbajo should not mismanage his money because he will face crisis, scandals and several documents will be used against him. In a statement by his media aide, Osho Oluwatosin, the clergyman warned that God has not anointed him to rule Nigeria. He noted that his ambition will cause issues between him and his superior, President Muhammadu Buhari. According to Ayodele: ‘’I want to advise the Vice President of Nigeria, Yemi Osinbajo not to mismanage his money on his presidential ambition. He will face several crises and lots of documents will be used against him. ‘’He has not consulted God, He shouldn’t deceive himself with Babangida’s endorsement, God did not anoint him to rule Nigeria. “God has honoured him already and instead of wasting resources, he should consult God well but at the moment, VP Osinbajo isn’t who God has in plan for Nigeria. ‘’President Buhari doesn’t want him there including some of his subordinates, they will use scandals to finish him.”
