The Kwara State Fire Service, on Friday, evacuated two boys, namely Damilare 12years old and Kamaldeen 14years old from Asa River at Laola Salasi Street, Mubo area, Ilorin. The incident occurred Thursday evening at about 16:36hrs (04:36pm), when one Alhaji Eleja suddenly summoned the fire service personnel to the scene of the incident. However, DAILY POST reports that the two victims (Kamaldeen and Damilare) were recovered dead from the river by the firemen. The victims are from Ile-laru compound, Sabo-line area Ilorin, in the State capital. They went with their colleagues to swim at Asa-River before two of them eventually drowned. Their corpses were handed over to their father, Alhaji Jamiu before leaving the scene of the incident. The Director, Kwara State Fire Service, Prince Falade John Olumuyiwa, advised citizens, particularly parents and teachers to keep monitoring their children’s movement, especially during this holiday period in order to avoid such terrible occurrences.
