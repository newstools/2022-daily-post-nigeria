A former Governor of Borno State, Ali Modu Sheriff has insisted that the purported zoning of the chairmanship position of the All Progressives Congress to the North-central zone was fake. Sheriff stated this during a media interaction on Friday in Abuja, ahead of the party’s convention slated for February 26. He said he was the target of the story because all other aspirants are afraid of going into the convention with him. He was of the opinion that anyone can be chairman but not everybody has the capacity to be the chairman. Sheriff stated: “I have to tell you an interesting story, I read it from Newspapers. The caption was that Ali Sheriff is edged out, why Ali Sheriff?. Supposed that was the situation, is it only Ali Sheriff that was looking for chairman in the northeast? There are so many. “So, it clearly shows you that those that are writing this are afraid of the man called Ali Sheriff. They are afraid, Ali Sheriff is the target, they don’t probably want to go to the convention with Ali Sheriff, they are afraid, period.” But the former Senator insisted that since the leadership of the party has denied it, the purported zoning is fake. “Party is run by human beings, the party is run by the party leadership. The party leadership as of today has not even constituted any committee. They were meeting for the last three or four days to even come up with a committee for everything – for the zoning, for the election, for everything. So, the party came up and said we have not even sat. There are no more questions to ask.” On insinuation that he was nursing presidential ambition, Sheriff clarified that he does not want to be a president, adding that he is only contesting for the party chairmanship position. He said he wants party members to help President Muhammadu Buhari to hand over to another APC president.
