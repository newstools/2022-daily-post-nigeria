Two persons on Monday died in a road accident which occurred at 7. 00am on the Oyo-Ibadan Expressway, 3km to Ojoo in Akinyele Local Government Area of Ibadan. The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Sector Commander in Oyo State, Mrs Uche Chukwurah confirmed the accident in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ibadan. Chukwurah said the accident involved a head-on collision between a truck and a petroleum tanker at the L. Adisa junction, 3kms to the Ojoo area of Ibadan. The Commander said five persons were involved in the accident in which two male adults died while one other person sustained injuries and the remaining two were unhurt. She said the suspected cause of the accident was speed violation and loss of control on the part of the truck. Chukwurah explained that there was road construction in progress at the beginning of the Ibadan -Oyo Expressway which led to vehicles using a single lane. The sector commander said corpses of the deceased passengers have been deposited at the Adeoyo Hospital morgue while the injured were taken to the University College Hospital, Ibadan, for medical attention. Chukwurah advised motorists to always obey speed limits and drive with caution on roads with ongoing construction to avoid mishaps.
