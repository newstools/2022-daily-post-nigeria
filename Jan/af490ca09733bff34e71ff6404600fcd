Manchester United captain, Harry Maguire has named the three Red Devils legends he wants to emulate at Old Trafford. Maguire said he wants to repeat the achievements of Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic at Man United, adding that he grew up idolizing the trio. The England defender stated this ahead of Man United’s FA Cup third round tie against Aston Villa on Monday night. “I grew up idolizing the likes of Wayne [Rooney], Rio [Ferdinand] and [Nemanja] Vidic and I want to repeat what they achieved,” Maguire said as quoted by Sportskeeda. “I’m privileged to be captain and I have got a responsibility to lead the players and turn things round.” Rooney, Ferdinand and Vidic were all part of Sir Alex Ferguson’s squad that won every available trophy for Man United. Rooney is Man United’s record goalscorer and has enjoyed several special moments at Old Trafford, while Vidic and Ferdinand formed one of the most successful and solid centre-back partnerships of the 21st century.
