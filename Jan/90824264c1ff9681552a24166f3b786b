Former Nigerian goalkeeper, Andrew Aikhoumogbe, has tipped the Super Eagles to go all the way to the final of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. Nigeria qualified for the round of 16 on Saturday after beating Sudan 3-1 in their second group game of the tournament. Aikhoumogbe stated that the team has shown the zeal to go all the way to the final by beating Egypt and Sudan. “I am really impressed with the performance of the Super Eagles against Sudan. There is this element of cohesion in the team which makes me feel so excited,” Aikhoumogbe, a former Golden Eaglets and Flying Eagles goalkeeper told Completesports. “This victory shows that the win against Egypt was not just a fluke but that the team played as a unit. I expect more of this performance in subsequent games because I believe they will go all the way to the final.”
