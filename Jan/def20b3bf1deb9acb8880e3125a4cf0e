The CAF Disciplinary Board, at the weekend, took disciplinary action against Ghana’s Benjamin Tetteh and Mali’s Bilal Toure. The continental football governing body also fined Gabon $20000. CAF took the decision following a meeting held on Saturday to deliberate on a number of incidents that occurred at the ongoing 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, in Cameroon. It disclosed this in a statement via its website on Saturday. The statement read in part, “CAF Disciplinary Board decided to: “To suspend Ghana player, Benjamin Tetteh, for one additional game match in addition to his automatic suspension of two matches. Consequently, the player has been suspended for three matches. “The Disciplinary Board has also issued a stern warning to both teams for their unsportsmanship behaviour after referees’ full-time whistle. “Mali Football Federation contested the red card awarded to their player, Bilal Toure in their AFCON fixture against Tunisia on 12 January 2022 in Limbe. “CAF Disciplinary Board upheld the decision of the referee. Consequently, Toure is suspended for two matches. “Gabon was charged with violating the CAF Regulations and Directives within the framework of the Africa Cup of Nations.
