Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has declared war on those involved in illegal oil bunkering in the state. The governor noted that those behind the illegal business were not poor people but a cartel and vowed to fight them until he leaves office. Wike made the vow when he led some government officials including the Commissioner of Police and other security chiefs to the forest of Ogbodo community in Ikwerre Local Government Area and the forest of Ibaa community in Emohua Local Government Area, to uncover some crude oil illegal refining sites. The governor said no one will be spared in the fight, adding that his administration will not succumb to any form of blackmail or sentiment that will be stirred in an attempt to frustrate efforts at curbing such hazardous business. He said “They can’t be doing this and killing my people. No reasonable government will allow that. And I can tell you with all due respect, we will take this matter very seriously. “Look at how, everyday, in your house, you see the soot. I mean, how can you allow that? So, this one that we can solve, we will solve it. “We have assured the people of Rivers State, we will fight this matter to the last until I leave office.” He directed State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Professor Zacchaeus Adangor, SAN, to take over the case files of illegal crude oil refinery operators arrested by the police. “Attorney General, all these matters with the police, you have to retrieve the files so that you can prosecute the matters on our own. I don’t want any compromise anywhere,” Wike warned.
