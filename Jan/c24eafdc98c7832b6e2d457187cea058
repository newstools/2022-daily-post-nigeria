Former captain of Nigeria national team, Kanu Nwankwo has tipped the current squad to go all the way and win the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. The Super Eagles began their quest for a fourth title in the best possible way, with a 1-0 win over favourites Egypt on Tuesday. Kelechi Iheanacho netted an outstanding winner in the 30th minute of the game. Kanu wrote on Instagram after the game: “Well done boys, that is how we do it. “One is gone, the game is coming. That is how we are going to do it, the same way and then winning. “The Cup is coming back.” Nigeria’s next Group D fixture is against Sudan on Saturday, while Egypt clash with Guinea-Bissau.
