A member of the Salvation Ministry, Ebimina Tamuno, has revealed that she cancelled her dream of becoming an internet fraudster after the founder of the church, Pastor Davide Ibiyeomie, rained curses on ‘Yahoo boys’. DAILY POST recalls that the popular pastor had, during a sermon in his church, laid curses on Nigerian youths who are into fraudulent activities, saying they will die by accident if they fail to repent. A few hours after the curses, Ebimina who had concluded plans to engage in cybercrime in a bid to better her life testified that she has given up on the plan. She said, “My name is Ebimina Tamuno. Yesterday, after Papa’s ministration, I was overwhelmed. I couldn’t sleep all through the night. “I was just waiting for the Glory Reign to be over and I have gotten all my documents ready to travel out to do ‘Yahoo Yahoo’. “Because the hardship is too much and I just wanted to have a good life and I feel that was going to make me okay. But I couldn’t sleep all through the night and I had to give it all up for God and I am here to give up. If I perish, I perish”.
