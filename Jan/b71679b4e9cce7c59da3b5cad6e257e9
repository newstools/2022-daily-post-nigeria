Some yet-to-be identified persons have stolen newly-installed streetlight cables in Ogun State, Governor Dapo Abiodun has lamented. Gov Abiodun disclosed on Sunday that the vandals had vandalised the poles and stolen cables of the new street lights along the Abeokuta-Siun-Sagamu road, saying he was planning to send a bill to the House of Assembly for punitive measures against vandals. Speaking during a church service to mark the 2022 Armed Forces Remembrance Day Celebration at the Cathedral Church of St. Peter, Ake, Abeokuta, the governor said, “Last night, we were coming from Ijebu-Ode and noticed that some parts of the lights were not on and on enquiry, we were told that some poles were vandalized and the cables stolen.” Abiodun, who was not happy with the ugly development, urged parents to warn their children and wards as he would not entertain any call or plea from any parent, whose child must have been arrested for any act of cultism, vandalism, banditry and others. “We will find them out and the full weight of the law would be brought upon them. We will make an example of them,” he threatened.
