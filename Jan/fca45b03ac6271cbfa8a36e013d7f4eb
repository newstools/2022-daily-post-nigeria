Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, has said he will take a decision on whether Anthony Martial will play against Brentford on Wednesday. The German however revealed that his disagreement with Martial over whether he was available to face Aston Villa is now “resolved”. Rangnick claimed after the 2-2 draw at Villa Park that the player “did not want” to be part of the squad for the game. Martial hit back at the manager on social media insisting he would never refuse to play. But after the two men spoke on Sunday, Rangnick said the Frenchman could play against Brentford in Wednesday’s Premier League game. “I’m here now for six weeks, all the things that needed to be said, I said after the press conference [at Villa],” Rangnick told a news conference on Tuesday. “I had a conversation with him on Sunday, a personal conversation with him about what happened and how I saw the whole situation, the matter is now resolved. “He didn’t train yesterday and the day before yesterday, he will probably train today [Tuesday] and after training then I will take the decision if he is nominated [for the squad] or not. Let’s see what will happen then.”
