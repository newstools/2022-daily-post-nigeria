Nollywood actress, Mercy Aigbe, has debunked claims that she snatched her new lover, Adeoti Kazim from his wife. DAILY POST had reported that the social media was agog after the actress shared loved up pictures of her new lover last weekend. Some Nigerians had also accused her of ‘stealing another woman’s happiness’ as it was revealed that Kazim is married with kids. However, Mercy, speaking to TVC ‘Your View’ on Wednesday, said her new lover is a Muslim who is entitled to more than one wife. She made this known in a message sent to the talk show host, Morayo Afolabi-Brown. “I spoke to her (Mercy) last night, she told me that the man is a Muslim, he’s entitled to more than one wife, so yes, he has issues with the first wife, and he is now married to her as the second wife and as a second wife, doesn’t she deserve to be happy? ” Morayo quoted Mercy as saying.
