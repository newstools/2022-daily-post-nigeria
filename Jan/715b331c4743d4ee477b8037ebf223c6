The Osun State Police Command, on Thursday, raised the alarm over “underground/nocturnal” plans by some residents of Igbaye to cause mayhem in respect of recent arrests made over the chieftaincy dispute in the community. The police, however, urged members of the community to be tolerant and not jeopardise the peaceful environment currently being enjoyed in the State. The State Commissioner of Police, Wale Olokode stated this in a statement issued by the Command’s Spokesperson, SP Yemisi Opalola, on Thursday. The police boss said the intelligence that availed the command revealed underground/nocturnal plans by some residents of Igbaye to cause mayhem in respect of recent arrests made over the chieftaincy tussle in the area. “To set the record straight that, on December 27, 2021, a distress call was received by Okuku Division that, there was a breakdown of law and order during the carnival organized by the Onigbaye of Igbaye, which led to loss of life, arson, destruction of properties and maiming of some residents. “Immediately the police received the report, detectives from Okuku Division and other tactical squads swung into action and arrested some suspects/hoodlums alleged to have carried out the nefarious act,” he said. Olokode noted that the crisis has no religious undertone or colouration. He, therefore, urged residents of the community to give peace a chance and advised all aggrieved members/parties to toe the path of peace by seeking redress in the court of law. The CP also warned residents of Igbaye to desist from such a plan as the State Police Command will do all within its constitutional powers to arrest and prosecute anyone found culpable.
