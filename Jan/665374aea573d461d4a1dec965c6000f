Shehu Sani, former Kaduna Central Senator, has reacted to calls by Arewa youths asking billionaire businessman, Aliko Dangote and those in the private sector to join the presidential race. Sani urged Dangote to ignore the youths and concentrate on completing his refinery. The Arewa Youth Assembly had urged some prominent Nigerians in the private sector to join the 2023 presidential race. The Northern youths said people like Dangote, Femi Otedola, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Mike Adenuga amongst others should contest for the presidency in 2023. They pointed out that these names have the managerial skills to rescue Nigeria from its current state. Reacting, Sani, in a tweet wrote: “Dear Dangote, ignore those northern youths dragging you to politics; concentrate on your refinery. Make work no come stop.”
