Chelsea striker, Romelu Lukaku is set for a shock move to join the club’s rivals Tottenham Hotspur. According to Gazzetta Dello Sport, Lukaku could seal a stunning cross-city switch to Tottenham in order to reunite with ex-Inter Milan boss, Antonio Conte. Lukaku faces an uncertain future at Chelsea after his recent explosive interview. The Belgium international had said he was not happy at Chelsea and made it clear that he is keen on returning to Inter Milan at some point in his career. He said Chelsea was only his fourth choice with Barcelona, Real Madrid, or Bayern Munich ahead of the Blues. The 28-year-old only returned to Chelsea last summer from Inter. He was not included in Chelsea’s squad that played 2-2 with Liverpool on Sunday. Lukaku will hold a meeting with Chelsea today [Monday] to decide his future at the club.
