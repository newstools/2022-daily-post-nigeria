English sports broadcaster and commentator, Sam Matterface has noted that Manchester United forward, Marcus Rashford is giving up on football already. Matterface suggested why the 24-year-old’s form has nosedived this season and cited his injuries, missed penalty in the Euro 2020 final, or the player’s campaign against the government as possible reasons for his declining performance. Rashford, who has consistently been one of Manchester United top performers in recent seasons, has struggled since he returned from injury and has been a shadow of his former self. The England international spent the 86 minutes on the pitch in Manchester United 1-0 win over Aston Villa in the FA Cup last night failing to make an impact for the Red Devils. “What is it? Because there’s something, he looks like he’s given up,” Matterface said on talkSPORT. “I’m looking at him and I feel sorry for him because he looks to me as if he’s carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders and he’s struggling mentally. “Maybe he’s struggling with the spotlight that has befallen him because of all of the off-the-field issues? “The missed penalty at the European Championships, maybe he didn’t really envisage that he would end up taking on the government as he did during the pandemic. “Maybe that has eventually taken its toll, but his football career is stalling.”
