Egypt superstar, Mohamed Salah, has made it clear they want to win the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. The Pharaohs have won the trophy for a record seven times, but Salah has won nothing with his country. The forward came close to lifting the trophy in 2017, but Egypt lost to Cameroon in the finals. After another disappointing outing on home soil in 2019, the Pharaohs head to Cameroon 2021, as one of the favourites. They face Nigeria in their Group D opener next week, before playing Sudan and Guinea-Bissau. Salah wrote (in Arabic) on Instagram: “The road is not easy, but we will fight to come back with the cup. Stay behind us #EncourageEgypt”. The Super Eagles have recorded eight wins and five draws in 18 games in all competitions against Egypt.
