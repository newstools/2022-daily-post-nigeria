The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has insisted that parties must respect dates for Ekiti, Osun Governorship Election Primaries and the commission’s timetable. The Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, spoke on Tuesday in Abuja, at the first quarterly meeting with parties. Yakubu advised leaders and aspirants to carry out transparent primaries and conduct themselves properly. INEC observed that parties had rescheduled their primaries multiple times and warned that the official schedule of activities should be not floured. He noted that in Ekiti, virtually all parties have decided to hold their primaries between January 26 to January 29, last 4 days allowed. Yakubu wondered why seven political platforms chose the last day for their primaries. “No party has submitted its list of aspirants, the composition of its electoral panel, or the register of members or list of delegates, depending on the chosen mode for electing its candidates. “Only one party has indicated the venue for its primaries. I urge you all to do so immediately to enable us to work out the detailed plans for monitoring the primaries.” Yakubu said primaries for electing candidates must take place in the constituency/states where election will be held as required by law. He declared that primaries conducted outside the two states will not be monitored by the commission and their outcomes rejected. The chairman said the warning also applies to primaries for bye-elections that may be held outside respective constituencies.
