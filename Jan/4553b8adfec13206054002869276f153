Bandits are demanding N50 million as ransom for the freedom of the wife and two daughters of a lecturer at the Federal College of Education (Technical) Gusau, Zamfara State, Dr Muazu Abdurrazak. Mohammed Jamilu, a family member of the victims, told DAILY POST that the bandits initially requested N100 million, but it was later reduced to N50 million. According to Mohammed Jamilu, negotiation is still ongoing with the bandits, explaining that the demand of N50 million is outrageous. Jamilu asked, “Where can we get that amount? It is too much for us. We are still negotiating with the bandits in order to rescue the three victims, who are all females.” DAILY POST recalls that the lecturer’s wife, Binta, and the two daughters, Maryam and Hafsat, were kidnapped at their house in Mareri village on the outskirts of Gusau town, around 1am on Friday.
