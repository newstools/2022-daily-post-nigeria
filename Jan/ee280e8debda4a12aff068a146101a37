Manchester United have made a late move to sign Ousmane Dembele from Barcelona, according to Footmercato. Man United are keen to sign Dembele after loaning out Anthony Martial to Sevilla, with Jesse Lingard and Donny van de Beek set to follow. However, Paris Saint-Germain have already verbally agreed to a deal with Barcelona to sign Dembele, but Man United have now made contact with the player’s entourage. Meanwhile, former Inter Milan midfielder, Christian Eriksen, is set to join Premier League club, Brentford, on a short-term deal until the end of the season after completing the necessary medical checks, the Sun reports. Eriksen underwent stringent medical exams in order to be given permission to return to the Premier League seven months after he had a cardiac arrest playing for Denmark at Euro 2020. His former club Inter Milan were forced to release him earlier this season because Serie A rules prevented the 29-year-old from playing with an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD), which was fitted following his collapse. Eriksen has played in the Premier League in the past during his time at Tottenham Hotspur.
