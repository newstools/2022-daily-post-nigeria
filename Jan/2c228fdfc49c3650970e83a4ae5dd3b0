Fire on Sunday razed at least 100 shops, including shanties, at the Ogbe-Ijoh Main Market in Warri South Local Government Area of Delta state. Property and goods worth millions of Naira were destroyed in the inferno. However, no casualty was recorded at the scene. An eyewitness, who sells tomatoes at a spot near the market, said the fire started at about 2pm. “I don’t know the cause of the fire. “I was selling my tomatoes here when I saw flames coming out from inside the market and people started rushing to the scene,” she said. One of the victims, who wept profusely, said she lost goods worth over N5 million in the fire. The victim, who pleaded anonymity, said she borrowed a lump sum of the money from a microfinance bank for her shop. “Where will I start from? How will I repay my debt? Government, please help me, I am dying,” she said, crying inconsolably. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that sympathisers, along with some of the traders in the market, were seen trying frantically to salvage some goods. Firefighters had a tough time trying to put out the fire, while police and Army personnel as well as Red Cross officials were also at the scene. The Secretary, Warri South Local Government Red Cross Division, Mr Cyril Kokarhaye, told newsmen that they were at the scene “to ensure normalcy”. “We’re yet to record any casualties and can’t ascertain the extent of the damage. “Our water truck has gone back again to refill,” Kokarhaye said.
