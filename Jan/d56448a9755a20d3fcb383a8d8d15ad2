Nigerian Actress, Juliana, popularly known as Toyosi in Jenifa’s diary has accused a pastor, Timi Adigun of sexually abusing her sister. Juliana had in an earlier post called out the pastor who was her ‘Spiritual father’ for taking control of her Facebook and other social media accounts. But in reaction, Adigun, who is the lead pastor of Mine Teens ministry, denied that he had the passwords to the social media accounts of the actress. In what seemed like a war of words between the pastor and Juliana in a three-part video on Instagram, the Pastor claimed he knows some secrets about the actress but would rather not expose her. The actress responded, asking him to expose her secrets even as she claimed that the pastor sexually abused and manipulated her sister. Her post read, “Your videos brought back memories, sad memories, painful memories, I have not been able to stop thinking about them, I cannot even sleep. Did you listen to yourself at all? I don’t think you did. “You manipulated and sexually abused my sister and you thought I would be calm, you expect me not to be furious, how are you processing the things you did and the things you said? I don’t understand you. “You talk about apology and forgiveness. Forgiving you is a process for me. I forgave you then, for my sanity, just when I am trying to move on, you do something else that triggers me and I get mad at you again and I beg God to help me forgive you again. “The hurt is really deep, the pain, the trauma, the disappointment, the sleepless nights, the tears that drenched my pillow, the shock, the entire experience is indescribable. Like I said, there is so much to say. I don’t have the words yet,” the actress said.
