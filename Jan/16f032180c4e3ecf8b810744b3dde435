Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, has released for payment the sum of N21 million allowance for the 2020/2021 Benue Law School Students. Barrister Martin Mue confirmed the payment on Thursday, January 6, 2022, while speaking on Day Break Benue, a Benue Television Breakfast show. He said law students of 2020/2021 who attended the school have been paid their allowances. He also applauded the payment process describing it as transparent, efficient and without stress. Barr Mue said even as it is not possible for all the students to meet the Governor, which they would have loved to, they all appreciated the governor for keeping to his promise. He urged the governor to sustain his support for students of the State who are undergoing studies in different academic disciplines across the country and beyond.
