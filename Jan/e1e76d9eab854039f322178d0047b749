The Ogoni people have declared that any Ogoni man or woman who seeks the position of deputy governor in 2023 will be seen as an enemy of Ogoniland. The group, known as Vanguard of Ogoni Nation, said Ogoni people will not settle for anything less than the office of the Rivers governor in 2023. The leader of the group, Reuben Favour, described the position of the deputy governor as a spare tyre that has no voice and authority. He said the time they wanted the position has passed, insisting that they only want the position of Governor. Favour said, “What will the deputy governor do to Ogoni people now? A deputy governor is just a spare tyre. He has no voice and authority. He has nothing. “What we are going for now is for an Ogoni man to be the Governor of Rivers State. “Any Ogoni man that is going for the position of deputy governor should see himself as an enemy of Ogoni people. Ogoni people cannot play the second fiddle.” The Ogoni leader also vowed that the people will work against the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) if they fail to give their governorship ticket to Ogoni people. “If APC or PDP do not give their ticket to Ogoni people, we will make sure that we will work against them in all the positions including the National and state assembly,” he said. The latest declaration by the group follows the latest permutations that one of the two major political parties may be planning to zone the deputy governorship position to Ogoniland. It may interest you to know that no Ogoni man has, until now, declared interest in the governorship position.
