I have not closed my eyes to sleep since yesterday. “My driver and I were attacked by armed robbers at Arepo where I went to film while in traffic on our way back home yesterday “They broke my windscreens, left my whole body with wounds and skin in pain because of the impact of the shattered glass which was forcefully broken while I was in the car. “My arm was cut with cutlass, and they took my phones, belongings and ran off! Sadly my driver also took a hit to his head. The actress went ahead to lament the increasing level of insecurity under President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. “I also experienced the highly poor insecurity state in Nigeria which has become a norm.
