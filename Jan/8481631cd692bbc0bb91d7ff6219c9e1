The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) has called for calm in Burkina Faso. President Roch Marc Christian Kabore is under detention by mutinous soldiers, led by Lt-Col Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba. They swooped in after talks with Defence Minister, General Barthelemy Simpore failed to yield a positive result. The military personnel cited “government failure” to support them during a deadly insurgency as one of the reasons. Kabore’s ouster commenced on Sunday with gunshots near his residence in the capital, Ouagadougou. In a statement on Tuesday, the OIC expresses its concern about developments in the West African nation. The General Secretariat appealed to the Burkinabe military to prioritize the spirit of dialogue and responsibility to resolve any problem. “The OIC supports the Government and people of Burkina Faso in their efforts towards security and stability in Burkina Faso”, it said. The body consists of 57 countries and a population of two billion; 49 member states are Muslim-majority. Africa has now recorded mutiny in four countries – Mali, Guinea, Sudan, Burkina Faso – since August 2020.
