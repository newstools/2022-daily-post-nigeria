Thousands of residents from Okokomaiko in Ojo Local Government Area and environs have benefitted from an empowerment programme organized by the Olawale Aganga-Williams Foundation. They thronged the venue, Starjen International Hotel, after mobilization by officials and ward members of Ojo LGA and Ojo Federal Constituency.  The participants included nursing mothers, widows, young adults and the aged. Hon. Olawale Aganga-Williams, who is concerned about the welfare of Ojo constituency where he hails from, said OAW Foundation was created to give succour to the people. Noting that he is passionate about their wellbeing, the founder expressed his wish for Nigeria to be secure and poverty-free.  “The desire to impact and give back to the community birthed the Olawale Aganga-Williams Foundation, a non-profit and non-governmental organization. “The main objectives are to empower communities, provide trainings for skills acquisition, jobs for those unemployed, education for children and youths and scholarships for the underprivileged. “At OAW Foundation, we are assisting people to live better. We are also supporting men and women with the right skills that would make them employable and become employers of labor”, he added.  Aganga-Williams believes the initiative would further help to alleviate hardship which would ultimately lead to Nigeria’s economic growth. Mrs Kudirat Alimi, one of the beneficiaries of food palliatives, commended OAW Foundation’s efforts. The petty trader and mother of two said they had looked forward to pipe-borne water and scholarships being provided to young people. Alimi thanked Aganga-Wiliams for his gesture, saying the residents expect the fulfillment of promises on poverty alleviation.  Anita Udoh-Ojo, a young widow, revealed that she lost her husband to the cold hands of armed robbers in 2021. She appealed to the foundation to further support her with funds to take care of her baby and business.
