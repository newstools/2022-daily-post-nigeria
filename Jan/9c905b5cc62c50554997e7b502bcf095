Operatives of the Agro Ranger Unit of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps(NSCDC), Kwara State Command, on Saturday, prevented what could have been a bloody clash between farmers and herders in the Alapa community of Asa Local Government Area of Kwara State. Spokesman of the NSCDC in the state, Babawale Zaid Afolabi, disclosed that the Agro Ranger Unit of the corps got a distress call from the Alapa community and promptly deployed officers to the scene of the incident. “On Saturday 08/01/2022, based on a distress call from Alapa community in Asa local government area of the state our able Commandant Makinde Iskil Ayinla, directed the immediate deployment of the operatives of the Agro Ranger Unit to the location and their timely arrival put the situation under control,” Babawale disclosed He explained further that a farmer, Alaparo Tunde and his two sons, Saheed Tunde and Taofeek Tunde, from Alaparo village, confronted a Fulani herder, Haruna Adamu, who was caught grazing on their cassava plantation with his cattle. The confrontation later resulted in a hot argument with the Fulani and farmers engaged in a bloody fight where cutlasses and other dangerous weapons were freely used. Both Fulani herder and the farmer’s two sons were seriously injured and were later taken to a nearby hospital where they are responding to treatment. Security has been beefed up in the community while full-scale investigations are ongoing to unravel the immediate and remote cause of the incident and how to prevent any act of reprisal.
