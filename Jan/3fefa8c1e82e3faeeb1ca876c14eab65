A fire outbreak has destroyed one of the mega schools rehabilitated by Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State in Maiduguri. The mega school was recently commissioned by President Muhammadu Buhari during his visit to Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, about seven months ago. The school is located at Goni Kachallari, beside Muhammed Goni College of Agriculture along Custom Muna Expressway. Despite efforts by firefighters and some Chinese contractors working on some projects around the school, the fire is still raging.
