The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, MACBAN, has insisted it is not a terrorist organization. MACBAN’s National Secretary, Baba Ngelzarma, said the Federal Government should shun the call to proscribe the group. Recall that the Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom had urged the Federal Government to declare MACBAN, Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore and FUNAB as terrorist groups. But Ngelzarma maintained that MACBAN has contributed to peacebuilding in the state. In a statement he signed, the MACBAN Secretary noted that the group has spared no effort in helping the people of the state to live in peace with the pastoralists. According to Ngelzarma: “We are not at all surprised at the recent call by Gov. Samuel Ortom of Benue State for the proscription of our association (MACBAN) going by his antecedents, whose stock in trade is fanning the embers of hatred between peaceful Nigerians that have been living in peace for many centuries. “We, therefore, call on the federal government to ignore this unpatriotic call by a wayward governor who is hell-bent on putting this country into unnecessary crisis. “MACBAN is not and will never be a terrorist organization. “We are fully registered with the regulatory agencies with clear vision and mission to foster peaceful coexistence to our teeming members as well as serving humanity positively.”
