Nigeria continued their preparation for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations with a 2-0 win over Coton Spot in a friendly match on Friday. The Super Eagles made light work of the warm-up game against the 1-time Cameroonian champions. Interim boss, Austin Eguaoven, put out two different teams in each half. Maduka Okoye started in goal in the first half, while Ola Aina and Zaidu Sanusi were the fullbacks. William Troost-Ekong and Kenneth Omeruo partnered each other in the heart of the defence. Wilfred Ndidi, Joe Aribo and Kelechi Iheanacho played in a three-man midfield, with Chidera Ejuke and Ahmed Musa operating on the flanks. Union Berlin striker Taiwo Awoniyi led the line. Musa’s goal gave the Super Eagles a half-time lead. In the second half, Francis Uzoho was in goal, while Olisa Ndah and Semi Ajayi were the centre backs alongside Chidozie Awaziem. Frank Onyeka, Kelechi Nwakali and Alex Iwobi played from the middle of the park while Moses Simon, Samuel Chukwueze flanked Sadiq Umar up front. The second half also produced one goal for the Super Eagles, which came via the boots of Chukwueze. Nigeria begin their quest to win a fourth title against Egypt on Tuesday.
