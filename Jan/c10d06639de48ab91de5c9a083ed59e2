The Ebonyi State Government has warned residents of the state against obeying the sit-at-home order by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), ahead of its leader, Nnamdi Kanu’s court outing. Nwachukwu Eze, the state’s Commissioner for Markets and Parks, warned that residents who obey the sit-at-home would be severely punished. Recall that IPOB’s spokesperson, Emma Powerful, had announced the sit-at-home for Tuesday in protest of Kanu’s continued trial. Kanu’s trial before Justice Binta Nyako-led Federal High Court Abuja continues on Tuesday. However, the Commissioner directed that all markets and parks in the state should be open for business or their leaders should be prepared to face “severe punishment”. According to Eze, “All markets and parks leaderships in Ebonyi are by this announcement directed to ensure that markets are open for businesses on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. “The state is not in any way part of the sit-at-home order by IPOB. Please note that strict compliance to this directive is very important as failure to do so will attract severe punishment.”
