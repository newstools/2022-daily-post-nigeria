Eintracht Frankfurt defender, Almamy Toure, is being linked with a move to join Jose Mourinho’s AS Roma. According to Calciomercato, Roma are looking at Toure as an alternative signing in case they fail to land Arsenal’s Ainsley Maitland-Niles in the January transfer window. Frankfurt may be willing to let Toure depart the club for Roma if the Giallorossi submits an offer within the region of €8 million. Toure was part of France’s under 21, but for a year, he ended up on the bench. The 25-year-old has played just three games as a starting player for Frankfurt in the Bundesliga this season. Apart from Toure, Roma have been linked with a move for Chelsea’s Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Manchester United’s Charlie Wellens in the past.
