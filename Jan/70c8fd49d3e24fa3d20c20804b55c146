Publicity Secretary, Kennedy Peretei, said the former two term governor is not only a senior citizen in the state but also in the country. Peretei emphasised that the return of Mimiko to the PDP was orchestrated by four PDP governors who were led Aminu Tambuwal, Governor of Sokoto State and Chairman, PDP Governors’ Forum. “The State Working Committee noted that the action of Bode Obanla is a great embarrassment to the party and necessary actions will be taken in due course.” The party in also added that Obanla’s action was a mere distraction that should be ignored.
