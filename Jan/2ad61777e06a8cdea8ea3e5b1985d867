Former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has asked three players to leave the club if they “love” their profession. They are Anthony Martial, Dean Henderson and Donny van de Beek. Interim United boss, Ralf Rangnick, has already admitted there are unhappy players in his squad. Teden Mengi, Ethan Laird and Axel Tuanzebe have all left Old Trafford this month on loan. Henderson, 24, has only made one appearance this season and finds himself behind David de Gea in the goalkeeping pecking order. Van de Beek is yet to make a start in the Premier League this season and the 24-year-old midfielder. Martial has scored just once in 10 appearances and the 26-year-old is linked with a move to Newcastle. Berbatov told Betfair: “I’m not surprised to see that Dean Henderson has handed in a transfer request, I was expecting it. Same for Donny van de Beek and Anthony Martial. “These players aren’t playing and it’s clear they aren’t happy and as long as they love what they do, playing football, they should move.”
