The Spiritual Director of the Adoration Ministry Enugu, Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka has predicted that the corporate existence of the country may come to an end if the north retains power in the forthcoming 2023 general elections. Speaking during a sermon at the adoration ground in Enugu State, the popular Catholic priest warned President Muhammadu Buhari against planning to hand over power to the north. According to Mbaka, the Northerners should forget about leadership in the coming political era, saying there may be a disaster if the north tries to impose the next President on Nigerians.

He said, “The issue of after Buhari, the North should lead again, President Buhari should better plan well and hand over to the South, but if the north wants to take over, this country will collapse. “There may be no Nigeria again if the President, because of whatever, tries to hand over power back to the north. After Buhari, the Northerners should forget about leadership in this coming political era. “If they try to make a northerner next President, disaster will happen, going forward will be impossible, going back will be a dream. Anyhow they want to do the political maneuvering, they should make sure that justice prevails. “The spirit of the Lord has asked me to say this because they have what it takes to plant a northerner. Buhari should remember that Nigerians trusted him when he came in and he should remember that one day, he is leaving that place.”
