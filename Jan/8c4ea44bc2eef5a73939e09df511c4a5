Borussia Dortmund striker, Erling Haaland, has named Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk as the toughest defender he has ever played against. Haaland has faced off against some of the world’s best in his short career for both club and country. The 21-year-old has met Van Dijk three times and failed to win any of the games. He lost twice during his time at Red Bull Salzburg in the Champions League and most recently, a World Cup qualifying draw with Norway in which he bagged a goal. “You know how tall he is, how strong he is and how fast he is, and also the timing is crazy. “I don’t think I won one duel against him because he’s a physical monster,” Haaland said in an interview with ESPN.
