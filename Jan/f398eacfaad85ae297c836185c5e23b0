The Oyo State chapter of SWAN in its reaction, said that journalists in the State would miss the former GM. SWAN Chairman, Mr. Niyi Alebiosu, and the Secretary, Mr. Adewale Tijani, in a statement sent to DAILY POST on Friday, lamented that the death of Balogun has robbed Nigeria’s football the fraternity of an experienced football administrator. The duo said, “Balogun’s death is a colossal loss not only to 3SC but to the entire football fraternity in Nigeria. Even we, journalists will miss him sorely. He was our friend, our father, and our adviser. Balogun related with us very well and made our work very easy for us. It’s sad we lost him”. The association lamented further that Balogun died at a time his wealth of experience was needed mostly by the 3SC. It stated that the club needed Balogun in order to weather the storm of Nigerian league presently threatening to drown the recently promoted club. “His death at this time is unfortunate. It’s so painful that we lost Balogun now. He shouldn’t have died now, not at this time when we need him to use his skills and experience to paddle away the troubled canoe of 3SC to safety. “We’re very sad, but who are we to question the Almighty God who gives and takes life? God knows why he left at this time. May Allah forgive him his shortcomings and grant him eternal rest,” they added.
