Nigerian defender, William Troost-Ekong, has said that the Super Eagles will approach their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, tie against Sudan the same way they did against Egypt. Nigeria will face Sudan in their second AFCON fixture at the Stade Roumdé Adjia Stadium, Garoua, on Saturday. Augustine Eguavoen’s side had defeated Egypt 1-0 in their first game on Tuesday. Speaking with NAN after their session on the training pitch at the Stade Roumdé Adjia, the Watford star assured that there would be no room for complacency in the game against Sudan this weekend. Troost-Ekong said: “The whole team defended very well and they [Egypt] didn’t have many chances and I think we played some nice game of football, which is always exciting. “Having said that, I don’t think we should believe in the hype going into the game against Sudan. Every game for us is going to be a big game. “We are going to approach it the same way we did against the Egyptians. Game by game, we are going to go further. “So, we will keep cool and stay humble as we have got all it takes to get over the Sudanese.” The kick-off time for Nigeria vs Sudan game is 5 pm.
