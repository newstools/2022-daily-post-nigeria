Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, has explained why he made Cristiano Ronaldo captain against Wolves on Monday. Rangnick also explained why he started Phil Jones in Man United’s Premier League tie against Wolves at Old Trafford. Man United faces Wolves at home in their first Premier League game of 2022, but they will be without injured captain Harry Maguire after the centre-back sustained an injury in their last game against Burnley. With Victor Lindelof still testing positive for COVID-19 and Eric Bailly set to link up with the Ivory Coast squad at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, Rangnick decided to start Jones, who partnered Raphael Varane, and made Ronaldo captain against Wolves. Explaining his decision, Rangnick told MUTV before Man United’s kick-off against Wolves: “From what I have seen so far he [Jones] was extremely professional all the time, even when he was not in the squad, since last night our two other centre backs were out, he was the logical choice. “Victor was still positive, it was clear since yesterday morning he would be out. “Harry had that knock on his chest against Burnley, we thought he would be good but yesterday it was impossible, he had too much pain when he was standing around and sitting, it was clear it was impossible to play.” Speaking on Ronaldo, who captains Man United for the first time since his return to the club last summer from Juventus, Rangnick added, “The question was is it David or him [Ronaldo], these are the players who have been playing for the longest period of time and I wanted a field player as captain which is why I chose Cristiano.”
