Evangelist Fumilayo Adebayo, nicknamed Mummy G.O’s hellfire meme, has explained why she said that many people, including footballers, women who do makeup, and those who don’t cover their hair inside Church would go to hellfire. Mummy G.O had claimed many people are going to hellfire for playing football, doing makeup, watching comedy, including other reasons. Mummy G.O, in one of the clips, also claimed that she had been a virgin all her life, despite having had a premarital sexual relationship and given birth to children. However, speaking on the development, in an interview with BBC Pidgin, Mummy G.O said, “Yes [I said women who do makeup would go to hellfire] because go to other religion, even the Muslim there is something we call modest, I have travelled to many Muslim countries you would never see any of the Muslim women wear anything that would open their body. “I have said it before, even in their dress. You will know that they fear God. Fifty years ago, no woman would enter Church without covering her hair. “The God that didn’t allow any woman to enter Church without covering her hair that God has traveled or changed? No woman will enter the mosque without covering her hair. “I said many footballers will not make heaven because of the event that is about to come that will introduce the antichrist into the world and it will come through the World Cup.”
