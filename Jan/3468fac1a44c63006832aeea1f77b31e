The Chairman of Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Governor of Yobe state, Mai Mala Buni has declared that the national convention of the party will be held on February 26. The announcement of the date is coming after weeks of immense pressure on the committee to announce a date and venue for the party’s convention. Buni made the announcement Tuesday in Abuja at the National Progressives Women Conference, where he charged the women to participate actively in the party’s convention and the next general election. Despite the announcement, Buni maintained a grave-yard silence on the venue of the convention. The chairman emphasized that women constitute a large proportion of Nigeria’s population with a good number of them making the nation proud. He said: “You remain the best mobilizers of support to any political party and its candidates. You have always been there in the queue on election days to determine the fate of candidates. With this, we are confident of winning the 2023 general with huge success. “Let me assure you that the party shall not forget this gesture by supporting women and youths for their political aspirations. And to realize their political dreams. We look forward to having more women contesting in the forthcoming National Convention of the party on February 26th, 2022, and the general elections.” “Now, as we approach the convention and move closer to the next general election, l wish to remind you of your progressive role in supporting progressive-minded leaders,” he said.
