The Osun Progressives (TOP), a caucus of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State has debunked the ongoing rumour that it has aligned itself with the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Earlier on Monday, a video was circulated on social media where the Osun State PDP chairman, Sunday Bisi had stated that the PDP was a friend of the TOP caucus. In a statement signed by the Chairman, Adelowo Adebiyi and made available to DAILY POST on Monday, Adebiyi maintained that there was no need for an alliance with the PDP or any other party in the State since the caucus was sure of victory within the party before and after the July 16, 2022, gubernatorial election. The TOP chairman while calling on members of the public to disregard any insinuation that it was working for the PDP, added that their hearts and souls were fully with the APC. He also informed the PDP that despite the current crisis within their fold, working with them was a wishful thinking because they were progressives to the core and would not betray their ideology. Adebiyi, who had accused the IleriOluwa caucus of the Party of circulating the video for mischievous aims, said that the circulation of the video was a failed attempt to maliciously link TOP with the PDP.
