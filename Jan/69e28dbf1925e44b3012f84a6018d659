Former Nigeria international, Emmanuel Amuneke has said it will be difficult to predict who will win the 33rd Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. Amuneke feels the standard of football on the continent has improved since the last edition in Egypt. He, however, admitted that defending champions Algeria are hot favourites to defend their title. Amuneke, who won the trophy in 1994, also listed Senegal, Egypt, Nigeria, Tunisia, Morocco and hosts Egypt. “Algeria is the reigning champions, and they are the favourites. Senegal is a very strong team. So are the hosts Cameroon, Egypt, Nigeria, Morocco and Tunisia. “It will be very difficult to predict who will win the title. “There are big changes in African football, players with a global dimension, it is promising. “In Europe today, African footballers play the leading roles in their clubs and evolve in the top clubs in the world,” Amuneke told CAFOnline. The 2021 AFCON kicks off tomorrow and the winner will be decided on February 6.
