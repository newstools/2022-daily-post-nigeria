The All Progressives Congress (APC) will face a “serious challenge” in 2023, according to a member, Victor Lar. Lar represented Plateau South Senatorial District in the National Assembly between 2011 and 2015. Advocating adequate preparation for next general elections, he mentioned ex-Borno Governor, Ali Modu Sheriff, as the best national chairmanship aspirant. Lar commented on the February 26 convention in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday. “The APC will face a peculiar challenge in 2023 because President Muhammadu Buhari, known to have galvanised over 12 million votes consistently, will not be on the ballot. “This will create a serious challenge whereby the party will need to navigate very carefully so as to succeed,” he said. Lar noted that the next chairman must be able to mobilize and unite all interests to ensure victory at federal and state levels. The former Senator listed the major blocs as the presidency, governors, national assembly and party leadership. Lar said Sheriff understands all due to his experience as a former legislator, governor and party chief. The politician reminded the APC that to continue to enjoy acceptability, there must be innovative and strong executives.
