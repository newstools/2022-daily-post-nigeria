Yoruba group, Ilana Omo Oodua has lambasted the lawyer to Sunday Adeyemo a.k.a. Igboho over his letter to President Muhammadu Buhari. A statement on Sunday by Maxwell Adeleye said Olajengbesi does not speak for Igboho nor is involved in the Yoruba Nation self-determination struggle. The spokesman said the work he was “hired and paid for” ended with his defence of Igboho’s aides and relations arrested by the Department of State Services (DSS) on July 1, 2021, in Ibadan, Oyo State. “Anything Olajengbesi says afterwards should be considered as his personal opinion and not that of Ighoho. As our Lawyer, he is supposed to speak to the public on our instruction”, he noted. Adeleye put on record that the legal practitioner made it clear in an interview that he is not interested in Yoruba Nation agitation because he believes in one Nigeria. He said Olajengbesi affirmed that his only interest was to defend oppressed people humiliated by the Nigerian government “which he has meritoriously executed for us”. “We are surprised that Olajengbesi wrote a new year message to President Muhammad Buhari on behalf of Ighoho, lobbied the Nigerian Government indirectly, while he attempted to paint the image of a surrendered Ighoho. “We want to state very expressly that the so-called new year message is a personal opinion of Pelumi Olajengbesi and not the position of Chief Ighoho”, the statement added.
