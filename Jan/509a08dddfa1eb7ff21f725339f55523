Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, on Friday, advised Nigerian youths to focus on value and create wealth. He gave the counsel during induction into the Northern Youth Council of Nigeria Hall of Fame as ‘Garkuwan Matasan Najeriya’ (Shield of the Nigerian Youth). Speaking after his decoration, the former Osun Governor hailed young citizens for their ability to recognize the need for mentorship and leaders to copy. “I advised that the Nigerian Youth must focus on value creation. If 60m Nigerian youths can create a value of N100,000 monthly, that is N6trillion Monthly and N72trillion Annually”, he said. The minister noted that this way, the people would be able to permanently banish poverty from the nation. Aregbesola assured that President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration would ensure the enabling environment for productivity and creativity. “The Nigerian youth possess the capacity to turn around the fortune of our country and the entire black race,” he added.
