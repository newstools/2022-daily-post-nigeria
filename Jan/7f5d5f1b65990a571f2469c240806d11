Pep Guardiola has named Kevin De Bruyne as the world-class player in the Manchester City team. The Spanish manager said De Bruyne’s parents have to be proud for having such a humble star, who has everything and yet is humble. The Spaniard also challenged De Bruyne to harness his world-class talent to continue to propel the club to win more silverware. The Belgium international netted the only goal when Pep Guardiola’s side piped Chelsea 1-0 at the Etihad on Saturday. The win also means that Manchester City is now 13 points ahead of Chelsea in the Premier League table. “He has been with me here from day one,” Guardiola told BT Sport. “Everything we have won we have won together. I am going to push him to keep on doing more and more. “He’s a world-class player who has humility and is humble, it is not easy to find that. He was Player of the Year in this country. He won the team three Premier League and a lot of prizes and still has this [performance] to give. But I want more, I want more because I know he can do it. He has everything. “His mum and dad have to be so proud.”
