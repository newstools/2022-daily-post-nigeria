US-based Nigerian music executive, Akeju Abass has reacted to the recent rift between Nigerian music superstar, Burna Boy, and Ghanaian star, Shatta Wale. The Ghanaian music artiste had, during a live concert in Ghana, accused his Nigerian counterparts of not loving and supporting them. Popular singer, Wizkid had also weighed into the comparison between Nigerian artistes and Ghanaian artiste, saying that both sides are just the same. However, Ghana artiste, Stonebwoy had said that although Shatta Wale’s approach may be wrong, his message is valid. Shatta Wale had thrown a shade at Nigerian artistes after selling out the Accra Sports Stadium for his concert. At the concert, he boasted that he did not need Nigerian musicians to fill up the biggest stadium in Ghana. Akeju, who recently launched Faces of Afrobeats, a campaign to celebrate African artists, urged stars from both countries to look at the positive side of building peace and a united Africa. “The recent rift between Ghanaian and Nigerian stars is really disappointing. Music is one of Africa’s biggest exports. We have international spotlight on us. This is time to preach peace and shouldn’t allow any form of disunity set in”, he told DAILY POST. The faces of Afrobeats campaign has featured some notable African stars like, Grammy-award winner Angélique Kidjo, Burna Boy, Davido, Shatta Wale, Flavour, Psquare, Diamond Platnumz, Wizkid, Sarkodie, R2Beez, Simi, Yemi Alade and many others. Akeju, while highlighting the impact of African music on the global stage, added that Afrobeats has gained lots of positive reviews amongst music lovers. “Our artists are gaining international recognition. Almost everywhere you go in America, there’s a playlist for African songs. This is really encouraging and we must learn to appreciate them”, he said.
