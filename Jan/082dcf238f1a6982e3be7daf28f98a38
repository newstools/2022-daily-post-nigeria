Bola Tinubu, a 2023 presidential aspirant, has said President Muhammadu Buhari has the ability to crush Boko Haram and bandits ravaging the North. He, however, claims that insurgents and other criminal elements can only be eliminated through a commitment from Nigerians. Tinubu made the claims during his visit to the Governor of Zamfara State, Bello Matawalle in Gusau, the state capital, on Thursday. The All Progressives Congress, APC, National Leader was in Gusau to commiserate with the governor over the recent killings in the state. Last week, about 200 people were killed when bandits raided some villages in Bukkuyum and Anka Local Government Areas of the state. However, Tinubu said, “I could offer prayers for the people from anywhere, but coming in person is important. The enemies of knowledge, Boko Haram and other criminal elements will be defeated through a commitment to humanity. “We pray for the entire country to be stable and if the enemies refuse to stop the carnage, we shall eliminate them. “We believe in President Muhammadu Buhari’s ability to restore law and order and bring back our country to stability and tracks of development.”
