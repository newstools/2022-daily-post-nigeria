A socio-political group in the South-west region, Yoruba Ronu Leadership Forum (YRLF), has opined that 2023 is the turn of the Igbo of the South East to produce the President of the country. Mr Akin Malaolu, its President, in a statement explained that the forum would not be tricked into supporting any other presidential aspiration other than that of the SouthEast- region. According to the forum, the declaration of the former Lagos State governor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu for the 2023 presidency, is a trouble-making adventure, saying that it recognized the right of the APC National leader to pursue his ambition. The statement titled, “Tinubu’s Presidential Ambition is a Trouble-making Adventure”, stated that it is no longer a speculation that Asiwaju Bola Tinubu is interested in becoming the next president of Nigeria come 2023. It added that it was within his right as a Nigerian to go for it but that for the purpose of further clarity, “it sees Tinubu’s visit to the President as a troublemaking misstep purposely to create an impact that may unbalance the present drivers of the party, the progressive governors’ forum and enlarge the fault lines already visible and to midwife a division within. ” According to the statement, “This attitude is uncalled for, particularly from any democrat that is worthy of being a member of an association and at a time the nation is looking for peace.” It stated that the presidential interest from any tribe other than from the Igbos may take the nation into a deeper political trouble that may set the nation ablaze if care was not taken. As leaders of thought in the South-west, the forum said it had taken inventory of conditions in the diversity of the country and their findings convinced them that the fate of the vast people and ethnic nationalities across Nigeria could only be made well if Nigerians rotate the office of the president amongst themselves. It pleaded with the leaders, mostly in the south, not to play the “traitor role”, stressing that it had taken a position to support Igbo presidency come 2023 and that there was no going back.
