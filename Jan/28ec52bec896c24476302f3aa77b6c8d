The All Progressives Congress has assured that the satanic killings of innocent Nigerians in Zamfara villages by terrorists won’t go unpunished. The party expressed its heartfelt condolences to the families that lost loved ones and also commiserated with the government and people of the state. The National Secretary of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the party, Sen. John Akpanudoedehe, said this in a statement issued Monday, where he assured Nigerians that banditry and insurgency would be crushed. He said the President Muhammadu Buhari government has been steadfast in retooling the armed forces, recruitment of personnel and intensified training to enhance their operational capacity in safeguarding public safety and the territorial integrity of the country. Akpanudoedehe said, “The All Progressives Congress (APC) is deeply pained and condemns the recent killings of innocent Nigerians in their villages in Zamfara State by criminal gangs also known as bandits. “Indeed, the recent designation of these satanic, evil and criminal elements as terrorist groups will further buoy our security services to deal with them as such and ultimately contain their nefarious activities in the country.” The ruling party commended the military and other security services whose concerted onslaught on the camps of the criminals is ensuring the rescue of kidnapped citizens and neutralising the criminal elements. The secretary stressed that already, the terrorists are now fleeing as troops’ clearance operations have forced their dislodgement from their enclaves.
