The Arewa Youths Consultative Forum, AYCF, has cautioned Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, against vying for the Presidency in 2023. Yerima Shettima, National President of AYCF, said Nigeria needs younger and vibrant leaders to saddle the country’s leadership position. Speaking with DAILY POST, Shettima, who described Tinubu as kingmaker, noted that kingmakers don’t become kings; hence he should jettison the idea. He urged the former Lagos State governor to play an advisory role in moving Nigeria forward rather than becoming the president. According to Shettima: “We need more younger and vibrant elements to champion or pilot the affairs of the country, so it’s wrong for the likes of him (Tinubu) that is supposed to be in the background to start yearning on coming back to rule the country. “We can’t expect to continue doing one thing the same way and expect to get a different result, nobody is happy with the way this country is, so I expect the likes of him to play advisory roles on how the country should move forward. “He has been a kingmaker, and in most cases, a kingmaker can’t become a king; that is the natural aspect of it. “However, it will be better if he yields to advise and do the needful, but nobody would deprive him of contesting because it’s within his constitutional right, but Nigerians will decide at the ballot. “In 2023, we are going to work on competency, and anybody can contest; whoever feels they want to contest should come up with their best 11, and we will come forward with us in the North, and Nigerians will decide.” Tinubu had last week informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his intention to run for the Presidency in 2023. The APC National Leader had informed the president that running for the Presidency was his lifelong aspiration.
