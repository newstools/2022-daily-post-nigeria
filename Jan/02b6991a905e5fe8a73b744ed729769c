Manchester United legend, Gary Neville, has snubbed Cristiano Ronaldo and named Wayne Rooney and Ruud van Nistelrooy as his two ‘certainties’ for success at the Red Devils. Neville has been critical of Ronaldo since his return to Manchester United last summer from Juventus and he has opted not to name the Portugal captain as one of the players he was certain would succeed at Old Trafford. The former defender believes Rooney and Van Nistelrooy are the players that he knew would have successful careers at Man United and opted not to mention Ronaldo. Speaking on a transfer special for Sky Sports, Neville said: “There were two certainties. “The one who I already knew was Wayne Rooney. It was not even a risk, you just knew he would be absolutely unbelievable. “Even though we had to wait for him to make his debut because he was injured, I never thought it would be a risk. “The first time I watched him in training, he did a shooting session and hit one and I went, ‘woah, you can’t kick a ball like that’. “Sometimes you see things in training and just think to yourself, ‘that is a proper player’. “That was Ruud. He was the one who I didn’t know beforehand that I looked at straightaway in training and thought he was unbelievable.” Neville spent his entire career with Man United, making 400 league appearances over the course of 18 years. He won eight Premier League titles, two Champions League and three FA Cup.
