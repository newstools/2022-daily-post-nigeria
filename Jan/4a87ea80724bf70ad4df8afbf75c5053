When Anietie’s brother who was inside the house saw what happened he started shouting for help.” He added that some youths arrived at the scene and caught the two Hausa scrap collectors and when information filtered that Anietie was on the way to the hospital, the angry youths immediately beat the scrap collectors into the gutter and immediately set them ablaze before the arrival of the police.
