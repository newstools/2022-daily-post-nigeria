A correctional officer, Orbert Bawa Ma’aji, was on Friday shot dead by gunmen wearing military uniforms in Kaduna. The deceased was reportedly shot dead around the Gonin Gora area on his way from his Abuja duty station. Orbert, who sat on the front passenger seat, died instantly while the driver survived with injuries. A source told DAILY POST that the killers, who were on two motorbikes, opened fire on the car from behind at close range. Family sources who confirmed the incident explained that they are still gathering the information, adding that the victim was coming to Kaduna for the weekend before he was killed. They revealed that the driver had been rushing to the train station in Rigasa to pick up his boss who was to arrive by rail. Another source alleged that they were chased and shot at by armed military men for disobeying a long hold-up caused by a military checkpoint around Olam farm on Abuja-Kaduna highway around 4:00 pm on Friday. The deceased has three children and a pregnant wife who is also a correctional officer serving in Kaduna. Efforts to get the Director, Army Public Relations Officer in Kaduna proved abortive as he did not respond when contacted on phone.
