A 14-year-old housemaid identified as Favour Iwuozor has abducted her mistress’s two-year-old son, with a plan to take him to Imo State. DAILY POST learnt that the maid took the boy from a Sunday school class in church, pretending she was sent by the mother, but she made away with him and started begging for alms to raise money for transportation. She had told unsuspecting members of the public that the boy was her younger brother, left behind by their parents, who she lied died in an accident in December. While begging for alms at Yaba, Lagos, one Victoria Nwafor, who observed that the boy was very ill, took the duo to her house in the Sagamu area of Ogun State on December 22, 2021. The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed to newsmen on Tuesday that “immediately the boy fully recovered, the suspect wanted to single-handedly take him to Imo State,” saying this aroused the woman’s suspicion, hence she reported at Sagamu police division on Monday. “Upon the report, the DPO of Sagamu division, CSP Okiki Agunbiade detailed his detectives to go and bring the girl and the little boy. “On interrogation, the girl confessed that she was a maid to the mother of the little boy and that she left with the boy since the 19th of December, 2021, with the intention of taking the boy to Amraku Umorsu in Isiala/Mberna Local Government Area of Imo State,” Oyeyemi explained. He said the maid had confessed that “she took the baby from the church during Sunday school period, and since the Sunday school teacher knows her with the baby’s mother, she had no problem releasing the boy to her.” She had explained further that she decided to beg for alms in order to raise transport fare to Imo. Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police in Ogun, Lanre Bankole, has directed that the baby’s parents be contacted urgently, while the case should be forwarded to the Lagos State Police Command where the crime was committed.
