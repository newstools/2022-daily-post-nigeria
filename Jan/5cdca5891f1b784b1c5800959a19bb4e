A notorious highway robber has been killed by his colleague after operatives of the Ondo State Security Network Agency also known as Amotekun Corps engaged the three-man robbery gang in a shoot-out. It was gathered that during the shoot-out, in a bid to conceal vital information, one of the robbers shot his colleagues in the thigh and in the hospital. The three-man armed gang had waylaid an Abuja-bound passenger bus at Ifira-Akoko in Akoko South East Local Government Area of Ondo State where they robbed the passengers who were transiting the state from Lagos State. Amotekun Corps Commander in the state, Adetunji Adeleye informed that one of the robbers, Musa Jamiu, was arrested while the passengers were rescued and all their belongings returned. Adetunji said “18 passenger bus was waylaid and led into the bush along Ifira-Akoko on January 11, 2022. We were reliably informed that the vehicle was attacked just outside Ifira-Akoko which was on its way to Abuja. “After a pursuit, we found that the vehicle veered into the bush and men of the Ondo State Security Network Agency followed suit and at the end of the day we caught up with the robbers. ”They opened fire on our men and thereafter, we were able to apprehend two of them. One of the armed robbers was angry with the other one for leaving a trace and fired his colleagues in the thigh. We knew he was trying to conceal some facts and our men quickly rushed the injured one to a nearby hospital where he later gave up the ghost.  ”Confessing to the crime, the arrested robber, Jamiu, 32, said that the operation was his first attempt and that his friend known only as ‘MG’ recruited him. Jamiu who claimed to be a farmer added that it was his friend who provided all the guns and bullets used during the operation. “On Tuesday, January 11, ‘MG’ called me that I should come to Isua-Akoko junction and I met him there with another person he brought along. So the three of us went for the operation.”
