Arsenal striker, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, will join Barcelona on one condition. According to respected Spanish journalist, Gerard Romero, Aubameyang will join Barcelona if Ousmane Dembele leaves the Catalan club this year. Romero disclosed this in a tweet via his Twitter handle on Saturday. He tweeted: “AUBAMEYANG ENTERS IF OUSMANE LEAVES. “Barça has a closed economic agreement with the player, until June on loan. Conditions that can allow your arrival. “Arsenal needs the footballer to leave, a case similar to Coutinho, to revalue him.” DAILY POST reports that Aubameyang was banished from Arsenal’s first-team squad by manager, Mikel Arteta after a disciplinary breach led to him being stripped of the captain’s armband. The Gabonese international has not featured for Arsenal for over a month and he is keen to leave the Gunners before the January transfer window closes on Monday night. The 32-year-old has drawn the interest of Barcelona and Juventus in the past. Meanwhile, Barcelona has already told Dembele to leave Camp Nou this January. Dembele rejected a new contract offer by Barcelona, with his current deal expiring in less than six months.
