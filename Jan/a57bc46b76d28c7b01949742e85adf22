President Muhammadu Buhari has reacted to the death of former Finance Minister, Prof. Chu Okongwu. A statement signed by Femi Adesina, his spokesman, said that the President extends his heartfelt condolences to the Okongwu family on the passing of the foremost economist. Buhari, in the statement, said he joins family, friends and associates of the former Minister in paying tribute to whom he described as a “man of many parts.” He noted that Okongwu never hesitated to give his best to the country as a broadcaster with the Nigerian Broadcasting Service, sub-editor, Daily Times Nigeria, Lecturer, University of Nigeria and a Federal Minister of National Planning and later Finance. Buhari said he believes that the perspectives the former lecturer brought to governance and economics, which centred on improving the lives of Nigerians, will not be forgotten. He prayed for the repose of the soul of the departed and divine comfort for his family during this difficult time.
