Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel, has said that striker Romelu Lukaku is ‘impatient.’ Tuchel said this while confirming that Lukaku has been fined for his recent headline-grabbing interview, where he criticized his manager and hinted he would like to return to Inter Milan because he wasn’t happy at Chelsea. The German also said that the Belgium international, who was recalled back to Chelsea’s squad, must accept his fine. “There will be some disciplinary action and he will accept it,” Tuchel was quoted by Metro UK as saying ahead of Chelsea’s Carabao Cup semi-final first leg tie against Tottenham on Wednesday. “It is not a small thing, it is not the biggest thing and it doesn’t make a comeback impossible – absolutely not. This is what we prove now. But something happened and he will be fined and he needs to accept it.” He added, “I think it’s impatience more than anything else. He is impatient. He wants big chances. But he is impatient and it’s hard for him to accept that sometimes the grass doesn’t grow faster when you pull it. “Like in every transfer you have to accept there is a change of environment, a change of city, a change of culture, club, team-mates, playing style and league. “He’s not the first player to take some time but while he was doing it he was always scoring and we were still in the situations where we adapt to each other.”
