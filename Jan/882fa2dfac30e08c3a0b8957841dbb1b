A popular Nigerian cleric, Pastor Adewale Giwa has asked Nigerians to look beyond the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, and former Lagos State governor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, ahead of 2023. Pastor Giwa who is the Senior Pastor of the Awaiting the Second Coming of Jesus Christ Ministry, Akure, Ondo State, emphasised that Tinubu cannot make a good leader for the country over what he described as an error on his part to package President Muhammadu Buhari for Nigerians in 2015. While calling on Nigerians to be determined ahead of 2023 on who becomes the President, Pastor Giwa maintained that none of those vying for the country’s plum job will make it if there is no restructuring. “Tinubu brought a bad product in 2015, and there is no how he can be a good product Nigerians can rely on. “Someone who doesn’t see anything wrong with President Buhari’s administration cannot be a good leader. “Nobody out of those aspiring can be a good leader unless they reorganise the whole system of Nigeria, beginning with the 1999 constitution. Let them give us true federalism. “The electorate has lost confidence in politicians, so Tinubu cannot be a good President. “Ahead of 2023, Nigerians should be determined, focused and prayerful because it is God that can choose a good leader. From 1999 to date, Nigeria has not produced a good leader we can vouch for. “So, Nigerians should be prayerful, they should cry to God to give the country good leader like the Israelites who cried to God and He gave them Samuel, and Samuel was a successful leader during his time. “We need a leader that can feel the pain of the masses. We need a leader that can be able to listen to the cries of the people not a leader who doesn’t care about the feelings of the people.”
