The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has claimed Jose Peseiro has not signed any contract to take over the national team after the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. Augustine Eguavoen, who is currently the NFF technical director, was put in charge of the team after Gernot Rohr was fired. The former defender has led the Super Eagles to three straight victories at the AFCON, despite having barely two weeks to train the team. However, days after Eguavoen’s appointment, Peseiro was announced as the man to take over after the tournament. The 61-year-old was expected to be in Cameroon as an observer prior to taking over for the World Cup qualifiers in March, but has not travelled. “He is not in Cameroon because we have not signed a contract with him yet. “If he had signed a contract, he would have definitely been in Cameroon as planned. “We are managing the public trust. So we have to look at what the people want and we also know what we want as well. “What we all agree on is that we want the team to do well, to play good football, to make Nigerians happy and to win trophies,” a member of the NFF executive council who does not want to be named, told ESPN.
