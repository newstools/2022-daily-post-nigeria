It was gathered that the lone accident involved a Ford bus with registration number, GGE584Y. The vehicle was said to have suffered a tyre burst while speeding and this led to loss of control before it eventually somersaulted. “The suspected causes of the lone crash were tyre burst, excessive speed and loss of control. “The injured victims were taken to Victory Hospital, Ogere and the bodies of the killed were deposited at FOS Ipara,” Okpe said. Meanwhile, the FRSC cautioned motorists to avoid excessive speed, while advising them to always check their tyres to know the expiration date.
