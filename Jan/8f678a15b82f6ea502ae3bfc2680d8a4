There was a mild drama at the Kano Police Command during the parade of the principal suspect in the killings of a five-year girl, Hanifa. Her father, Abubakar Abdussalam, who was in the crowd of onlookers appealed to the immediate prosecution of the suspects. Abdussalam while in tears screamed, “kill this bastard now, please don’t spare him, please I beg you in the names of Allah”. This is even as more revelations surrounding the death of Hanifa Abubakar emerged Friday that the little girl was killed using rat poison worth N100. The principal suspect, Abdulmalik Tanko who claimed he was the proprietor of the school where the child attended said he killed the girl owing to his financial constraints as he was indebted to the owner of the structure which housed the school. The principal suspect and father of three, made the confession when he was paraded before newsmen at the Bompai police headquarters on Friday. The suspect said he demanded a ransom of N6 million but was paid N100,000, which, he claimed, was used to settle his teachers. Meanwhile, an Aunt of the deceased child, who was in physical distress was seen attacking the suspect and raining curses at him for the murder.
