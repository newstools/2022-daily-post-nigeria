The Yobe State Police Command has debunked reports indicating that churches have been burnt and Christians killed in a violent attack in the state. It said the fake news was being spread by mischief makers across social media. “Yobe in Nigeria is boiling now. Churches are being burnt, many Christians killed. Please pray even if it’s 5mins and forward to other people of faith for intercession. Don’t ignore it. Cry to our God against those Islamic terrorists. He’ll hear and heal our land, Nigeria! From CAN Abuja,” the report had said. The command’s spokesman, ASP Dungus Abdulkarim, in a statement however said the state is calm and both Christians and Muslims are living in peace and harmony. “The police command wishes to also reiterate that the fake publication is the handwork of mischief makers who want to throw Yobe State and Nigeria into confusion and religious conflagration”, he said. While reiterating the commitment of the Yobe State Police Command to providing a safe and secured environment for growth and development to thrive, the Abdulkarim called on the general public to continue to cooperate and partner with the command in this noble task.
