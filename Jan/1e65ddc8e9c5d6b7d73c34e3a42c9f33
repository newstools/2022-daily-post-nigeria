Nantes manager, Antoine Kombouaré has given his verdict on the impact of Nigerian winger, Moses Simon at the ongoing 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cameroon. Kombouaré described Simon’s display for Nigeria at the 2021 AFCON so far as ‘good’, adding that it would be better for Nantes if the Super Eagles go far in the competition. Simon currently plays for Nantes. Before he left the French Ligue 1 side to team up with the Super Eagles ahead of the 2021 AFCON, he was arguably Nantes’ best player of the 2021-2022 season. Simon scored two goals and registered six assists in 18 appearances for Nantes. His excellent performances earned him two Nantes’ player of the month awards. The 26-year-old’s brilliant form has continued in Cameroon, where he has scored one goal and registered one assist in three games for Augustine Eguavoen’s men. Simon has been a terror for defenders at the AFCON with his dribbling and pace on the left flank in the Super Eagles squad. He has more dribbles (15) than any other player in the group stages and was named by CAF in the best XI for the group stage. “I am very interested in the CAN and I watch almost all the matches,” Kombouaré told Nantes’ official website. “Of course, I am very happy for the boys selected. There were great performances from all our players. “Of course, especially Moses Simon, with Nigeria, he’s doing something good. Now it’s time for the cutthroat matches. It’s good to see them advancing in the competition and the further they go, the better it will be for us.” Simon is expected to feature for Nigeria when they take on Tunisia in the AFCON last-16 on Sunday.
