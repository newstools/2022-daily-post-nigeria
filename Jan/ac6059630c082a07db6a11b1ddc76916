Juventus midfielder, Aaron Ramsey, is set to leave the club to join Arsenal’s rivals, Crystal Palace. Ramsey, a former Arsenal player, is already in talks with Crystal Palace over a deal this January transfer window. Crystal Palace manager, Patrick Vieira, is also pushing to convince the 31-year-old to join the Premier League side this month. This was disclosed by football transfer expert, Nicolò Schira, via his Twitter handle at the weekend. Schira tweeted, “#CrystalPalace have asked Aaron #Ramsey to #Juventus: Patrick #Vieira is pushing to convince the former Arsenal’s midfielder to accept #CPFC.
