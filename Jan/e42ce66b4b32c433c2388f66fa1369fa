According to @JoyDaminabo_, “I was there and it was a mess people were rushed to clinics because of the stampede. “They wanted to kidnap Teni then her bouncers started shooting everywhere not just towards the sky but everywhere it was horrible I feel bad for her.” Another eyewitness claimed the shots were fired after a fight broke out between two showgoers while other stories said members of rival cults engaged themselves in a shootout, causing pandemonium.
