Former Chelsea star, Tony Cascarino has warned Newcastle against signing banished Arsenal striker, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Cascarino does not see Aubameyang as the best deal for Newcastle, who are looking to boaster their squad this January as they fight relegation. The Gabon international was stripped of the captaincy and banished from the Gunners first team after being accused of disciplinary breach. Newcastle are said to be in pole position to sign Aubameyang who has since departed North London for the Africa Cup pf Nations. But Cascarino says signing Aubameyang would be an unwise move for Newcastle boss, Eddie Howe’s side. “He’s someone who is not in the Arsenal first-team, let’s get that right,” Cascarino told talkSPORT. “Do you want a player who is going to show commitment, running, doing all the ugly stuff in the game that you’re going to need to survive? Does he do that very well? I’d say that’s the worst part of his game. “I don’t see this deal being a good one for Newcastle at all.” Cascarino believes that Aubameyang may feel he is doing Newcastle a favour by joining the relegation-threatened side, insisting that that is not the case. Newcastle are 19th in the league table with just 11 points after 19 games and are looking for big-name players to turn things around and stave them off relegation waters.
