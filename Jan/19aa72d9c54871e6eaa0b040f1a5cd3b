The Senate Committee Chairman on Army, Senator Ali Ndume, has urged the military to suppress the activities of the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) in Southern Borno. Ndume made the call when he led members of the committee on an oversight visit to the headquarters of Joint Operation Hadin Kai in Maiduguri on Wednesday. According to him, ‘Boko Haram terrorists are surrendering’, while ISWAP is still attacking people. “As Boko Haram members are surrendering, ISWAP is attacking people, particularly in the southern part of the state. “It’s also important that we commend your effort to put you on notice. “Please do more so that under your leadership (Theatre Commander) this year, it will be written in gold that you brought an end to the insurgency. “We are Borno to assess the security situation on the ground as well as find ways of addressing the challenges,” Ndume said. Earlier, Maj.-Gen. Christopher Musa, the Theatre Commander, hailed the committee for its commitment to address the challenges facing the army and assured it of the theatre’s commitment to discharge its assigned task. “We say a big thank you for your dedication, sacrifice and commitment. “We will continue to put our best to ensure total peace is restored to the northeast and Borno in particular,” Musa said.
