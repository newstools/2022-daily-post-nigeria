Some Nigerians have accused President Muhammadu Buhari of trying to deceive Nigerians ahead of the 2023 elections. They made the remark in response to the Federal Government’s declaration of bandits as terrorists. The Buhari government had made the declaration about a month ago after a Federal High Court in Abuja had proscribed bandits. The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), had disclosed the gazetting of the court judgment which proscribed bandits. This follows weeks of foot-dragging after Justice Taiwo Taiwo granted an ex parte application for Yan Bindiga (Hausa word for gunmen) and Yan Ta’adda (Hausa word for terrorists) to be declared as terrorists. However, some Nigerians wondered why the Buhari government opted to take action on the court pronouncement now that 2023 is around the corner. But, others commended the Federal Government for the intervention which reduces the issue of insecurity in the northern part of the country. see tweets gathered by DAILY POST below @symoflix: “It’s a good thing to proscribe bandits but I read meaning to the timing of the declaration. Why did it take them this long before gazetting the court ruling?” @lindybaby: “Buhari is being smart because 2023 is around the corner and he knows that his government is not doing well.” @trixnicfam: “I think it’s a careful plot in trying to deceive Nigerians that APC is working. Why is it now that bandits will be declared terrorists? Why didn’t they take the action since? This government didn’t waste time in declaring IPOB as terrorists but declared with bandits, I smell a rat. 2023 fast approaching.” @abenica: “Buhari’s government should be commended for the feat, this shows that he is determined to tackle insecurity in the country.” @philopily: “Declaring bandits terrorists is commendable but I hope they treat them as bandits. They should get the treatment deserved.”
