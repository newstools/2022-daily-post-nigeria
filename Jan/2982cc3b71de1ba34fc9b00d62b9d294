Augustine Eguavoen has blamed Senegalese centre referee, Maguette N’Diaye, for playing a part in Super Eagles 1-0 defeat to Tunisia on Sunday. The Super Eagles crashed out of the Africa Cup of Nations on Sunday after suffering an unexpected defeat to the Carthage Eagles. Alex Iwobi was shown a red card just seven minutes after the Everton midfielder came off the bench to replace Kelechi Iheanacho. The former Arsenal player was penalised for stamping on the ankle of Youssef Msakni but Eguavoen does not think N’Diaye made the right decision. Eguavoen questioned the referee’s inconsistent decision-making during the game. “It’s a little bit difficult, I don’t like to talk too much about referees because they are the masters but there’s nothing wrong if one makes his observations,” Eguavoen told reporters. “Iwobi’s red card I don’t think was the first foul and it wasn’t intentional also but we have to look at the VAR later and see. “However, first offence I don’t think demands a red card, it wasn’t dangerous play and then right in his face I can see one of the most gentlemen in the team Wilfred Ndidi got smashed right in front of the referee. “Ndidi hardly complains, he complained which means it was a clear foul but having said that we gained an advantage to move on on breakaways and then he recalls it and gives us fouls. “Normally in the game of football when there’s a foul and there’s an advantageous position you let it run so that’s just the only thing I see but again you know the referee is a gentleman and he should be able to control his emotions once the game is on. “Everywhere is tensed up, it has happened there is nothing we can do about it.”
