Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed, on Sunday received scores of All Progressives Congress (APC) members at Awalah area of Bauchi metropolis who defected to the ruling People’s Democratic Party (PDP). Following their defection, the party men were led to Governor Mohammed for his blessings by the Senior Special Adviser on Youths Affairs, Bala Saleh Chiroma, The defectors then handed over their APC office to Governor Mohammed to serve as an office for the PDP. Inaugurating the office, the governor commended the defectors for taking the bold step of dumping the APC for PDP. Mohammed assured them that his administration would carry every member of the party along, promising that they would be treated as full members of the PDP. He, however, advised them to register and get their new party membership cards from their respective wards. Governor Mohammed urged the new PDP members to not only educate other members of APC about the good things the PDP government was doing in the state but also mobilise them to join the ruling party in the state. The spokesperson of the defectors informed that they decided to dump the APC as a result of the various developmental projects spread across the state by the Governor Mohammed-led PDP administration. He said the development being witnessed in the state in the past two years of Mohammed’s administration was unlike what happened when an APC-led administration ruled the state for four years.
