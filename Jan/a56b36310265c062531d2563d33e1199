Commissioner of Police in Cross River State, Aminu Alhassan has said the capacity of the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) to mediate between political parties in the state will be proven during the next House of Representatives by-election in Yala/Ogoja federal constituency. The primaries to pick candidates for contending parties is slated for the 1st of February while the elections for the Akpabuyo state constituency and Yala/Ogoja federal constituency is expected to hold on February 26th, 2022. Alhassan made the remark when IPAC executives led by its Chairman, Ambassador Ogar Osim visited him. “This visit is timely because it has enabled us kick-start work on the by-election which will serve as a test for the general elections,” Alhassan said. He called for regular meetings between IPAC and the Police and promised to invite the group during the next visit of the IGP to the state. Earlier, Osim said IPAC judged it necessary to visit the police command considering their unavoidable role in maintaining peace, orderliness and security of lives and properties. He added that IPAC, being the umbrella body of registered political parties in Nigeria has among other duties, the unrelenting task of ensuring that political parties fulfil their roles of strengthening and deepening internal democracy and encouraging good governance at all levels of Government in the State. “Our statutory duty will be easily achieved with the support of relevant key players in the polity such as your good selves, hence our wish to visit you today. “Our wish is to ensure a violence-free by-election next month as well as the general election next year.” IPAC’s State Organizing Secretary, Chris Eyibio appealed for effective synergy between it and the Police during and after elections to ”circumvent some of the ills perpetrated by politicians”.
