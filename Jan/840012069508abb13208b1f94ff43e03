The Abia State High Court has accused the Nigerian Army of attempting to “terminate” the life of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB. Justice Benson Anya held that the Nigerian Army set out as “pythons” to terminate Kanu’s life. Recall that the Nigerian Army had in 2017 invaded Kanu’s residence in Afaraukwu, Abia State. This was after Justice Binta Nyako of an Abuja Federal High Court granted the IPOB leader bail in the same year. Following the invasion, the IPOB leader had fled to Europe. But the IPOB leader, through his Special Counsel, Aloy Ejimakor, had filed a fundamental human rights suit against the Nigerian government. Among other things sought, Kanu prayed the court to declare the invasion of his residence by the Nigerian government as illegal and an infringement of his fundamental human right. Ruling on the suit, the judge described the action of the Nigerian Army as notorious hence the Nigerian government should tender an apology. The judge’s ruling was made public on Friday by Kanu’s Special Counsel via a tweet. “It is the view of this court that the Army set out as pythons to TERMINATE the life of Nnamdi KANU. The military invasion of his home at Afaraukwu Ibeku is so notorious that this Court cannot turn a blind eye to it. He deserves an apology & compensation,” Justice Benson Anya said.
