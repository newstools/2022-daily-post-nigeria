Denmark midfielder, Christian Eriksen, has said he “died for five minutes” after he collapsed on the pitch in June. However, the 29-year-old insists his goal is to play in this year’s World Cup in Qatar. Eriksen has not played since suffering a cardiac arrest against Finland in last year’s European Championship in Copenhagen. After he collapsed on the field, he received life-saving treatment on the pitch. “At the hospital, they kept saying I’d received more and more flowers,” Eriksen said. “It was weird because I didn’t expect people to send flowers because I’d died for five minutes.” The Dane recently saw his contract terminated by Inter, after having a heart-starter device implanted following his dramatic collapse. Such devices are not permitted in Italy and his career there was effectively ended. “My goal is to play in the World Cup in Qatar, that’s been my mindset all along. Whether I’ll be picked is another thing, but it’s my dream to come back. So until then, I’m just going to play and prove that I’m back at the same level,” he said.
