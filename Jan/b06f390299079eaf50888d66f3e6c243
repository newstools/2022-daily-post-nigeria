Real Madrid striker, Karim Benzema, has insisted that Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo did not stop him from being the best version of himself at Los Blancos. Benzema also said that he was not Ronaldo’s deputy at Real Madrid. Benzema and Ronaldo were teammates at Real Madrid and won several trophies, including the Champions League. However, Ronaldo left Real Madrid to join Juventus before he eventually left the Serie A giants for Man United in the summer of 2021. “It (the role Benzema played alongside Ronaldo) wasn’t a deputy, it wasn’t that,” Benzema told France Football. “I didn’t say to myself: ‘Ah, I have to give him the ball all the time’. I was playing well but he was scoring twice [each game]. It’s the truth, you can’t do anything about it. “Since he left for Juve, I took over in my own way and it’s going well. I don’t play like Cristiano Ronaldo, and he doesn’t play like Karim Benzema. “He didn’t stop me from being the best version of myself. We won a lot of games, I had a lot of fun. To think like that is to be too individual. I won it all with him. The Champions League, many championships, we scored I don’t know how many goals, we were part of the magic trio with [Gareth] Bale, there were a lot of very good moments and I don’t see any bad ones.”
