Interim coach of the Super Eagles, Augustine Eguavoen has revealed that keeping possession and cutting Mohamed Salah’s supplies was key to beating Egypt in their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, opening clash on Tuesday. Nigeria cruised to a 1-0 victory against the Pharaohs at the Roumdé Adjia Stadium, Garoua, thanks to Kelechi Iheanacho’s first-half goal. Eguavoen’s men dominated the game, bossing possession and creating more dangerous chances than Egypt. “We tried to play high pressure at every given time, we know we can mix it up by ball possession and going direct when necessary,” Eguavoen said at his post-match press conference after the game. “So we have three things in mind, first in the mission was to win the game, and how do we win the game? The process is keeping the ball and then keeping Salah, try to cut him off the game.” Nigeria’s next game is against Sudan on Saturday.
