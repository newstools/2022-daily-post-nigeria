The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Ogun Sector Command, has expressed worries as 300 persons lost their lives to road crashes caused by speed violations in 2021. According to the FRSC, speed violation, which was as a result of human error, accounted for over 77% of road crashes in Ogun State in 2021. It was said that over 300 victims were left dead, while about 1200 victims were injured in accidents involving over 200 vehicles. Ogun FRSC spokesman, Florence Okpe, said reports have revealed that Sienna vehicles had high involvement in crashes, saying “speed accounted for over 80% of crashes involving this category of vehicle.” To stem the tide, the Ogun State Sector Command of the FRSC said it has initiated plans to “deploy Radar Guns for speed detection and control.” The traffic regulatory agency said it is ready to sustain the enforcement of the installation of Speed Limiting Devices in commercial vehicles as a whole and by extension Sienna vehicles, which Okpe said have been observed to have high involvement in crashes. “The enforcement which is scheduled to take effect as soon as possible will be collaboratively carried with other sister agencies like the Nigerian Army, Police etc. “This was contained in the statements of the Sector Commander, FRSC Ogun Corps Commander, Ahmed Umar during a strategic meeting with Unit Commanders and other Senior Officers of the formation in Ogun State on Friday 20 January 2022 at the Sector Command Office in Abeokuta. “The operations is scheduled to hold across the state especially the major corridors. Radar guns will be used to check the speed of vehicles and detect any erring motorists. “However, commercial motorists, especially owners of Sienna vehicles are hereby advised to install speed limiting device in their vehicles and be law-abiding and desist from acts that can pose as threats to them and other road users, as life has no duplicate,” Okpe said in a statement made available to DAILY POST on Sunday.
