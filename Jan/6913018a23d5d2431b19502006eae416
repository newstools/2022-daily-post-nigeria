Paris Saint-Germain forward, Kylian Mbappe, has named Morocco’s Achraf Hakimi as the best right-back in the world. Mbappe, a club teammate with Hakimi at PSG, said this after Morocco defeated Malawi 2-1 in the AFCON 2021 round of 16 tie on Tuesday night. Recall that Hakimi scored a sublime winner during Morocco’s AFCON last-16 tie against Malawi to send his team into the quarter-final stage. The former Inter Milan and Real Madrid star curled in an outrageous free-kick from 25 yards out, prompting wild celebrations among his Moroccon teammates as they won the game 2-1 after 90 minutes. His stunning strike saw Mbappe call him the world’s best right-back. In a tweet via his Twitter handle, Mbappe wrote: “ACHRAF HAKIMI. BEST RB IN THE WORLD. GOOD NIGHT GUYS.” Hakimi will now hope to lead Morocco to victory in their next game in the AFCON last-8. Morocco will meet the winner between Ivory Coast and Egypt in the AFCON last-8 on Sunday evening in Yaounde.
