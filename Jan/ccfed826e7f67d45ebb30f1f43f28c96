The Osun State Commissioner of Police, Wale Olokode said the command has not confirmed the identity of the alleged operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) who were arrested in connection with the alleged abduction of a businessman in Osogbo, the state capital. It was reported that a Bureau de Change businessman in the Sabo area of Osogbo, said some armed men invaded his office and whisked him away to a bush along Ilesa road. It was further alleged that the prime suspect of the abduction, Ajibola Ogunibi, connived with the alleged DSS and NSCDC officers to kidnap the businessman. Ajibola reportedly received N15,000 from the proceeds of the operation. Meanwhile, the CP said five persons were arrested in connection with the abduction of the businessman while the investigation is ongoing. He said that the command has written the DSS and NSCDC to ascertain whether the suspects are staff of the sister security outfits. Olokode said, “It is not confirmed yet. The suspect mentioned that the DSS and NSCDC were accomplices, but we have written the organisation to confirm whether they are staff or not.” In his reaction, the Public Relations Officer of the NSCDC, Adigun Daniel, said the agency is not aware of any arrest of its members. Adigun condemned the state police for not confirming the identities of the alleged NSCDC operatives before releasing the information to the media. He said, “The police is yet to ascertain the identity of the said staff. We just found out that they went on air. “If they arrested men from our command, we ought to have been informed. You can’t just go on air without identifying them because those people can be claiming what they are not. They might just go and rent uniforms. “What they need to do is to give us their name and check-in our database to know whether they are civil defenders or not and if reversed is the case we know what to do next,” he said.
