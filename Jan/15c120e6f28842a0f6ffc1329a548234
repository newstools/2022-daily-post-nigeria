Two European clubs, Watford and Sparta Rotterdam, have reacted to Nigeria’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, 1-0 victory over Egypt on Tuesday evening. Watford and Sparta Rotterdam also sent congratulatory messages to Nigeria goalkeeper, Maduka Okoye, following his impressive display during Super Eagles’ win over Egypt in Cameroon. Recall that Nigeria defeated Egypt, thanks to Kelechi Iheanacho’s first-half goal. The Super Eagles are in the 2021 AFCON Group D alongside Egypt, Sudan and Guinea-Bissau. They will face Sudan in their next 2021 AFCON fixture on Saturday. Reacting after the game, Watford wrote on Twitter: “Well done, boys! A clean sheet for Troost-Ekong and @OkoyeMaduka in Nigeria’s victorious #AFCON2021 opener against Egypt!” On their part, Sparta wrote: “Congratulations @OkoyeMaduka and #TeamNigeria with the 1-0 victory in the @CAF_Online. Our home is in your colours! #NGAEGY.” Meanwhile, Okoye, who signed for Watford last November, is currently on loan at Sparta Rotterdam until the end of the season.
