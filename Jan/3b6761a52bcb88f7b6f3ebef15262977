Napoli striker, Victor Osimhen has finally returned to the club after months of absence owing to facial injury and Covid-19. The club announced on Sunday morning that the striker was returning to Napoli in a few hours. The Serie A club announced that the Nigeria international has tested negative for Covid-19. This is exactly ten days after he tested positive. “Victor is negative to Covid-19 and will return to Italy in the coming hours,” Napoli wrote on their official Instagram account. Osimhen is not part of the Nigerian squad for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations billed to commence today in Cameroon due to his club’s refusal to let him go. The energetic striker, who will be seriously missed in the Super Eagles’ camp, is expected to undergo tests upon his return to Napoli.
