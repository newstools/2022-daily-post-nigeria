The Northern Youth Unity Forum says over 50,000 northerners are currently languishing in different prisons in Lagos State. Chairman of the forum, Dr. Ibrahim Yau Galadanchi disclosed this while addressing newsmen in Kano. Representing the Chairman, Ibrahim Usman said a number of northerners were arrested and locked inside prison for a long period of time. According to him, the offence is nothing other than going to the state in search of a leaving. “Whenever our men trooped from different northern states and arrive Lagos, security agencies and the area boys interrogated them about the purpose of their visit to the state, and from there they locked them in prisons,” he said. The forum, therefore, called on Northern Governors to, as a matter of urgency, visit the state and engage the Lagos State Government on the fate of thousands of northerners being persecuted in the state. He, therefore, advised the north to provide alternatives to their youth in order to prevent them from unnecessary arrest in Lagos and other southern states.
