The Senate Committee chairman on Youth mobilization, Sen. Obinna Ogba, representing Ebonyi Central senatorial zone in the National Assembly, on Saturday, declared intention to run for Governor of Ebonyi State in the forthcoming 2023 general election. Ogba, who is a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and a two-term ranking Senator in the National Assembly, said he decided to run for the governorship to take away the massive poverty ravaging the people of the State. The governorship aspirant made this known while briefing journalists in Abakaliki, capital of Ebonyi State. According to him: “This is my official declaration to contest the 2023 governorship election in Ebonyi State on the platform of our party, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. “The former governors of the State have contributed their quota in various aspects of growth and development of Ebonyi State. But despite all their efforts, youths and human capital development is still suffering in Ebonyi. “Poverty is still massively prevalent in our homes, which among other things is the reason I am declaring my intention to run for the position of Governor in Ebonyi State.” DAILY POST reports that Ebonyi State has three senatorial zones: Ebonyi North, Ebonyi Central and Ebonyi South senatorial zones. Ebonyi North first produced the governor of the State, followed by Ebonyi Central and currently the Ebonyi South is ruling the State. It was learnt that the former governor of Ebonyi State, Sam Egwu is advocating that power should be zoned to Ebonyi North where it first started. But, Senator Ogba argued that there was nothing like zoning of governorship in the State and challenged leaders of the State to bring evidence wherein it was signed.
