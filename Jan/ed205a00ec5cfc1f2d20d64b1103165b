Manchester United manager, Ralf Rangnick has said that it is more important to have Edinson Cavani in his side’s squad when they tackle Wolves in a Premier League tie on Monday night. Rangnick said this while speaking on resting forward, Cristiano Ronaldo for Man United’s clash with Wolves at Old Trafford. The Devils boss, who said he doesn’t see any reason why Ronaldo shouldn’t be able to play against Wolves, explained that it would not be a problem at one stage if Man United needed to rest the Portugal captain. Asked if he has concerns about Cristiano Ronaldo playing for the third time in seven days [against Wolves], Rangnick was quoted by Man United’s official website as saying at his pre-match press conference: “Today I didn’t see any reason he shouldn’t be able to play another game. “Physically, he seems to be fit. He is doing everything. He’s a top professional, he looks after himself and after his body, he eats the right things. “At the age of 36, I have never seen a player at this age, maybe [Zlatan] Ibrahimovic is a little bit older but is a different kind of player, but I don’t see why he should not be able to play three games in eight days, but if at one stage we need to rest him it is no problem, but then it is even more important to have Edinson in the squad.”
