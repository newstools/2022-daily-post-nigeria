The Seriki Fulani of Ibarapaland, Alhaji Saliu Abdulkadir, has opposed the release of Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Igboho. Abdulkadir, who was evicted from his Igangan residence, said he opposes Igboho’s release due to his daring nature. The Seriki Fulani had relocated to Ilorin, Kwara State after Igboho issued an eviction notice to Fulanis in Igangan. Abdulkadir lamented that Igboho carried out his eviction notice without relevant authorities challenging him. He noted that there are criminals among Yorubas just like Fulanis; hence the government should fish out such elements. “For those seven days, the state government sent 14 police officers to us and they were guiding us but the police officers were overpowered by Sunday Igboho’s men. This is why I don’t support the call for the release of Igboho. “I am sure he must be regretting his actions now. Any Nigerian can live in any part of the country and I have always said that there are criminals everywhere. There are criminals among Yoruba just like we have among the Fulani people. This is where we expected the government to come in and fish out those who are criminally minded,” he told Daily Trust. Igboho has been detained in Benin Republic after he was arrested at Cardinal Bernardin International Airport, Cotonou. The freedom fighter was arrested while on his way to Germany in July 2021. He had fled Nigeria to Cotonou after the Department of State Services, DSS, declared him wanted. The Nigerian secret police had declared him wanted after weapons were discovered in his Ibadan residence during a raid.
