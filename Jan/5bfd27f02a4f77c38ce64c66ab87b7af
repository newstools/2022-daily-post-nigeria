A member of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Osun State, Dotun Babayemi has assured that the party will form the next government in the State. This is as he admonished all eligible voters in the State to treasure their Permanent Voters’ Cards (PVC) and use it to affect the desired positive change in the State leadership in the July election. Dotun Babayemi, who is a gubernatorial aspirant under the party, gave this assurance at the Osun PDP gubernatorial aspirants screening, which was held Wednesday at the PDP National Secretariat, Abuja. Babayemi, who maintained that the time for positive change in the government of the State had come, disclosed that all the six gubernatorial aspirants who have declared interest in the race and have been screened by the party were capable of performing better than any candidate that will be fielded by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the State. The gubernatorial aspirant also revealed that when the party comes to power in late 2022, it will focus on moving the State forward, especially in the area of industrialisation, youth engagement, education, agriculture, and health services. While promising to abide by the party’s final decision on its flag bearer in the Osun 2022 gubernatorial election, Babayemi maintained that he was confident the PDP screening committee will be diligent in its assignment before reporting to the National Working Committee. In his words, “I am confident that the party’s screening committee will be diligent in the assignment given to it before reporting back to the National Working Committee of the party. “I trust in the party’s leadership at the national, zonal and State levels and the elders’ caucus in Osun State who are genuinely concerned about the welfare of the masses to make the right choice. “I promise to abide by the party’s final decision on who would be its flagbearer.”
