Cameroon on Sunday won their first opening match against Burkina Faso in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, fixture. The host nation came from a goal down to defeat Burkina Faso. The Indomitable Lions won 2-1 against Burkina Faso in their first game of Group A. Gustavo Sangare had scored for Burkina Faso in the 24 minutes in the first half. However, Cameroon leveled through Vicent Aboubakar’s 40 minutes penalty. Aboubakar then gave Cameroon a 2-1 lead just before half-time after converting another penalty. The encounter eventually ended 2-1 in favour of the host nation after full time as both teams failed to score in the second half. The win means Cameroon is now on top of the Group A table with 3 points from one game. Meanwhile, Ethiopia will take on Cape Verde in the other Group A fixture later tonight.
