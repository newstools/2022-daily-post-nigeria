President Muhammadu Buhari, on Wednesday, ruled out the possibility of a political solution in the case of Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Buhari disclosed this during an interview aired on Channels Television. Recently, some Igbo leaders urged Buhari to grant Kanu freedom. The elders, led by former Minister of Aviation in the First Republic, Chief Mbazulike Amaechi, had made the call during a meeting with Buhari at the State House, Abuja. The Amaechi-led elders had urged the president to grant the IPOB leader an unconditional release. Kanu was rearrested in June 2021 in Kenya and repatriated to Nigeria to continue his trial before an Abuja Federal High Court. Following his repatriation, the separatist has been locked up at the Department of State Services, DSS. The IPOB leader is facing trial before Justice Binta Nyako-led court for charges based on terrorism. Speaking on the trial of Kanu during the interview, the president said: “I wouldn’t dare interfere with the judiciary.”
