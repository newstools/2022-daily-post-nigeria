The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Osun State has asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to ensure a free and transparent governorship election in the state. DAILY POST recalls that INEC had fixed July 16, 2022, for the governorship election in the state. The Director, Media and Publicity of a faction of PDP in the state supported by Senator Ademola Adeleke, Oladele Oluwabamiji, explained that the way and manner the state governorship election is conducted would determine the 2023 general elections. According to Oluwabamiji, there should not be a repeat of controversies that dogged the 2018 governorship election in the state, saying that the rest of the world would be watching how the electoral commission will manage the governorship election in the state. He said that there is nothing the people expect than to be fair as the umpire, stressing that the kind of scenario that they witnessed in 2018 should not repeat itself. He stressed, “I hope INEC will not try the will of Osun people this time around. They should be able to gauge the temperature; they should be able to feel how the pulse of the people of Osun State is wired, vis-a-vis what happened in the last election and INEC being fair would be the least that people will expect from them.” He employed INEC to be fair, not just in the interest of Osun State, but also in their own interest too, assuring that the Osun election being the gateway to other national elections will tell Nigerians a lot about what to expect in the subsequent elections.
