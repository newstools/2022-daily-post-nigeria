A group of Igbo youths under the aegis of Ohanaeze Youth Council has charged the Judiciary to deliver judgement on Mazi Nnamdi Kanu’s case without fear or favour. OYC said it has been monitoring the court proceedings since 27th August 2021 when the case was filed before Justice Benson Anya of the High Court of Abia State in Umuahia. The apex youth wing of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, gave this charge on Friday, through the National President, Igboayaka O. Igboayaka, in a release made available to DAILY POST in Owerri, Imo State capital. The group expressed confidence in the Judiciary and urged the Judge to deliver judgement in accordance with the law without prejudice. The release reads, “One of the greatest values of Judiciary is her independence, and this value has shaped the pathway of Judiciary in Nigeria, by giving hope to a common man. “OYC being the mouthpiece of over 30 million Igbo Youths, count on Judiciary to serve justice on the Case of Fundamental human rights of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu on 19th January 2022”. OYC urged members of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, led by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu to remain calm and act within the framework of the law, pointing out that the judiciary will continue to checkmate executive rascality by delivering sound judgement devoid of executive influence.
