A police Sergeant, Haruna Yusuf has been arrested in Osogbo, Osun State by operatives of the Inspector-General of Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT), for selling a rifle belonging to his colleague to a cultist in Kwara. Yusuf, a traffic warden attached to the Omu-Aran Police Division in Irepodun local government area of Kwara, confessed to newsmen in Osogbo, when he and six members of the Aiye confraternity were paraded by the State Command on Friday. He was arrested alongside suspected cultists responsible for violent criminal attacks in Omu Aran and neighbouring communities in Kwara State. Yusuf revealed that he stole the rifle from his former Station Officer of Omu-Aran who was later dismissed over the missing gun. The IRT operatives in Osun State were reportedly working to prevent an attack on the state by suspected cult members when one of the cult members was arrested. In Yusuf’s confession, “I stole the gun from my former Station Officer. I didn’t know what happened to me. I sold it for N47,000.” His arrest also led to the arrest of other members of his group and the eventual arrest of another serving policeman, who sold arms to them for operation.
