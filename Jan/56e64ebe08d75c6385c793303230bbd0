A source from the community who pleaded anonymity said the kidnappers left behind the vehicle and the luggage but took away the passengers. According to the source, “no one knows where they were taken to. The bus was still steaming when the villagers saw it on Tuesday at that lonely area called Odo Rubber. Phones and luggage of the passengers were intact.” Meanwhile, the police command has taken over the investigation of the matter and the abandoned luggage.
