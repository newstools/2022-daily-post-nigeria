Bishop David Oyedepo of Living Faith Church, has recounted why some Nigerians once called him a devil and wished him dead. Oyedepo disclosed that he was called a devil for preaching prosperity. He disclosed this while preaching to his members at the church’s headquarters in Ota, Ogun State on the theme “Blood of Sprinkling Service” on Sunday. Oyedepo said Nigerians were angry that he was preaching prosperity instead of suffering. He, however, said some of his attackers are now preachers of prosperity. The preacher noted that a God-ordained leader sees things ahead of others. According to Oyedepo: “I was a devil teaching prosperity, people were grieved, they wished I died. Now, everybody including the major attackers are now writing on prosperity. True leaders see ahead of others, every God-ordained leader is a pacesetter.” The clergy man recalled how suffering was once seen as a blessing in Nigeria. Bishop Oyedepo is known as one of the richest pastors in Africa and around the world today. His church has universities and he is also blessed with multiple private jets.
