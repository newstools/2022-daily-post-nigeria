The All Progressives Congress (APC) National Reconciliation Committee, on Saturday, arrived in Osogbo, the Osun State capital. The mission of the committee, it was revealed to DAILY POST, is to find a final resolution to the feud between Rauf Aregbesola, the Interior Minister and former governor of the state, and the incumbent, Adegboyega Oyetola. DAILY POST also gathered that part of the mandate of the Senator Abdullahi Adamu-led committee is to resolve the issues lingering within the state chapter of the APC.  The committee is expected to meet both warring factions with a view to resolving the seeming unending feud which has divided the ruling party into two factions, The Osun Progressives (TOP) loyal to Aregbesola, and the Ilerioluwa camp loyal to the governor. As at the time of filing this report, members of the committee were in a meeting with Oyetola.
