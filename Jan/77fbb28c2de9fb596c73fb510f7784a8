A teenager, Mustapha Abdullahi, was arraigned at the Ejigbo Magistrates’ Court on Friday. The defendant allegedly stole a cable worth N75,000 from a transformer, NAN reports. The 19-year old, residing in the Igando area of Lagos, faces one count charge of stealing. The prosecutor, Insp. Benedict Aigbokhan, said the felony happened on December 24, 2021, at Oje Olorunfemi Street, Egan, Igando. The police officer told the court that Abdullahi’s action threw the community into darkness. The theft of the cable, an Ikeja Electric Distribution Company (IKEDC) property, contravened Section 287 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The section provides three years imprisonment for the offence. Abdullahi pleaded not guilty to the charge. The Magistrate, Mr E. O. Ogunkanmi, granted him N100,000 bail. The defendant must provide two sureties employed; they must show evidence of tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case was adjourned until February 21 for further hearing.
