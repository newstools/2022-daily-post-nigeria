Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has donated the sum of N30million to families of three police officers who died last year in the line of duty. The victims include; Isaac Isodje, Savior Udeh and Ebenezer Edward who were all Police Inspectors. They served under Diobu division of the state police command and were killed in November while on a stop and search duty. The State Commissioner for Information and Communications, Paulinus Nsirim presented the cheques to the families of the deceased officers on behalf of Governor Wike on Thursday. The commissioner said the gesture is a demonstration of the governor’s commitment to ensuring that families of police officers who died on duty do not suffer. “This is a token of love from Governor Nyesom Wike to the families. Though money cannot replace a life, but, it is a way of showing love to all officers and men who serve in Rivers State that the State Government will always be behind them no matter the situation they find themselves. “So, the amount here is a token of love from the Governor as a man who has the milk of human kindness and compassion to cushion the impact of this great loss.” Speaking at the event the Rivers state Commissioner of Police Ebuka Friday described Governor Wike’s action as an uncommon gesture.
