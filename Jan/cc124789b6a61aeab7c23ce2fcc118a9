The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has accused the Department of State Services, DSS, of arresting and torturing three Igbo women. IPOB’s spokesman, Emma Powerful, alleged that the DSS arrested and tortured the women for refusing to lie against its leader, Nnamdi Kanu. Powerful claimed that the women were held in solitary confinement. In a statement, the group reiterated its call for the unconditional release of Kanu. According to Powerful: “Our leader Mazi Nnamdi KANU must be released unconditionally. So, the Federal Government won’t achieve their aim because our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and IPOB members committed no crime known to law both locally and internationally. “Again, we want to raise the alarm that the Department of State Services, DSS, has concluded plans to hold and keep torturing three innocent Igbo women in solitary confinement without allowing them out of their tiny cell at all. “These innocent women were being held under such condition because they have refused to lie against our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, so the DSS intend to break their spirits.” Powerful alleged that the DSS obtained “black market orders” to detain the innocent women and other Biafra sympathizers indefinitely. He urged the world to hold the DSS accountable for such actions. “The DSS is going to courts and obtaining black market orders to detain Biafrans indefinitely. And one of the judges issuing such orders is Justice Maha of Federal High Court Abuja. The world should be aware of this. They must be made to account for their crimes,” he said.
