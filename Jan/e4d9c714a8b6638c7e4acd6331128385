Tunde Rahman, a media aide to the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu, has cleared the air on why his boss jetted out to the United Kingdom, UK. DAILY POST recalls that the social media was stirred up yesterday with reactions from Nigerians over the London trip as many alleged that Tinubu went to the UK for his usual medical attention. Recall that the former Lagos State Governor returned to Nigeria from the UK in October, after undergoing knee surgery. However, in a statement issued on Friday by his media aide, Tinubu, a 2023 presidential candidate was said to have travelled abroad to attend some meetings regarding his political ambition. According to the aide, the Asiwaju of Lagos would be back in the country next week after his consultation meeting with stakeholders in the UK. He said, “Asiwaju Tinubu is in fine health and excellent spirits. The speculations in a national newspaper and on social media are just what they are: unfounded and untrue speculations.” “Asiwaju’s trip to the UK is not to rest or because of any illness. While abroad, Asiwaju is maintaining a vigorous schedule of meetings and consultations on a range of important matters. “Whether at home or abroad, the daily schedule of Asiwaju is vibrant and full. Most people couldn’t sustain his high level of activity. Asiwaju will return to Nigeria next week once this set of meetings and talks abroad is completed.”
