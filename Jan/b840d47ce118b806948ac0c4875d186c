Raymond Dokpesi, founder of Daar Communications, has disclosed the shortest way the southeast can produce the president of Nigeria. Dokpesi disclosed that Atiku Abubakar, a Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, a presidential aspirant is the shortest way Igbos can produce a Nigerian president. The media mogul disclosed this while addressing journalists on Monday in Abia State. Dokpesi disclosed that Atiku would be 80 years soon. He said Atiku is running for the presidency to rescue Nigeria from its challenges. According to Dokpesi: “Atiku is the surest bet; he is the shortest cut to a southeast presidency. The truth is that he will be about 80 years then. We only need him to rescue Nigeria now. ”We are confronted with heavy challenges as a nation. Once we lay the foundation for restructuring and for pushing Nigeria forward, then he will exit. He is not coming because he is hungry but he has an agenda, and the agenda is Nigeria.”
