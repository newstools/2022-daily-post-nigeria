The Nigerian military neutralized bandit leaders, Kachalla Ruga and Alhaji Auta in a New Year eve operation. They were targeted Friday night by a Nigerian Air Force (NAF) aircraft after intelligence identified them. Kachalla, Auta and their footsoldiers died at Gusami Forest and Tsamre village in Birnin Magaji Local Government Area. Several bandits who converged at Auta’s residence for his burial were also struck by subsequent bombardment of the location. An officer told PRNigeria that follow-up airstrikes hit fleeing gang members and those hiding under trees. “The whereabouts of other notorious bandits like Alhaji Nashama, Shingi and Halilu, either incapacitated or on the run, remain unknown.” He added that the operation confirmed the resolve of the Armed Forces and other security agencies to crush the threats posed by banditry and terrorism.
