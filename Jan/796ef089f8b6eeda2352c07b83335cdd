Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has criticised his striker, Romelu Lukaku after Chelsea’s 1-0 defeat to Manchester City on Saturday. City opened a 13-point lead at the top of the Premier League with Kevin De Bruyne firing the home side to victory in the second half. It was just one shot on target for Chelsea during the game, while Lukaku cut an isolated figure for the majority of the match. The German gaffer pointed out that Lukaku had ‘many ball losses in very promising circumstances’. “I think we had eight or nine offensive transitions and we had zero touches in the box, that was a big problem today, offensive-wise, the front players, that was simply a lack of precision, a lack of timing, a lack of composure, you cannot think that you’ll get a lot of half chances, deliveries on a level like this,” Tuchel told BT Sport. “We lost too many balls, too many balls too easily, that’s why we have a number like this, it was a big problem in our game today.” Asked if Lukaku was getting the service he needs, Tuchel replied: “Sometimes he needs to do the service. I think he’s included. “He had many ball losses without any pressure, many ball losses in very promising circumstances. He had a huge chance – so he’s included in this. “Of course, we want to serve him but he’s part of the team and the performance upfront, especially in the first half, we can do much, much better. “We need to do much better because we had a lot of transition chances in the first half already.”
