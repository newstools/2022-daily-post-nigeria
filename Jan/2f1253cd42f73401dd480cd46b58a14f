Former Manchester United attacker, Dimitar Berbatov has backed the club to finish in the top four position on the Premier League table as their manager Ralf Rangnick provides ‘stability and momentum’ in his team. Berbotov also singled out Manchester City as the team to beat this season in the Premier League. Man United are in the sixth position on the log with 19 points behind leaders Man City. The Old Trafford club, however, have two games in hand. “I don’t want it to be just a three-horse race, although it’s now looking more like a two-horse race,” Berbatov told Betfair. “I want to see five or six teams push each other to make it more interesting for everyone following the Premier League. “Man United have a great chance to build momentum and get on a good run. They could be back in the mix [top-four] under Ralf Rangnick. It’s a marathon, not a sprint.” He added: “Everyone can beat anyone in the Premier League. It is still an open race and there are a lot of teams that can still get in the mix if they go on the good run. “Without a doubt though, Man City are the team to beat and at the minute it looks as though Liverpool are in the driving seat if Guardiola’s team is to be overtaken.”
