Following the alleged killing of a boy by a policeman in Kabba town of Kogi State, an angry mob on Saturday set the old Police barracks ablaze. DAILY POST had earlier reported that the alleged killing of the young boy by a yet to be identified Police officer sparked protests in Kabba town on Saturday morning. As at time of filing this report, a team of Mobile Policemen and men of the Nigerian Army have been deployed to Kabba town. The situation has, however, been brought under control as calm has returned to the ancient town. Some resident of Kabba who spoke to DAILY POST said the boy was alleged to have taken a sachet of pure water from the Policeman’s man’s car to drink but later had an argument with the Policeman before he was killed. The Kogi State Commissioner of Police CP Edward Egbuka confirmed the latest development to journalists on Saturday afternoon. He said the command is currently investigating the matter.
