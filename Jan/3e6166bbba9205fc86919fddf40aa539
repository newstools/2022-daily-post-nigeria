The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Thursday arraigned Oluremi Ebun Philips before Justice S. O. Solebo of the Special Offences Court in Ikeja, Lagos. The defendant and her company, Omritas Energy Limited, face a five-count charge bordering on stealing and issuance of dud cheques. In one of the counts, Philips and Omritas Energy in 2016 “fraudulently converted and stole N57,690,000, property of AYM Shafa Limited”. The amount was meant for the supply of Automotive Gas Oil (AGO) which they failed to deliver. The cheque issued, when presented for payment, was dishonoured by the bank due to insufficient funds. Phillips pleaded “not guilty” to the charges. Prosecuting counsel, T. J. Banjo prayed the court for a trial date and for her remand. Defence counsel, Akin Olatunji told the judge that a bail application had been filed and served on the prosecution. Justice Solebo adjourned till February 14 and 15, 2022 for trial and ruling on the bail application. The defendant will remain at a Correctional Centre until the next hearing.
