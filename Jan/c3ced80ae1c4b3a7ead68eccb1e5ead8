Senegal coach, Aliou Cissé, has predicted a ‘big battle’ when his side faces Burkina Faso in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, semi-final tie on Wednesday. Cisse also warned Senegal players, including Sadio Mane and Nampalys Mendy, who won the man of the match award against Equatorial Guinea, not to get carried away after beating the Nzalang Nacional 3-1 on Sunday. Recall that Senegal defeated Equatorial Guinea in the AFCON quarter-final tie on Sunday night, thanks to goals from Famara Diedhiou, Cheikhou Kouyate and Ismaila Sarr. Speaking at his post-match press conference after the match, Cisse said: “We played a hard-fought game against a good Equatorial Guinean team. We had the mentality to score three goals. “We must congratulate the opposing team who were technically capable of creating problems for us. We must remember a good victory tonight, synonymous with qualifying for the semi-finals. “We have had a very difficult start to our preparations, but we worked well afterward and today we are gaining momentum. We must not get carried away because against Burkina Faso, it will be a big battle,” he said,
