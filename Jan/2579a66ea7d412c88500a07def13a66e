The 19 Northern Governors say the declaration of bandits as terrorists is a good development. They also hailed the Federal Government for approving the deployment of Super Tucanos against the outlaws. The Chairman and Plateau Governor, Simon Lalong spoke with State House correspondents after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday. Lalong noted that progress is being made and seen on issues raised with the President in 2021. The governor said they were eager to see fighter aircraft go after criminals making life miserable for Nigerians. “The military is now going to do full engagement and we are also getting prepared in the North for such actions. “Let it be massive to ensure that within the first quarter of this year, people will have hope of their security and peaceful living in all parts of the North.” Lalong added that a conducive environment was needed for farmers to boost food production across states. “We want our people to go back to the farm and in most cases, it is this insecurity that is keeping them away from the farms”, he said. The chairman promised that governors would continue to work with traditional rulers and vigilantes to secure communities.
