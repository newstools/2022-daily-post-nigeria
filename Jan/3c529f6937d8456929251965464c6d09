Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State, on Monday, said his defection from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to the All Progressives Congress, APC, does not pose a threat to his presidential ambition. Umahi disclosed that his presidential ambition was in the hands of God. Speaking on Channels TV, the governor said the more governors APC have, the more chances of the party emerging victorious in the 2023 elections. According to Umahi: “I will feel happy rather than being threatened. My ambition is in the hand of God. “The more we have governors in the APC, the more chance we have to win the election. The more chances we have to continue the project of Nigeria from where Mr President will leave it by 2023.” Umahi had hinted at running for the presidency in 2023. The Chairman of the southeast governors had informed Buhari of his presidential ambition. Umahi, while speaking on the development, disclosed that Buhari directed him to seek the support of the people and consult widely with party members and chieftains across the country.
