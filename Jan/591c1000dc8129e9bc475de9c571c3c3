Ahead of the forthcoming 2023 general elections, a former presidential aide, Reno Omokri has advised Nigerians on how they could elect good leaders for a new political era. Omokri, in a post on his official Facebook page on Monday, urged eligible voters to shun the collection of bribes but approach the election with full confidence. He advised Nigerian youths to team up for their preferred candidates as they do to their favourite housemates during the annual reality TV show Big Brother Naija. The socio-political activist expressed optimism that high voter turnout would make rigging relatively impossible for desperate politicians. The post reads, “The 2023 elections are almost here. Approach it like you did with #BBNaija. Form teams for your preferred candidate. Spend your money campaigning for them. Broadcast their manifestos to all your contacts. “Forget about rice and pay try price for your future. Don’t be BBNaija wise and Aso Rock foolish! You say your PVC does not count. Who told you? Rigging is only successful when there is low voter turnout out. “But where there is a high voter turnout, rigging is all but impossible. You waited patiently until the BBNaija phone lines were open for voting. Now, prepare to wait patiently in line, until the PVC machine reads you vote”!
