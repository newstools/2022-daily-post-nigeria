A High court Seven sitting in Gusau, Zamfara State capital, has adjourned the case filed by Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa, challenging the congress conducted by Governor Bello Matawale’s faction of All Progressives Congress, APC, in the state to February 17. The Presiding Judge, Justice Bello kucheri, made it clear that the case was adjourned to February 17 following some processes filed by the counsels to the defendants. Addressing newsmen after the adjournment of the case, one of the counsels to Senator Marafa, Barrister Misbahu Salawuddeen, explained that they were in the court to pray for the annulment of the congresses conducted by Governor Bello Mattawale-led faction of the APC. “We are challenging the congresses conducted by the Matawalle’s faction of the All Progressives Congress here in Zamfara State because they were unconstitutional. “The abnormalities were that our clients were disenfranchised as they were not allowed to purchase the forms and participate in the congress. ”For example, when we applied for the purchase and issuance of the election forms, we were disenfranchised. “The Marafa-led faction of the party were disenfranchised and prevented from participating in the congress after they paid and obtained the forms. “We are saying that we were disenfranchised, that is why we are saying that due process of the law and the APC constitution were not complied with.”
“What they have done was a flagrant disobedience to the party construction”. Reacting to the forthcoming national convention of the party on February 26, Barrister Salawuddeen stated that the case is before the court now and that nobody has the right to determine which of the three factions in the state will be there. He, however, expressed optimism that his clients would get justice at the end of the case.
