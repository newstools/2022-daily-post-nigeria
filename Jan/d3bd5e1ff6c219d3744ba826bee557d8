The Kano State Government has ordered the immediate closure of a private school, Noble Kids Academy, at Kwanar Dakata, in the Nassarawa Local Government Area, where the body of an abducted five-year-old girl, Hanifa Abubakar, was buried by the suspects. The state Commissioner for Education, Muhammad Kiru, announced the closure of the school in a statement. DAILY POST reported earlier that the remains of the victim, who was abducted in December, were discovered in a shallow grave at the primary school. The Commissioner, expressing sadness over the incident, announced that “the state government would commence an investigation of unregistered private schools and teachers to check such criminal activities. “The school has also been closed till further notice.” He admonished parents whose children attend the private school to stop them from doing so pending the completion of the investigation. Meanwhile, the Kano State Police Command confirmed the arrest of two prime suspects, Abdumalik and Hashim Isyaku, who demanded N6 million ransom for her release before she was killed.
