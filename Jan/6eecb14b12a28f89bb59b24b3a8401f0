Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta has reportedly shortlisted four strikers to replace deposed Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, at Emirates. Aubameyang has not been selected by Arteta after he was punished for a ‘disciplinary breach’. The 32-year-old has since been exiled from Arsenal’s first-team and is reportedly willing to leave the North London club in the January transfer window. However, according to ESPN, Arteta’s list of potential targets to replace Aubameyang include Fiorentina’s Dusan Vlahovic, Real Sociedad’s Alexander Isak, Everton’s Dominic Calvert-Lewis and Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins. Arteta had on Friday confirmed that Aubameyang had left Arsenal to report early for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations’ camping with Gabon. The striker has scored four goals in 14 Premier League appearances for Arsenal this season.
