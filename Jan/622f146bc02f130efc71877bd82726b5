A Kano State Chief Magistrate’s Court sitting at Gidan Murtala, has ordered the remand of Jamila Sani, wife of the alleged kidnapper and killer of a pupil, 5-year-old Hanifa Abubakar. Mrs Sani, 30, was arraigned on a count charge of alleged concealing of a kidnap victim. Her husband, Abdulmalik Tanko, who allegedly killed the minor and buried her in a shallow grave, is standing trial on a four-count charge of kidnapping, conspiracy, and culpable homicide. The prosecution alleged that the suspect’s wife concealed a kidnapped victim in her house for a period of five days. “That you Jamila Muhammad Sani, a wife to Abdulmalik Tanko Muhammad, a proprietor and teacher of Noble Kids Comprehensive Academy located at Kwanar Dakota in Kano State, on the 4th December 2021 around 6pm, your husband brought to you Hanifa Abubakar wearing her school uniform and spent five days in your custody. “You kept her hostage, knowing fully that your husband kidnapped her and you refused to disclose it to any person,” the charge read. The prosecution noted that the alleged offense contravenes section 227 of the Penal Code. Consequently, the prosecuting counsel, Lamido Dinki, asked the court to remand the defendant in police custody pending the case diary. In his ruling, Chief Magistrate Muhammad Jibril granted the prayer and ordered that Sani be remanded in police custody till February 2. Hanifa’s Death: Aisha Buhari backs call for killer’s execution
