Super Eagles defensive midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi has stated the difference between Gernot Rohr and Austine Eguavoen’s teams. Ndidi did the comparison while insisting that the team is battle-ready for Sunday’s round of sixteen clash against the Carthage Eagles of Tunisia. After overcoming Egypt, Sudan and Guinea Bissau in the Group D of the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon, Eguavoen’s side will look to continue their impressive run. Ndidi said that the Nigerian team in Cameroon is the same as the one that finished third in the last AFCON, but added that the difference is the philosophy of the two managers. “We are here to compete and win games. There is no difference between this game and the other games we have played here,” Ndidi told a press conference on Saturday. “It’s going to be the same approach and mentality. We will keep going. “It’s the same team, but different philosophy. Our current manager makes things simple for us. “The coach gives us the push and freedom to express ourselves. That’s the difference between 2019 and now.”
