Pastor Enoch Adejare Adeboye of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, has called on members of the church to pray for him and his family members. The 79-year-old clergy however failed to reveal his prayer points. Speaking during a sermon in his church on Sunday, Adeboye said he lives all his life praying for the welfare of his spiritual children scattered across the world. He said, “I want to make a special request before I go into the sermon, that this year like never before please pray for your Pastors. They are human beings, they pray for you all year round, pray for them too. “Pray for your pastors also means pray for your General Overseer. Someone asked me, Daddy, we heard you don’t sleep much at night, you are always going for prayer walks, what are you asking God for? Clothes? I said no I have enough to last me a lifetime. House? I said No, God has given me one and I have no intention of moving out of that place. Cars? Definitely not. “What do you want? I want it to be well with my children all over the world. When there is a storm anywhere in the world, I pray by the grace of God that it doesn’t touch my children. “If there is an earthquake, I pray my children are not affected. I pray for my children, I don’t think it is too much to ask for my children to pray for me. Pray for me and pray for my family”.
