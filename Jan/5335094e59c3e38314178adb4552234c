Egypt on Sunday qualified for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) semi-final after beating Morocco 2-1 in Cameroon. The AFCON quarter-final match ended in a 1-0 win at half-time in favour of Morocco, thanks to Sofiane Boufal’s penalty. However, a second-half goal from Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah ensured Egypt played a 1-1 draw with Morocco after 90 minutes. But Trezeguet scored for Egypt in the first half of extra time to give his side a 2-1 lead. Both teams were unable to score in the second half of extra-time as the match eventually ended 2-1 after 120 minutes. The Pharaohs are now one of the favourite teams to win the 2021 AFCON.
