Former Liverpool midfielder, Danny Murphy, has exposed ‘Arsenal’s biggest problem’ this season under their manager, Mikel Arteta. Murphy also predicted that Arsenal may finish among the top four in the Premier League this season. He stated this ahead of Arsenal’s EFL Cup semi-final tie against Liverpool on Thursday. Arsenal are currently in fourth position on the Premier League table with 35 points from 20 games. But Murphy believes the Gunners will fail to qualify for next season’s Champions League because of their major problem, which is due to their form ‘away from home’. “I think they [Arsenal] have had some performances this season where you see a progression, you see a structure that they have stuck to,” Murphy told talkSport. “There has been a consistency in the team selection, some nice relationships being built, and you can see what they are trying to do. So there is progression. “I think Arsenal’s biggest problem is away from home. At home, they have been okay but away from home, when they come up against decent opposition, they tend to fall short. “I’m talking about [Man] City, [Man] United, Liverpool – losing all those games and not well. “They have not shown enough resilience and confidence and quality to look like they can break into the top four. “At home, they are a better outfit, so their challenge is to take that form onto the road, which is always difficult. “Ultimately, I think they will fall short. I don’t think, even though they are not in Europe, they will end up in the top four.”
