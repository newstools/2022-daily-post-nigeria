Nollywood actress and on-air personality, Toke Makinwa, has denied dragging an Abuja-based business tycoon, Alhaji Aliyu Abubakar to court over unfulfilled promises. Her rebuttal is on the heels of a letter from Femi Falana SAN, lawyer to the businessman, demanding a retraction of the allegations. Abubakar had warned Toke that failure to retract and apologize, she would face a N50 billion lawsuit for defamation of character. The publication had alleged that Toke Makinwa was in a relationship with Abubakar and that she was suing him for unfulfilled promises. However, in a letter of response by her lawyers, Makinwa described the online publication as the handiwork of mischief makers who want to exploit her personality to attract traffic to their online sites. Toke Makinwa in her denial, confessed she had never met the said Alhaji Aliyu Abubakar. The letter signed by Adeyinka Olumide-Fusika SAN, urged the businessman to take action against the malicious online platforms claiming that his client did not have any business with the said interview. “My client, Toke Makinwa is surprised to receive your letter in the above caption dated January 1, 2022, even after she had, on an earlier telephone call on the same issue, told Mr Feml Falana, SAN that she has never heard of your client’s name or his existence as a human being before his phone call ”Perhaps you will consider redirecting your demand letter to the mischievous characters (that is, the online publishers) who, hiding under the anonymity of the internet and obviously aiming to exploit my client’s name and image to attract traffic to their worthless websites, authored and published the fictional association of your client with her, which speaking frankly, demeans her self worth as a woman and insults her psyche as a human being (as may have been the further motive of the fabricators and purveyors} ” the letter read. Meanwhile, Alhaji Aliyu Abubakar in a statement signed by his media aide Kadiri Joseph said he has directed his lawyers to acknowledge receipt of the letter He, however, said considering the gravity of the allegations leveled against him, he would not handle the matter with kids gloves and will be briefing his lawyers on further actions to take.
