A popular Nigerian cleric, Pastor Adewale Giwa, has disclosed that the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, will be set free by President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration after the 2023 general elections. The cleric also revealed that the known face of the agitation for Yoruba Nation, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho, will equally be released from Benin Republic after the polls. Pastor Giwa, who stated this during the weekend, said President Buhari’s administration saw the two agitators as a threat to the 2023 elections. He added that in order not to take chances with the agitation, which has been gathering momentum in the southeast and southwest regions of the country, the Federal Government resolved to arrest them by all possible means and keep them from the public space until after the polls. “They plan to release both Kanu and Sunday Igboho after the 2023 elections. “They see them as threats ahead of the elections,” he said. Recall that Kanu had been in the custody of the Department of State Services, DSS, after he was intercepted in Kenya in June 2021. Igboho, on his part, was arrested on July 19 by operatives of Brigade Criminelle (Criminal Brigade) in Cotonou, Benin Republic, weeks after his house in Ibadan, Oyo State, was raided by DSS operatives.
