Super Eagles interim coach, Austin Eguavoen, has said that he told the players that they have not won anything yet in Cameroon. He also vowed that Nigeria will not look down on Guinea-Bissau when they meet in the final Group D game on Wednesday. Nigeria has brushed aside Egypt and Sudan in their last two matches to accumulate 6 points while Guinea-Bissau need a win to stand a chance of progressing to the last sixteen. Eguavoen, however, vowed that his boys will keep fighting, adding that nobody can conclude that Guinea Bissau is a push over. The 1994 Africa Cup of Nations winner said it was important for the team to keep winning games despite having made it to the round of 16. “Just as I told the boys after the match against Egypt, we are yet to win anything here except points. “Guinea Bissau need the three points because they have only one so far and we must be prepared for a massive fight. “With a little more luck, they could have beaten Sudan and could have drawn with Egypt. That is the kind of opposition we face on Wednesday. Nobody will tell me they’re pushover.”
