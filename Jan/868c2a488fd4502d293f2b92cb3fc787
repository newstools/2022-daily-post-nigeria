Bishop Mike Okonkwo of The Redeemed Evangelical Mission, TREM, has cautioned Nigerians against banking on religion and tribe in deciding Nigeria’s next president. Okonkwo has, however, claimed he does not care if Nigeria’s next president is a Christian or Muslim. Featuring on Arise tv, the founding member of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, PFN, said Nigerians should pick a president who can deliver on the dividends of democracy. He said: “We must rid ourselves of party politics, religious politics and personal interests as long as the politics of this nation is concerned and focus on who can deliver to us the dividends of democracy. “I don’t care whether he is a Christian or a Muslim, but who actually is interested in this country and has a multitude of them across the length and breadth of Nigeria. “We have done this thing for too long. Religious politics, party politics, tribal politics, where has it led us? For me, it’s time to come to the drawing board and admit that we have failed and start doing the right things.”
