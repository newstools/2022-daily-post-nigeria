Everton will hold further talks with Frank Lampard, as it emerged the Chelsea legend has become the leading candidate to replace Rafa Benitez as manager. SportsMail reports that Lampard has already held conversations with Goodison chiefs. Those negotiations are expected to accelerate over the next 24 hours. No appointment is imminent, but if talks go well with Lampard, he could land the job ahead of Vitor Pereira. Everton wants a new manager in place before the weekend, especially as the transfer window closes on Monday night. Pereira had emerged as Everton’s number one choice to take the head coach vacancy. The former Porto boss arrived in the UK earlier this week to effectively seal his appointment. However, protests from supporters against his appointment have put Pereira’s job hopes in jeopardy.
