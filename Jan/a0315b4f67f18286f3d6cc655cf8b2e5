Anambra State Governor-elect, Prof Charles Chukwuma Soludo has said that his manifesto for the state is not just a tool to lure the people into voting him into power, but a social contract with the people of the state. Soludo stated this in his address during a ceremony put together for the inauguration of the transition committee. He restated his vision for Anambra’s transformation, promising to ensure its realization. The Governor-elect, while addressing a cross-section of the Anambra Transition Committee and Handover Committee at Golden Tulip Hotel, Agulu, informed them that the work at hand is huge and his vision for a better, newer, liveable and industrialised Anambra is achievable and efforts must be put in place to bring it to reality. “My manifesto is not just for campaign but a contract I have signed with Ndi Anambra and since they have chosen me amongst all the other qualified candidates that contested the last election, I’m committed to undertake the transformation of Anambra and ensure impactful leadership and there is no stopping of my work plan for a better Anambra. “Anambra must be transformed to that mega industrialised economy, our roads both in the rural areas and cities, markets, environment challenges must be addressed,” he said.
