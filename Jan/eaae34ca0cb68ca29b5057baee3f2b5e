The World Health Organization (WHO) says Omicron is currently the dominant COVID-19 variant in Nigeria. On Thursday, the body said 30 African countries, and at least 142 worldwide, had detected the strain. The Delta variant has been reported in 42 African nations, according to the United Nations (UN) health agency. “Omicron sequences in Cabo Verde, Ghana, Nigeria and Senegal are growing. Omicron is currently the dominant variant in both Cabo Verde and Nigeria”, it noted. WHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti said early indications suggest the continent’s fourth wave had been steep, brief, but no less destabilising. North and West Africa are seeing a rise in infections; North Africa reported a 121 per cent increase in the last seven days. Moeti stressed that the crucial pandemic countermeasure badly needed in Africa still stands. “That is rapidly and significantly increasing COVID-19 vaccinations. The next wave may not be so forgiving”, the official warned.
