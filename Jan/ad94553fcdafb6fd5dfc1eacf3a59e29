Fiorentina striker, Dusan Vlahovic, is set for a shock move to Arsenal as according to reports. Vlahovic is among the four strikers Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta reportedly shortlisted to replace deposed Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, at Emirates. Aubameyang has not been selected by Arteta after he was punished for a ‘disciplinary breach’. The Gabon international has since been exiled from Arsenal’s first-team and is reportedly willing to leave the North London club this January transfer window. According to Gazzetta dello Sport, Arsenal have submitted an offer of £45.8m plus Lucas Torreira to Fiorentina for Vlahovic’s signature. The Gunners value the deal overall at €70m and are hopeful that the offer will be enough to convince the Serie A side to sell the 21-year-old this month. Vlahovic is one of Serie A’s most in-demand strikers, having scored 16 goals in 19 league appearances so far this season. He has also drawn the interest of Tottenham Hotspur.
