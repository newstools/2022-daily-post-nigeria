The Progressives Governors Forum (PGF) has promised that the party’s national convention to elect new leaders will hold in February. PGF is a body of governors elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), The Chairman, Atiku Bagudu addressed journalists after a meeting of the body in Abuja, Sunday night. The Yobe Governor said the February timeframe as approved by President Muhammadu Buhari was sacrosanct and would be respected. He added that APC Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) was in the best position to announce the specific date. “We are one group of stakeholders and our party respects institutions. The appropriate organ of the party that will announce a date for the national convention is the CECPC”, he said. “We discussed our upcoming convention which I had the cause to address the press after visiting President Buhari in November 2021. He and the party agreed that the convention would take place in February. “We took inputs about the reviews and we noted all the misrepresentations in the press that we seek to correct that the PGF is one united body as you can see evidently from the attendance,” Bagudu said. Governors of Borno, Babagana Zulum; Jigawa, Mohammed Abubakar; Ondo, Rotimi Akeredolu; Niger, Abubakar Bello; Kaduna, Nasir El-Rufai; Ekiti Kayode Fayemi; Kogi, Yahaya Bello; Ogun, Dapo Abiodun; Kano, Abdullahi Ganduje, among others, were at the parley. Salihu Lukman, PGF Director-General, is one of the party chieftains opposed to further postponement of the convention. The DG recently wrote a letter to Bagudu, warning of the consequences of failure to hold the event next month.
