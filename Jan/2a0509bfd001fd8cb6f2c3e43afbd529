Manchester United full-back, Diogo Dalot, has revealed the only thing interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, wants from Manchester United players, including Cristiano Ronaldo and Paul Pogba. Dalot said Rangnick wants to get ‘the best out’ of each Manchester United player at Old Trafford this season. He explained that the German’s philosophy is very good in terms of the way he communicates with Man United players and the way he expresses his thoughts to them. Dalot said this ahead of Man United’s FA Cup third-round tie with Aston Villa on Monday. “Every time you change managers, it is a new opportunity and a new experience,” Dalot told Man United’s official website. “He [Ralf Rangnick] is a very experienced coach with a lot of years in football. “His philosophy is very good in terms of the way that he communicates with everyone and the way he expresses his thoughts to us. “I think the manager wants to get the best out of each player and, for me, it is about bringing my best qualities into every game.”
