Leicester City striker, Ashieigh Plumptre, has completed a switch to Nigeria. Plumptre has been given the approval by FIFA to switch her allegiance to the Super Falcons after representing England on youth level. The 23-year-old Leicester City defender is eligible to play for Nigeria because of her father’s Nigerian heritage. Plumptre, who had joined Nigeria’s training camps in Austria and Abuja, is now free to lace her boots for Nigeria following Fifa’s approval. She would hope to be part of Nigeria’s squad for the 2022 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations play-off against Ivory Coast in February. “We are happy to receive Ashleigh’s official clearance from Fifa,” NFF director of communications Ademola Olajire told BBC Sport Africa. “It was only possible because of her commitment and dedication. She made the federation’s work a lot easier by providing all the requirements in quick time. “Ashleigh personally approached the English FA directly to get the required international clearance from that end. “Her professionalism and unflinching desire to play for Nigeria is honestly heart-warming….” Another Leicester City star, Ademola Lookman could not be included in the Super Eagles’ final list for the 2022 African Cup of Nations in Cameroon due to FIFA’s clearance which has not been completed at the moment.
