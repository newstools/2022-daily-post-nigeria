The Yobe State Police Command has said its operatives have apprehended a 35-year-old notorious suspect, Usman Ali, over theft, burglary and trespassing in Damaturu and its environs. The command’s Public Relations Officer, ASP Dungus Abdulkarim, in a statement on Saturday, noted that the culprit was on the 7th January 2022, at about 0600hrs, arrested by police detectives of the Crack Squad Unit after responding to a distress call from the Ward Head of Marfa-Kallam Village, Damaturu, where over four houses were broken into and valuables carted away in one night. He added that the suspect is a member of a syndicate, who specialises in breaking into unsuspecting victims’ houses at night to steal valuables ranging from cell phones, Tv sets, money, jewellery, among others. “The culprit and his cohorts most often patronize Indomie noodles joints, tea sellers spots or sometimes hang around with friends in target areas of crimes to observe the movement of people and other security measures and when it is getting dark in the evening they hibernate in some secluded location and come out at midnight to perpetrate their heinous activities. “They usually operate within the hours of 0200hrs to 0300hrs by sneaking quietly into houses with doors, windows or penetrable openings”, ASP Abdulkarim said. According to him, the command has been trailing the culprit and other syndicate members for a while. “The case is currently under investigation, while efforts are made to arrest other fleeing syndicate members”, he said. Abdulkarim commended the cooperation of communities in the state for ensuring public peace and safety. He appealed for more support to sustain the continued efforts in combating crimes and criminality in the state.
