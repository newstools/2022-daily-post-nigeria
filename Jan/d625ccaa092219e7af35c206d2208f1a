The All Progressives Congress (APC) has refuted media reports that the ruling party has suspended its national convention slated for February. The National Secretary of APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Sen. John Akpanudoedehe disclosed this in a statement issued on Wednesday. The ruling party, however, said its priority was to address the fallout of recently conducted congresses and litigations against the party. The secretary noted that the faceless authors and sponsors of fake news on APC activities, especially the planned National Convention are simply bent on causing confusion and fomenting crisis through misinformation. ”We should not enable them he said. Akpanudoedehe noted, “The general public is advised to completely disregard fake news on the reported suspension of the planned National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) till June, as reported by some media outlets.” He said the Caretaker Committee was already embarking on nationwide consultations with party stakeholders to prepare the ground for a rancour-free National Convention. The secretary said it was based on this that the sub-committee on budgeting and other substructures would be set up in due course. Akpanudoedehe stressed that dates for party activities such as meetings, primaries, congresses, National Conventions are communicated through well-known official channels and not through ‘sources’. “Finally, the party notes and appreciates the continued support of well-meaning members and leaders as the APC Caretaker Committee undertakes the immediate task of addressing contestations within the party, litigations, fallouts of recently-conducted Congresses and generally reposition the party ahead of the National Convention.” Akpanudoedehe said as a focus-driven, process-oriented political party, the APC Caretaker Committee under the leadership of Governor Mai Mala Buni would not be distracted by the self-serving antics of these sponsors of fake news.
