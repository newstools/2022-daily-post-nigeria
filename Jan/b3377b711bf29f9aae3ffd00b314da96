Ekiti Governor, Kayode Fayemi and his predecessor, Ayo Fayose met at the state capital, Ado Ekiti, on Thursday. Others were Governors of Jigawa, Mohammed Abubakar; and Akwa Ibom, Emmanuel Udom. Fayose and Emmanuel are Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) members; Fayemi and Abubakar are of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Photos of their meeting are being interpreted differently on social media. In a Facebook post, Fayose explained that he was at the Government House to see off Emmanuel, who superintended over the PDP primary election. He said Fayemi and Badaru, APC Electoral Panel Chairman for Ekiti primary election, “saw us to the Helipad where Gov Emmanuel’s helicopter departed.” “These clarifications become necessary before the “political analysts” start their commentations.” The PDP exercise produced Bisi Kolawole as the party’s governorship candidate for the June 18 poll.
