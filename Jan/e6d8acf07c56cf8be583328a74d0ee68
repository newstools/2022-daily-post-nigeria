All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain, Patrick Obahiagbon has charged President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) leadership to take decisive actions ahead of 2023. Obahiagbon made the call in a letter to Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, who is Chairman of APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC). The former House of Representatives member says the party needs to chart a pathway to guide the party as the general elections draw near. He advised against personal wishes and ambitions that could override the common goal of the ruling platform. Obahiagbon maintains party interest is paramount than “parochial and self-centred agitations from a microscopic few”. He expressed worry that the APC was “largely fractious and tottering at its perilous precipice and brinks”. The ex-Chief of Staff to former Edo Governor, Adams Oshiomhole, told Buni that destiny and history beckons on him to provide leadership for all. Obahiagbon, however, hailed the Yobe Governor for his style, consultative approach “coruscating humility and visceral connectivity”. “It’s the considered opinion of the majority of members that Your Excellency has not only steered the party away from avoidable cataracts and icebergs but also enviably returned our party to winning ways and glorious path”, he wrote.
