Following the kidnap of another paramount ruler of Vwang District in Jos South Local Government Area of Plateau State, Da Gyang Ballat, on Sunday night, member representing Jos South/Jos East Federal Constituency of the state in the National Assembly, Hon. Dachung Musa Bagos, has tasked security agents to ensure the monarch’s immediate release. The lawmaker regretted the kidnap of the monarch barely a month after the kidnap and release of another traditional ruler in the state, HRH Charles Dakat. Hon. Bagos, reacting in a press statement on Monday by his media assistant, Danja Yakubu, observed that kidnappers have turned their focus on traditional rulers. The statement said: “It’s unfortunate, a situation where traditional rulers who are the custodians of the people are now target of kidnappers.” Bagos insisted that the kidnappers must be brought to justice, encouraging the residents to offer useful information to security agents. Da Gyang Balak, Gwom Rwei of Vwang District, Jos South Local Government of Plateau State was on his way home from Vom, a few meters from the gate of the National Institute For Policy and Strategic Studies, Kuru in Jos when the kidnappers struck. According to the statement, the Plateau State Police Command Public Relations Officer, ASP Gabriel Ubah, confirmed the incident. Vwang District is where the famous National Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI) and the Federal College of Soil and Land Resources Technology are situated in the state.
