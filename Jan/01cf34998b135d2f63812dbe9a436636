The federal high court in Abuja has granted the self-acclaimed leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu three days to present his case for fresh bail and to challenge the competence of the fresh terrorism charges brought against him by the federal government. A 7-count terrorism charge was on Thursday, October 21, 2021, slammed on Kanu in which he pleaded not guilty and opted to challenge the validity of the alleged heinous crimes. A hearing notice issued by the federal high court for the determination of the two motions filed by Kanu and sighted by DAILY POST on Sunday indicated that three days have been earmarked for the matter. The hearing notice served on the federal government through the Federal Ministry of Justice and to Kanu through his lawyer, Ifeanyi Ejiofor fixed January 18, 19 and 20, 2022 consecutively for the disposal of the two motions. Nnamdi Kanu is also expected to use the three days to challenge the court’s jurisdiction to try him on the terrorism charge on the grounds that the alleged offences were committed in the United Kingdom and not in Nigeria. His lawyer, Mr Ifeanyi Ejiofor confirmed to DAILY POST that the hearing notice has been served on him and that the legal team is fully prepared for the task before Justice Binta Nyako. Kanu was in June 2021 re-arrested in Kenya and extradited to Nigeria to face trial and had since been confined to the detention facility of the Department of the State Service DSS in Abuja on the order of the court. He was first arrested in a Lagos hotel in 2015 by operatives of the Department of State Service (DSS) and was arraigned alongside four others in 2016. Among others, Kanu is objecting to the charge on the grounds that it did not in any way link him with the offence and that the alleged offences were even committed in the United Kingdom.
