Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has cautioned the federal government against removing oil subsidies. There is apprehension over the National Economic Council (NEC) recommendation of N302 per litre of petrol. Ikechukwu Nwafor, Ebonyi NLC chairman told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday that the government should reconsider its proposed action. He warned that another increment in pump price would worsen the economic situation millions are enduring The labour leader said the nation’s refineries should be fixed to put an end to importation. “This is not the right time to increase pump price when the cost of living is difficult. Prices of food commodities are already beyond the capacity of civil servants. “How will the civil servants, who are the engine of the economy, cope? We are telling the federal government to consider the consequences of the increase on the masses and the economy.” Nwafor added that government decision would affect transportation, food items, clothing, housing, among others, if it goes into effect. On the protest scheduled for January 27, the NLC chairman confirmed members were prepared to come out in opposition. “We have mobilised and we have had a series of meetings. We will continue to meet for proper planning”, he disclosed.
