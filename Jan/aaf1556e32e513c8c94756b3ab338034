Political parties have been urged to grant full financial waivers to women contesting for political positions in 2023. The wife of the Minister for Transportation, Judith Amaechi, who made the appeal on Wednesday, identified finance as a major challenge facing participation of women in Nigerian politics. According to a statement issued by her media aide, Dike Bekwele, the former First Lady of Rivers, spoke at a two-day APC Progressives Women Conference in Abuja. She called on political parties to, as a matter of policy, review the financial involvement of women and grant full financial waivers to encourage full women participation in elections. Amaechi expressed concern that most women with intellectual and leadership capacities have stayed away from politics and political contests due to huge financial responsibility.
