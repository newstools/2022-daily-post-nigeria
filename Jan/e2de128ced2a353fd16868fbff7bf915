A source from the area said no casualty was recorded during the fierce fight between the two sides only for the bandits to return on Monday to block the Kontagora road around Kwanan Dutse. Unaware of the development the patrol team ran into the ambush and a fire fight ensued. The source said,” the exchange of gunfire between the bandits and the Joint Security TaskForce resulted in the death of three policemen and two local vigilantes while others sustained various degrees of injury” “A number of the gunmen were also killed in the gunfight but their bodies were quickly evacuated by their members on motorcycles”. However, a detachment of police tactical squad and the military have been drafted to the area and are on the trail of the criminals.
