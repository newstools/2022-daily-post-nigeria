The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has insisted that the party had not zoned the 2023 presidential ticket to the North. DAILY POST reports that this is coming after Babangida Aliyu, a former governor of Niger State, had said that the party had zoned the 2023 presidential ticket to the North. Aliyu had on Friday when members of the Atiku Support Organisation visited him in Minna, said the PDP had zoned its presidential ticket to the North. He said the party decided to rezone the presidency to the North following requests from some Nigerians. However, in a statement on Saturday titled, “We have not zoned our presidential ticket,’’ by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, the PDP described Aliyu’s statement as misleading. It also urged Nigerians to disregard Aliyu’s statement, saying it didn’t represent the PDP’s position on the issue. The statement partly read, “The attention of the Peoples Democratic Party has been drawn to comments and speculations from certain individuals claiming that our party has zoned its presidential ticket to a particular part of the country. This is completely misleading as it does not in any way represent the position of our party. “For the avoidance of doubt, the PDP emphatically and unequivocally states that it has not zoned its presidential ticket to any part of the country. The PDP, therefore, urges Nigerians, our teeming members and supporters to completely disregard the unfounded zoning claims as being peddled. Our party also cautions those behind the claims to desist forthwith.”
