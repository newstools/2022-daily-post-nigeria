Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom has commended the President Muhammadu Buhari led administration for heeding his call and finally labelling bandits wreaking havoc on citizens across the country as terrorists, Ortom, however, claims labelling only bandits as terrorists ”was not enough.” The governor, in a statement by his spokesman, Nathaniel Ikyur asked the President to be bold enough to go a step further and declare Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, MACBAN and Fulani Nationality Movement, FUNAM as terrorist organisations just as it has done to other groups. Ortom who was reacting to President Buhari interview on Channels Television insisted that the step taken by the federal government now would go a long way to contain the atrocities of the criminals and give citizens opportunities to go about their legitimate businesses unmolested. The Governor said, “even though the federal government’s measures on bandits now seems strong, the security challenges will only be adequately addressed if a similar hard position is taken on Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, MACBAN and the Fulani Nationality Movement (FUNAM) who have vowed and continued to cause mayhem in Benue State and other parts of the country because of the anti-grazing laws.” “For us in Benue State, the law has come to stay. It is irrevocable. In fact, we have maintained our position that Benue State has no grazing routes, reserves or areas whatsoever. It was enacted in good faith for peace and order in the state. It was done among other things to end the incessant farmers/herdsmen clashes in the state.”
