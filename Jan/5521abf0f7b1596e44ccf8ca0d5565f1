The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), on Friday, finally suspended Burkina Faso from its governing bodies. The Authority of ECOWAS Heads of State and Government made the decision at the end of its virtual summit on the situation in Burkina Faso on Friday. The resolutions of the ECOWAS Presidents were contained in a communique issued at the end of the virtual summit made available to newsmen. DAILY POST reports that this is coming after the coup d’etat carried out last Sunday that toppled the democratically elected government of President Roch Kabore. The ECOWAS Presidents, who condemned the coup d’état, frowned at the resurgence of coup d’états in member countries, insisting that ECOWAS will no longer tolerate ascending to power through unconstitutional means. The communique partly reads, “the Authority, during deliberations, strongly condemns the coup d’etat and expresses deep concern over the resurgence of military coups in the region. “Following the coup d’etat in Mali on August 18, 2020, in Guinea on September 5, 2021, and in Burkina Faso on January 24, 2022. “The coup d’etat in Burkina Faso was organized by obtaining the resignation of President Roch Marc Christian Kabore under duress. “The leadership demands the immediate release and protection of President Roch Marc Christian Kabore and all the other political detainees. “They also decided to suspend Burkina Faso from all ECOWAS Institutions.” It also demanded the quick restoration of constitutional order by the militaries and urged them to remain republican by focusing on their duty of safeguarding the territorial integrity of Burkina Faso.
