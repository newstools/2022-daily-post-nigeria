Manchester United defender, Phil Jones, has decided to turn down an offer to leave Old Trafford for Bordeaux. Man United had reached an agreement with Bordeaux for Jones to join the French Ligue 1 side, but the 29-year-old rejected the proposal. This was disclosed by transfer expert, Fabrizio Romano, via his Twitter handle on Monday. According to Romano, Bordeaux will try a final attempt today (transfer deadline day) to change Jones’ mind. He tweeted: “Bordeaux will try to do a final attempt today to change Phil Jones’ mind, after English defender turned down the proposal to join Bordeaux on loan from Man United. “Seems still difficult for Bordeaux – the other option is Andreas Maxsø from Brøndby. #DeadlineDay.”
