Random search of phones and laptops of persons by policemen in Ilorin, Kwara State capital, has continued despite the order by the state Police Commissioner, Tuesday Assayomo, banning the action. In the latest incident, which occurred on Friday, one Adeyemi was stopped by a police patrol team in a pickup vehicle at the Ola-Olu Hospital area of Ilorin and had his phone seized. The man, who was driving a Toyota Camry car, was accused of being a ‘Yahoo’ boy and allegedly asked to pay N10,000 to regain his freedom. The man was eventually taken to the state police command headquarters in Ilorin following his refusal to pay the amount. The intervention of the Head of Investigation, Public Complaint Commission, in Ilorin, Barrister Sunday Olorunponle Steven, however, rescued the man from the policemen. The spokesman of the state police command, Mr Okasanmi Ajayi, could not be reached at the time of this report. DAILY POST recalls that on November 4, 2021, the state police commissioner banned policemen from randomly searching phones and laptops of persons in the state. A statement by the command’s spokesman, Okasanmi Ajayi, had said such actions could only be carried out “if the telephones and laptops are products of investigations approved by the Commissioner of Police himself.” The statement directed members of the public to report any contrary action against the order to the Police Commissioner through 08033454228, 08032365122 pr 08125275046. The order was sequel to several daunting complaints from the members of the public who accused some policemen on patrol around Maraba junction axis in Ilorin of harassing innocent residents and forcing them to submit their phones for search without committing any offence.
