Cameroon finished as winners of Group A at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, despite a 1-1 draw with Cape Verde Islands on Monday. Captain of the Indomitable Lions, Vincent Aboubakar, netted his fifth goal of the tournament to give the hosts the lead with six minutes left before half time. However, halftime substitute Garry Rodrigues levelled in the 53rd minute. Rodrigues’ audacious back flick ensured Cape Verde finished with four points in third place in the standings. They are likely to advance as one of four best third placed finishers. Burkina Faso finished second, also with four points, after a 1-1 draw with Ethiopia in the other Group A match.
