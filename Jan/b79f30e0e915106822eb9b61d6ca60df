Governor Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State has ordered the immediate reopening of all fuelling stations and cattle markets closed down earlier due to menace of banditry and cattle rustling experienced in the state. Masari, however, charged all district and village heads in the affected areas of the two Emirate Councils in the state “to be wary and vigilant in order to ensure that no act of connivance by the ‘Sarkin Fawa’ is allowed.” The order was disclosed in a statement forwarded to DAILY POST on Saturday by Abdullahi Yar’adua, the Director of Press to the Secretary of the Government of the State SGS, Mustapha Inuwa. The Katsina Governor stressed that his government would not hesitate to re-enact the closure where a resurgence of any dubious activity is noticed. Recall that in August 2021, the state government in its bid to curtail the security menace in the state signed into law the Security Challenges Containment Order” which includes the closure of some fuelling stations and cattle markets in areas suffering from banditry in the state.
