Napoli striker, Victor Osimhen, has hailed his Nigerian teammates following their 1-0 win over Egypt on Tuesday. The Super Eagles kicked off their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations campaign with a victory over the seven-time champions. Kelechi Iheanacho netted the decisive goal in the 30th minute of the encounter. Osimhen, writing on Twitter, urged his colleagues to build on the win ahead of their next group game against Sudan this weekend. “Congratulations guys, amazing performance. We continue to build on this momentum,” he wrote. Osimhen is not with the squad in Cameroon after his Serie A club blocked him from joining up.
