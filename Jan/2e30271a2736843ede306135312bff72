Francis Uzoho replaces Maduka Okoye in goal, while the back four is comprised of Tyronne Ebuehi, Jamiu Collins, Semi Ajayi and William Troost-Ekong, who captains the team. Wilfred Ndidi and Kelechi Nwakali start in midfield, while Kelechi Iheanacho is just ahead of them. The front three is Chidera Ejuke, Alex Iwobi and Umar Sadiq. Kick off is 8pm. Nigeria XI vs Guinea-Bissau: Uzoho, Ebuehi, Collins, Ajayi, Troost-Ekong, Wilfred Ndidi, Nwakali, Iheanacho, Ejuke, Iwobi and Sadiq.
