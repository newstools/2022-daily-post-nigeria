The Spiritual Director of the Adoration Ministry Enugu, Rev. Father Ejike Mbaka has warned that if anything happens to the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, the country would collapse. In a video making the rounds on social media, the controversial cleric, who was speaking during a sermon at the adoration ground, warned the Department of State Services, DSS, and the Federal Government against maltreating the secessionist. Mbaka, who explained that the IPOB leader is agitating for secession due to bad governance by wicked politicians in the country, said the FG should rather fix the problems that metamorphosed into secession agitation. He said, “The DSS people and the government of this country should better handle Nnamdi Kanu’s case with care; if anything happens to that young man in their hand, this country will collapse. “Nnamdi Kanu’s reaction and intervention is as a result of bad government due to wicked leadership. By now, all the political leaders are supposed to be under DSS cell because of what they have done to Nigerians. “Nnamdi is just an agitator and he is agitating because of something. Let them solve the problems”. DAILY POST reports that Nnamdi Kanu since June 2021, has been in the custody of the Nigerian secret police following his rearrest from an undisclosed country to continue his trial. Kanu, who jumped bail in 2017, is currently facing his trial which bothers on treasonable felony. President Muhammadu Buhari, on Wednesday, during an interview with Channels Television, vowed that he would not release the agitator, saying he should continue his trial in the court.
