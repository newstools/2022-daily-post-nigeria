President of the Senate, Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan on Monday tasked all Federal government revenue agencies to generate N3 trillion for 2022. Lawan said revenue agencies of government are capable of generating N3 trillion annually to fund the budget if wastage going on in Ministries, Departments Agencies are curtailed and leakages blocked. He said this in his address to declare open an interactive session “on the need to improve internally generated revenue of the Federal Government of Nigeria and Revenue Projections of the Agencies as Contained in the Appropriation Act 2022.” The meeting was at the instance of the Senate Committee on Finance chaired by Senator Solomon Adeola Olamilekan. Lawan pointed out that one of the reasons for the meeting with heads of MDAs was to shore up revenue of the nation, adding that the upper legislative chamber will be strict in over sighting revenue agencies in 2022 as government cannot afford to run on deficit. He expressed optimism that if waste was curtailed with more funds coming into the coffers of the Federal government, it would lessen the level of external borrowings. He, however, maintained that, in being strict with agencies of government, the National Assembly would provide the needed legislative support to the agencies to enable them discharge their responsibilities with ease. Lawan said: “In 2022, the National Assembly assumed and rightly so, that our government-owned enterprises can generate up to N3 trillion if we are of the mindset that we can achieve that and, of course, ensure that we oversight to stall any possibility of unwarranted expenditures by agencies of government. “But that does not mean in any way that it is going to be some kind of investigation on what you do, but an encouragement of what you need to do.”
