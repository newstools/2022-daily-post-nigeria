Plateau State Government has threatened to seal filling stations hoarding petrol. Prof. Danladi Atu, Secretary to the State Government, gave the warning in a statement on Thursday. The authorities strongly condemned the hardship motorists are enduring due to artificial scarcity. Atu announced that the Committee on Road Traffic Administration and Vehicle Inspectors have been tasked to monitor filling stations. “The task force has been directed to seal off any station found hoarding the product and auction same”, the SSG said. There have been long queues in the nation’s capital, Abuja, and some states since late 2021. In November, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) allayed fears of an increase in pump price and advised against panic buying.
