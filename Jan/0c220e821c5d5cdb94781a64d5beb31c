Premier League fixtures will no longer be postponed, except the club requesting for it show four positive COVID-19 cases. The 20 top-flight clubs reached this agreement on Wednesday. This comes after a series of controversial decisions to call off matches. Clubs have used a combination of COVID-19, injuries, suspensions and players on international duty to postpone games. In total, 22 matches have been moved in the Premier League this season. The last match to be called off was Arsenal’s trip to Tottenham Hotspur for the North London Derby. The new guidance will come into effect ahead of the next Premier League fixture on Saturday, February 5 when Burnley host Watford. It has also been announced that fans will no longer need to show Covid passports when attending Premier League matches.
