Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Cross River State, Venatius Ikem has flayed Governor Benedict Ayade over his pronouncement that he has zoned governorship to the southern senatorial district of the state. In an exclusive chat, Ikem said Ayade is not realistic with his pronouncement. “I don’t believe Governor Ayade is poised for any such thing. The events in a few weeks and months ahead will bear me out,” he said. According to him, the Governor has lost grip of the political process and is only hanging on to the threads of what he thinks to be popular opinion to claim some semblance of support. “I challenge him to stop aspirants from other zones from contesting for the ticket of his party. I challenge him to stop some of his closest allies from contesting in compliance with his avowed stand on zoning. “If he cannot convince his close allies then clearly I will tell anyone who believes his stand on zoning as unrealistic and asleep. We need to wake such a one from sleep,” he added. However, Governor Ayade again vowed that he will do everything possible to ensure that fairness is followed in choosing his successor from Cross River South. “I have not changed my mind. My position and that of the party is for fairness and moral conscience to prevail. Power should return to the south. It is only fair that we do so,” he said.
