Justice M. T. M. Aliyu of the Kaduna State High Court on Monday convicted a serial fraudster, Gabriel Chimezie. He was prosecuted by the Kano Zonal Command of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Chimezie was arraigned on a four-count charge of obtaining by false pretence. He had been convicted twice by the same court on similar charges and was serving a term in prison. Chimezie, Stephen Olaika and Francis Chukwu (deceased) duped the complainant of N1,475,000 over a purported contract to supply Solar Halogen Indicator. The convict and accomplices claimed they knew the victim from his time at the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria. After pleading not guilty, prosecution counsel, Musa Isah, called four witnesses and tendered several documents admitted in evidence. Justice Aliyu convicted and sentenced Chimezie to seven years imprisonment on each of the four counts without the option of a fine. The jail terms will run concurrently.
