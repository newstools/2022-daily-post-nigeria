Suspended ex-Head of the Intelligence Response Team, DCP Abba Kyari, has been spotted at the wedding of Maina, son of the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba. Businessman, Aliko Dangote; Senate President, Ahmad Lawan; Aviation Minister, Hadi Sirika; popular socialite, Obinna Iyiegbu, aka Obi Cubana, amongst others were also at the event. The wedding took place in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State. Kyari, who has been off social media for months, took to his verified Facebook page to post over 400 photos after the ceremony. A Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agent, Andrew Innocenti, had alleged that Kyari was contracted by Ramon Abbas aka Hushpuppi after a “co-conspirator” Chibuzo Vincent threatened to expose an alleged $1.1m fraud committed against a Qatari businessman. Innocenti, who claimed to be in possession of voice calls and WhatsApp conversations between Kyari and Hushpuppi, also alleged that the suspected fraudster paid the police officer N8m for the arrest and detention of Vincent. Kyari had taken to Facebook on July 29, 2021, to deny the allegations but he later deleted the post. The IGP had in August 2021, set up a Special Investigation Panel headed by the Deputy Inspector-General of Police in charge of the Force Criminal Investigations Department, Joseph Egbunike, to look into the allegations. Egbunike submitted the panel’s report, which he said, “is an outcome of a painstaking, transparent and exhaustive investigative process.” Baba also claimed he is yet to receive a formal extradition request from the FBI for Kyari, following his indictment by a US court.
