Arsenal are angry with striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang after he flew to Barcelona in a bid to complete a loan move to the Spanish club. The Gunners claim the 32-year-old was not given permission to make the trip ahead of transfer deadline day. The Premier League club has now made it clear that they will not pay any part of Aubameyang’s wages. This was revealed by Italian transfer expert, Fabrizio Romano. Romano tweeted: “Arsenal have made clear to Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang few minutes ago that they’ve no intention to collaborate or pay part of his salary for Barça. “It’s up to Barça and Aubameyang to find a solution or it’s collapsed – and Dembélé is not going to Arsenal.” Barca directors are still working out ways how they can fit the 32-year-old into their salary cap. The Gabon international is willing to take a reduction in his estimated £350,000-a-week salary to make it happen if necessary.
