Real Madrid forward, Karim Benzema, has admitted winning this year’s Ballon d’Or prize remains his priority. According to the France international, winning means several different things to him. Benzema finished behind Chelsea’s Jorginho, Bayern Munich’s Robert Lewandowski and winner, Paris Saint-Germain superstar Lionel Messi.
But he has now said: “Finishing 4th, 3rd, 2nd or 30th… it’s all the same, what counts is winning. “For me, the Ballon d’Or is for players who carry their team, score during difficult moments and win trophies. “My chances of winning the Ballon d’Or in 2022? Why not? We could set it as an objective. I will do everything possible to play better than I did last season.” The 33-year-old almost led Los Blancos to the LaLiga title last season, scoring 23 goals. They missed out by two points to city rivals Atletico Madrid. Benzema also led the France national team to the UEFA Nations League this year.
