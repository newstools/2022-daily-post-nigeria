Joe Igbokwe, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has opened up on a “conflict of choice” between Bola Tinubu, the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. Igbokwe said the APC would decide who would emerge as its flagbearer in the 2023 presidential election. The Special Adviser for Drainage and Water Resources to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, made the comments while appearing on Arise TV’s Morning Programme. He, however, vowed to vote Tinubu if the national leader of the APC clinches the party’s presidential candidate. Asked if there will not be a conflict of choice between Osinbajo and Tinubu’s followers, Igbokwe said, “It is the party that will decide, we will go to the national convention, whoever emerges, we’ll support that person because only one candidate will be fielded by the APC; it can be Asiwaju (Tinubu), it can be Osinbajo, it can be Umahi but as I speak to you now, my voter card is in my pocket and I am going to use it to vote for Asiwaju if he wins the primary.” Tinubu, Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State, and Orji Uzor Kalu; Senate Chief Whip has all declared their intention to run for President in 2023. However, Osinbajo is yet to disclose his decision as far as the 2023 Presidential election is concerned.
