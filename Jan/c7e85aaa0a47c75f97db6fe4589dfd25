Liverpool have confirmed that centre-back, Morgan Boyes, has completed a permanent transfer to Scottish Premiership club Livingston. Boyes joined Liverpool’s Academy at U11 level and progressed to become a regular for the Reds’ U23s side after being part of the FA Youth Cup-winning squad in 2019. The Wales U21 international spent the first half of the 2020-21 season on loan at Fleetwood Town before returning to Merseyside. Liverpool disclosed this in a post via their website ahead of their Carabao Cup semi-final first-leg tie with Arsenal on Thursday night. However, the Carabao Cup was postponed due to the increasing number of suspected positive COVID-19 cases among Liverpool’s players and staff. Meanwhile, Arsenal have confirmed that their 22-year-old defender, Jonathan Dinzeyi, has been recalled from his loan spell with Carlisle United. Dinzeyi spent the first half of the season with League Two side Carlisle United. The former England Youth international made three first-team appearances for Carlisle.
