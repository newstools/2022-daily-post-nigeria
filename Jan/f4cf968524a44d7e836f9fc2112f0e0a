Tottenham Hotspur manager, Antonio Conte, has said it will be “emotional” to return to Stamford Bridge for the first time since he left Chelsea in 2018. Conte takes his team to face the Blues in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final. The Italian spent two years in charge of Chelsea, before he was sacked and left for Inter Milan. During his first spell in England, Conte won the Premier League and FA Cup. “It will be great to come back to Stamford Bridge. It’s the first time since I left Chelsea. “What I can say is I spent two amazing seasons, I created a lot of friendships in the club. We did a really important, good job. I also enjoyed the work there. “I have to say thanks to Chelsea because they gave me the possibility to work in England. It will be good and emotional to come back to Stamford Bridge. “But now I am the manager of Tottenham and I want to give this club 100 per cent,” Conte said.
