Sudan head coach, Burhan Tia, has tipped Nigeria and Cameroon to go all the way at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. Both countries finished the group stages strongly as other big names struggled. The Indomitable Lions topped Group A with seven points, while the Super Eagles claimed maximum points in Group D. Tia came up against Nigeria in their second fixture and lost 3-1. He believes that Augustine Eguavoen’s men have what it takes to be champions again. “Could Egypt or Nigeria be champions? “Both teams are very good and both played good football in the group. “They are two teams who could go very far in the competition,” Tia told Goal. Sudan ended their AFCON campaign with a narrow 1-0 defeat to Egypt.
