Governor of Niger State, Abubakar Bello, has endorsed the presidential aspiration of former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu. Bello said Nigeria needs someone like Tinubu, who changed Lagos, as a president, adding that Nigeria needs a President with such vision. Bello said this while receiving Tinubu in Minna on Thursday. The governor applauded the All Progressives Congress (APC) leader for changing Lagos to what it is today. Bello said he wants the presidential aspirant to replicate the developmental strides at the national level. He said, “I am looking forward to seeing you lay the kind of foundation you laid for the massive transformation in Lagos for Nigeria. “Lagos is a country within a country and we saw the foundation you laid there, we are looking forward to seeing you replicate it for Nigeria.” Bello also hailed Tinubu for donating N50 million to the state for Internally Displaced Persons, while sympathising with the government and people over the incessant attacks in the state.
