The General Overseer, Redeemers Ministry, Reverend Jonathan Mathew, on Saturday in Kaduna, released 15 prophecies. He said the year 2022 shall be the year for total freedom, from oppression, banditry and all forms of criminality. Jonathan, who spoke during the New Year prayer meeting held at the church’s auditorium in Kaduna, noted that those who plan evil against Nigerians will surely be put to shame, as their plans would fail. Speaking on the theme “Repent for the kingdom of God is at hand,” the cleric urged those behind the crisis and criminality in Nigeria to repent, else they will surely pay for their evils. According to him, ” God allows some things to happen so that His name will be glorified.” He added that the killings, banditry and all forms of criminality taking place in various parts of the country will stop, “because very soon, the wraght of God will soon visit those who perpetrated evil.” He admonished Nigerians to always pray, as God’s presence will never depart from those who seek him honestly.
