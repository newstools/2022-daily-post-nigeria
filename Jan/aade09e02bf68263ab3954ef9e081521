Nigerian defender, Ola Aina, has said it was “sad” to see the team lose their clean sheet against Sudan. The Super Eagles were three goals up, when Aina gave away a penalty in the second half. Initially, the incident was not picked up by the referee, but it was later awarded following a VAR review. “Yea, we gave away the clean sheet. “It’s sad for the team, the defence, and it’s sad for Madu because he’s been keeping clean sheets,” Aina told the Super Eagles media team. Aina admitted he was at fault, but insisted he was looking at the ball and not the player. “What happened was I was not looking at the player. Obviously, I held his shirt a little bit, but there’s always a little bit of shirt holding in the box, and I was just watching the ball. “I didn’t see when I stepped on his foot,” he added.
