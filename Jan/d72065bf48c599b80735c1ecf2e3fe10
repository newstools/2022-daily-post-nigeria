A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain in Zagon Kataf Local Goverment Area of Kaduna State, Alhaji Muhammed Boroboro, on Sunday condemned the bandits attack and killing of several people in Atak Mawai in Zaman Dabo village, Atyap Chiefdom in Zangon Kataf. The community came under heavy attack in the early hours of Sunday by unknown gunmen, killing about 10 persons and burning about 10 houses. Speaking to DAILY POST on Sunday, Alhaji Borboro, who described the attack as babaric and inhumane expressed regret for the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government, noting that its only achievement is insecurity and killing of human beings without pity. “Since my parents gave birth to me, I have never, never witnessed wastage of human lives and properties. Of what benefits are these killings to the Federal Government and the killers, I don’t understand,” he said. He said many Nigerians are living in abject poverty not because they refused to be hardworking but the fear of bandits have discouraged them. “Today, farmers can no longer go far to farm. Businessmen and women can no longer go to bush market because of the fear of criminals. “As a businessman, you dare not display your business worth because there are kidnappers’ informants who go about to report you to their criminal friends who are ready to pounce on you and collect all your life savings,” he added.
