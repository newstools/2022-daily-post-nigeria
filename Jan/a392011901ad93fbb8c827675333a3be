The leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, has said the anticipated presidential ambition of the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo would cause crisis within the ruling party. Primate Ayodele said Osinbajo’s presidential ambition would cause crisis between him, President Muhammadu Buhari, and Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC. In a statement by his spokesman, Oluwatoyin Osho, the Primate, however, said there is no harm in trying. According to Ayodele, Osinbajo won’t find it easy because there would be opposition. He said: ‘’His ambition will cause crisis between him and President Buhari, Bola Ahmed Tinubu though there is no harm in trying but he won’t find it too easy.’’ Also, Primate Ayodele warned Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, Orji Uzor Kalu and Hamza Al-Mustapha against running for president in 2023. He then advised Wike and Uzor Kalu to fight for the position of Vice President because they won’t be president. ‘’Nyesom Wike, Orji Uzor Kalu cannot be president, let them start fighting for vice president post, Southern agenda is very dicey, a northern president is imminent except God changes it. Hamza Al-Mustapha cannot even win a local government in his state, he should not waste money.’’ He revealed that the southern agenda is very dicey and that a northern president is imminent except the Lord changes it.
