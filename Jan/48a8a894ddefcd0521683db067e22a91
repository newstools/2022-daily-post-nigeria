Amid reported killings of Zamfara bandit leaders during a recent airstrike, Bello Turji, a notorious bandit, has reportedly relocated to a safer and conducive environment. On January 3, 2022, Bello Turji was reported to have released 52 kidnapped victims following his letter to President Muhammadu Buhari, Governor Bello Matawalle, and Emir of Shinkafi for a cease-fire. However, while waiting for a response to his letter, an air raid destroyed the bandits’ camp in multiple operations across the region, killing several bandits while others sustained bullet wounds. A source told DAILY POST that Bello Turji and his men have left their enclave in Fakai forest of Shinkafi Local Government Area of the state to another forest within the Bukkuyum Local Government Area in the south-west of the state. He added that peace is gradually returning to the state since the military raided the bandits’ hideouts, adding that Bello Turji and his men moved to Bukkuyum because there is a lack of security presence in the area, According to him, one of the bandits’ leaders, Shehu Bayade, is the spearhead of deadly raids, kidnappings and cattle rustling in Anka and Bukkuyum communities. He added that Turji’s arrival may be a plan to regroup and reinforce their activities. “We believe Turji and his boys were invited to that forest. This is because in their own thinking, making the vast forest their abode would make their detection by NAF aircraft harder unlike where they had left,” he said.
