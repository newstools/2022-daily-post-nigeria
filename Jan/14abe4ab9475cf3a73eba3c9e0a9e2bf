Former Manchester United defender, Paul Parker has told Jesse Lingard to leave Old Trafford without further delay. Parker said that Lingard, who he described as ‘Mr Instagram’, must ‘stop taking pictures and start being a footballer’. Lingard has made 224 appearances for the Red Devils, helping them win the FA Cup, EFL Cup and Europa League. But the England international has fallen down the pecking order at the Theatre of Dreams, with speculation that he will leave the club in January. Newcastle United are in pole position to sign the 29-year-old from Manchester United and Parker said the player should not hesitate to move on and try to revive his career at St James’ Park. Parker told MyBettingSites, “I think Jesse Lingard needs to go. He’s almost 30. “You can’t just be one of the names at Manchester United and be ‘Mr. Instagram’ around all these big names at a big club. “He’s got to go out and prove that he wants to play football and he doesn’t need Manchester United around him. He needs to stop taking pictures and start becoming a footballer. “If it means going to Newcastle, they can demand even more from him because he comes from Manchester United, good for him. “They’re going to demand more from him because it seems that he wants to be Mr. Social Media and he’s going to have to demand more from himself.”
