Super Eagles frontman, Taiwo Awoniyi, has said that it does not really matter to him whether he scores a goal or not in the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. Awoniyi, who fired blank in Super Eagles 1-0 win over Egypt in their first Group D clash, said what matters to him is a victory for the team. The 24-year-old, who is in top form for his Ferman club side, Union Berlin, made his senior debut against Central African Republic in Lagos. “I stand to be corrected but when it comes to the national team the question of whether you scored or not most media need to stop it because we are here to represent the country, it doesn’t matter who scored,” he told the Super Eagles media team after Wednesday’s training ahead of Saturday’s clash with Sudan. “For me, I am happy with the victory if I score or I don’t score, even till the end of the tournament, if I don’t score, I’m happy as long as we win. “Hopefully, I’ll score, which is my job to do but whether I score or not is not a question I want to answer.”
