The President, Nigerian Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE), Olatunji Ambali, has said there is an urgent need for autonomy for local governments in the country. Speaking at a press conference in Abuja, Ambali suggested that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) should be allowed to conduct local government polls for fair, free and credible elections. According to him, there are a lot of abuses and a lack of transparency in the conduct of the council elections following the creation of state electoral commissions. He alleged that what the commissions do now is a coronation, appointment and promotion of political jobbers and cronies into local government administration, thereby creating an avenue to siphon council resources. Ambali emphasized that NULGE was also clamouring for financial autonomy for the councils in order to ensure transparency in its operations. He explained, “So, council allocations should be directly paid to their account. The lacuna in the 1999 Constitution (as amended) called the joint allocation account is no longer acceptable to Nigerians and NULGE.” The NULGE President noted that it must be scrapped, stressing that it gives room for stealing and diversion of council funds by politicians at the state level. He enjoined state governors to seek God and Nigerians’ forgiveness for allegedly destroying the local government system. He observed that insecurity would not end soon if according to him there is consistent rape of the local government system by cabals and politicians.
