Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) Commandant-General, Ahmed Audi, has ordered the rejig of the Rivers State Command. The CG also on Monday declared war against petroleum pipeline vandals and oil bunkerers in the state. Corps spokesperson, Olusola Odumosu, noted that the management was keen on sanctifying operations. Audi had removed Head of the Anti-Vandal Unit, State Commandant and Zonal Commander. The CG disbanded the unit after Governor Nyesom Wike accused the NSCDC of aiding bunkering. A video showing personnel allegedly guarding illegal activities trended. Wike’s Chief Security Officer (CSO) stormed the location with a police contingent and disarmed the NSCDC team leader. Audi directed the new unit to fight all economic saboteurs, arrest oil thieves and dismantle all illegal refineries. “Any attempt to delay immediate prosecution of arrested suspects is tantamount to compromise. “Any personnel caught collecting settlement or tampering with impounded tankers, petroleum products and other exhibits would be sanctioned and dealt with decisively. “This will be according to the Standard Operating Procedures and Code of Ethics of the Corps”, he said.
