Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, is ready to sell three players he considers as troublemakers within his squad, BILD reports. There are 10 days left before the transfer window closes and Ragnick is expected to trim the squad he inherited from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. The German is looking to get rid of Paul Pogba, Anthony Martial and Cavani. He feels the trio have too much influence in the dressing room and are “killing the mood” in the camp. Cavani has barely played this season and is keen to find regular first-team football instead of seeing out his contract which expires in June. Pogba is in the same situation as Cavani, but United are still hopeful he will extend his stay in Manchester with a contract offer still on the table. But he could be sold, so he doesn’t leave for free at the end of the season. Martial has already expressed his desire to leave United and the feeling is mutual after Rangnick called the Frenchman out for refusing to play against Aston Villa.
