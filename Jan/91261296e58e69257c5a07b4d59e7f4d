Niger State Governor, Abubakar Sani Bello, has narrated some of the harrowing experiences citizens of his state have been going through in the hands of terrorists, classified as bandits and kidnappers. Bello, who stormed the Presidential Villa Abuja, on Tuesday, to brief President Muhammadu Buhari on prevailing security situation in his state, said, in January this year alone, the state has suffered not less than 50 reported attacks and losses of lives. According to the Governor, between 1st and 17th January, not less than 300 communities have been invaded by bandits. He placed the number of people kidnapped at 200, including three Chinese nationals, adding that about 25 security personnel also died within the short period. “Unfortunately, we lost about 165 civilians and 30 local vigilantes. So, it’s a very dire situation that we have been battling in the last few weeks since the beginning of this year,”he told State House reporters. He said the land mass of the state which is about nine million hectares also places a lot of disadvantages, especially in terms of manning the borders effectively. “We share borders with Kaduna, Zamfara, and Kebbi States. And these bandits have the habit of hibernating between forests, moving from Zamfara to Kebbi, and Kebbi to Niger. They take advantage of the cattle routes which they already know. “They move on motorcycles, most of the areas and communities they attack have no access roads. So, you cannot drive there. So, our response time is slow. But going forward, there will be new strategies which I earlier mentioned. It will help us. But I can’t disclose some of those strategies,”he told reporters at the State House. DAILY POST recalls that President Buhari recently ordered the military to apply force in rooting out terrorism from the state, since it has been eatablished that remnants of Boko Haram were infiltrating the state in a bid to escape onslaught from the Nigerian armed forces.
