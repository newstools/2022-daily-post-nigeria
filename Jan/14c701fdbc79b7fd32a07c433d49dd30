Eighteen political parties have indicated interest to participate in the February 5, 2022, local government election in Kebbi State. Alhaji Mustapha Usman Ka’oje, the Commissioner for Publicity and Voter Education, Kebbi State Independent Electoral Commission (KESIEC) made the disclosure in Brinin Kebbi, the State capital on Thursday. He expressed optimism that the election would be conducted free, fair and credible. Alhaji Ka’oje explained that, “18 political parties have indicated interest to participate in the forthcoming local government council poll as they have all fielded candidates. Though, some of the political parties were not able to field candidates for all the positions.” As a commission, he stated that they cannot begin to entertain factions, stressing that if they do that, it was capable of truncating the electoral processes. He explained that they have only one APC in the State.
