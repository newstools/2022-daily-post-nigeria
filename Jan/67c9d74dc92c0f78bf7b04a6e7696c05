A Jos Central Area Court sitting in Kasuwan Nama in Plateau State, on Thursday, dissolved a three-year-old marriage between Adaka Yunana and his wife, Helen, after she eloped with her lover. A panel of judges, Ghazali Adam and Hyacinth Dolnanan, in granting the request made by Yunana, said all efforts to reconcile both parties had failed. The judges, however, ordered Yunana and Helen to go their separate way, NAN reports. Earlier, Yunana pleaded with the court to dissolve his union with Helen. He said: ”My wife eloped in 2019, the same year I married her to be with her lover. ”She didn’t call to say why she abandoned her home.” Two traders sent to prison for stealing phone
