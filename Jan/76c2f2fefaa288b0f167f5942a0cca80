President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick, has revealed Super Eagles’ dream for President Muhammadu Buhari amid the ongoing 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cameroon. Pinnick said the Super Eagles’ dream is to win the 2021 AFCON and hand it over to President Buhari. The NFF boss said this on Sunday during a video conference with Buhari, Minister of Sports and Youth Development, Sunday Dare, Super Eagles coach, Augustine Eguavoen, Super Eagles players, and among others ahead of Nigeria’s 2021 AFCON last-16 tie with Tunisia. “Mr President, we want to thank you for all your support, prayers and everything you have done not just for the sport but for the young football,” Pinnick said. “We also want to seize this opportunity to thank our honorable minister [Sunday Dare] who has been doing a yeoman’s job. A lot of work underground in ensuring that we achieve the success we have achieved today and to the team they have been marvelous. “They have been a true representation of our country. The Naija spirit has always been with them and will always be with them and by God’s grace. Like I told them, it wouldn’t be enough. We won under 17 under the president twice. “We want to win the AFCON and hand it over to the president. That is the dream of this team,” he said. Meanwhile, Nigeria is the only team at the 2021 AFCON to win all their three matches [against Egypt, Sudan and Guinea-Bissau] at the group stage.
