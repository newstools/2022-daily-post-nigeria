The Senator representing Kano Central, Ibrahim Shekarau, has vowed to personally investigate the death of a 5-year-old pupil, Hanifa Abubakar, in Kano State. Recall that the body of Hanifa was found in a shallow grave at Noble Kids School after she was kidnapped in December 2021. Abdulmalik Tanko, proprietor of the school, who was arrested with his accomplice, confessed to killing her after kidnapping the pupil in December. He gave the minor rat poison after demanding a ransom of N6m from the family in which N100,000 was raised for the abductor. Shekarau in a statement by his media aide, Sule Yau Sule, sympathized with the deceased family. The former Kano State Governor assured the family that he will ensure the deceased gets justice. Shekarau said, “A heartless murder like this must not be swept under the carpet. “We will follow the case to its logical conclusion.” The former governor prayed Almighty Allah to grant the family the fortitude to bear the loss.
