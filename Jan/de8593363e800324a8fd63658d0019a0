President Muhammadu Buhari’s Personal Assistant on New Media, Bashir Ahmad, has reacted to Super Eagles defeat to Tunisia in the Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, in Cameroon. Ahmad said the Super Eagles of Nigeria will avenge their AFCON defeat on Ghana during the World Cup playoffs. The Super Eagles on Sunday crashed out of the tournament in Cameroon after a 0-1 loss to the Carthage Eagles of Tunisia. A goalkeeping error from Maduka Okoye gave the North African side the goal a few minutes into the second half. Reacting, Ahmad said Ghana would pay for the Super Eagles loss. In a tweet, the presidential aide noted that Nigeria can’t afford to miss the World Cup in Qatar later in the year. “A severe revenge will surely be taken on Ghana in the upcoming World Cup playoffs. We can’t afford to not be in Qatar,” he tweeted.
