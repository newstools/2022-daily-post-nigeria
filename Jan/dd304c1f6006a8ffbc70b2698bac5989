Indigenes of Southern Senatorial District in Cross River State have cautioned Senator Sandy Onor against being greedy and overreaching. Their warning follows Onor’s public declaration of interest to succeed Ayade against their preferred interest, Gershom Bassey. They claim that Onor, who represents the Central Senatorial District is aware that it is now the turn of the Southern Senatorial District to produce the governor in 2023, yet he is damning all consequences to dare them. Ete Effiwat Akamba, a community leader in Akpabuyo LGA speaking on behalf of the district said, “What Prof Sandy Onor is doing amounts to sheer greediness. He has only spent two years in the Senate. He is not satisfied. He wants to jump at the governorship which is not even zoned to his district”. He insisted the district will ensure that Onor and anyone else from another district coming to challenge the position never succeeds, saying they have waited for 16 years for their turn to come. But reacting on Sunday, Senator Onor insisted that PDP has not zoned the 2023 governorship to the southern senatorial district. He said it is neither constitutional to do so nor is rotation a binding exercise in the state. He recalled that the tenures of three governors since the advent of Democracy in 1999 have never been on zoning, maintaining that from Donald Duke through Liyel Imoke and to the incumbent, Ben Ayade victorious candidates usually competed against the others. He even challenged those that are bandying the Calabar-Ogoja Accord of the1970s and 80s to prove that it was formed to champion zoning arrangements in the state. “There is nowhere in the party’s constitution that zoning is sacrosanct. So PDP in the state can not enforce that. The best and courageous ones are usually allowed to aspire and the marketable ones are picked to represent the party at the election. Zoning amounts to cowardice, and this is usually given verve to by jingoists.”
