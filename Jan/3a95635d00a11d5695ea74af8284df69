Arsenal has reportedly agreed on a deal in principle to sign New England Revolution goalkeeper, Matt Turner. The Evening Standard reports that Turner is now set to arrive at Emirates in the summer of 2022. New England Revolution will receive around £5 million-plus add-ons for Turner. The Major League Soccer club will also receive a ten percent sell-on percentage of any future transfer fee for the 27-year-old shot-stopper. Meanwhile, Everton has their eye on an ambitious move for Chelsea midfielder, Ruben Loftus-Cheek. According to Daily Mail, Everton’s interest will be knocked back with Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, not prepared to let the England international leave. Meanwhile, Juventus also had their eyes on Loftus-Cheek earlier in the January transfer window as they drew up possible replacements for Arthur Melo, who now looks set to stay in Turin.
