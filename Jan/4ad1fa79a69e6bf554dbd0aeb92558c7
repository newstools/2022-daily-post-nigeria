Manchester United forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, has said he clashed with some players at the club because they cannot take criticism. There have been stories of in-fighting in the dressing room since Ralf Rangnick became interim manager. Ronaldo has now said one of the biggest problems he, Rangnick and the other experienced players in the dressing room are facing, is that the younger players refuse to take their advice. During his first spell at Old Trafford, the 36-year-old explained that he was open to advise from the more experienced heads in the dressing room. “The mature players, the older players, can always help the younger players,” Ronaldo told Sky Sports. “But I can give you an example if I give you advice, even if you are younger than me, but if that’s not in your plan during your daily life then it will be difficult. You can speak all day with that person, but if it’s not coming from inside of you then it is impossible. “I can remember when I was 18, 19, 20, some older players spoke to me but I put that as ‘Cristiano, you have to improve, they know more than you, they are more experienced than you, they passed through many bad moments’. “But the other people do not accept when you criticise them – I don’t say this in relation to our players but in general, I have kids, I know. Sometimes if you become a little bit harder they do the opposite. You have to find the right balance to speak with them. “But in my opinion, the main point is, it should come from inside you. You should be proud of yourself and look in the mirror and say ‘Listen, I gave everything and I think all of us should do that because new year, we change the page and we have many things to win. “We have to believe in that, if not, it will be a nightmare.”
