Founder of Daar Communications, Raymond Dokpesi, has disclosed what he would do if former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, fails to hand over to someone from the southeast if he becomes president. Dokpesi vowed to strip naked and embark on a one-man march if Atiku fails to relinquish power to the southeast after four years. The Chairman of the Technical Committee for the Abubakar Atiku Presidential Project urged the people of the southeast to support the former Vice President’s ambition to rule Nigeria in 2023. He spoke while addressing journalists on Monday, after a meeting with leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Abia State. According to Dokpesi: ”We are in a grave situation in Nigeria. We need to unite. We need to take power from these impostors that have ceased power and ran Nigeria aground. ”If I’m alive till then I will go naked in a one-man march if southeast is not given the presidency. I will put my life on the line. I will never be silent. ”It’s a matter of timing. Those clamouring for a southern presidency now are APC governors and they are doing so for selfish reasons. Buhari has never respected the equity provision in our constitution.”
