King Kosoko Royal Family and Oloja of Lagos say they have no hands in the Lagos Island unrest that erupted on January 19. Last week, two days of bloody clashes disrupted activities in Idumota, Kosoko, Oluwole, Martins and Balogun areas. Some of the rioters, innocent commuters and traders were injured. A number of persons also lost their goods, phones and other personal belongings. A statement by Alhaja Mutiot Ashabi Alli-Balogun (King Kosoko Royal Family) and Prince Abiola Olojo-kosoko, Head of Family (Oloja of Lagos-elect) condemned the violence. The families unequivocally stressed that they played no part in the “Idumota Vs Kosoko” face-off. They said King Kosoko Royal Family is not an organisation but a reputable royal/chieftaincy family in Lagos State and three other West Africa countries. “We do not have anything to do with the 19th of January 2022 Lagos Island unrest orchestrated by some street gangs for selfish reasons, which we believe the Nigeria Police are still investigating.” The statement appealed to the public to ignore the claim that the Kosokos participated in the incidence in any way.
