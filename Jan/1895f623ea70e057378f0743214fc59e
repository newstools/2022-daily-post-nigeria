Arsenal midfielder, Thomas Partey, has apologized for showing a ‘lack of intelligence’ during his side’s Carabao Cup semi-final second leg 2-0 defeat to Liverpool on Thursday. Partey was introduced from the bench against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg despite only flying in from the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) after his country Ghana was eliminated from the tournament. The former Atletico Madrid star picked up two yellow cards in the space of three minutes and was sent off during the encounter. The Carabao Cup tie was finely balanced after the first-leg ended 0-0 at Anfield last week but Diogo Jota’s brace ensured Liverpool eliminated Arsenal from the Carabao Cup semi-final and will now face Chelsea in the final in February. Apologizing via a message on Instagram, Partey wrote: “I am responsible for anything that happened and will take all the critics. “I should be more intelligent not to get in a challenge already booked but this is my personality. I like to fight for every ball. “I love this club and I love my country even though things sometimes don’t happen how I wanted. I would continue to work harder and make things right. “I came back with the mentality to make myself available for the team to get to the final but it did not happen as planned. “I will continue to give my all when I am on the field of play because this is my life and this is what I chose to do. “I am not happy with all that has happened yesterday and at the AFCON but I understand only with hard work things will change so I will continue to work hard to change this. Thanks.”
