Yoruba Ronu Group (YRG) has described All Progressives Congress (APC) leader, Bola Tinubu, as God’s gift to Nigeria and mankind. The socio-political organization declared that Tinubu remains the best presidential aspirant for 2023. “Tinubu is a product of God’s magnanimity to mankind in this generation”, Diran Iyantan, YRG President, said on Sunday in Akure, the Ondo State capital. At a meeting of the group, he said their intention was to endorse a hopeful that would perform well in office. He noted that Tinubu remained an administrator of immense proportion, who, as Lagos Governor, held sway and achieved “eight unforgettable years”. “It is with Asiwaju’s immense successful track record and his values as a promoter of men that we have decided to endorse his presidential ambition. “This includes that we shall marshal our numerous supporters and followers to mobilise for his success at the poll. “He will build on the existing infrastructure and the legacies of our revered President Muhammadu Buhari. “He will improve the security status of the country. He would make the economy thrive and bring back the unity of the country lost at the point of the civil war”, NAN quoted him as saying. Iyantan added that the people are full of hope for the future because of what will be attainable due to Tinubu’s concern for a greater Nigeria. Tinubu met President Buhari on January 4 to formally inform him of his intention to succeed him on May 29, 2023.
