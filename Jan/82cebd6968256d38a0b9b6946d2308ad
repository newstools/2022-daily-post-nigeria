President Muhammadu Buhari has accused state governors of having poor relationships with the local governments, stating that the third tier of government is not getting their constitutional entitlements from the governors. In an exclusive interview with Channels Television to be aired at 7 pm on Wednesday, the president alleged that there is always a battle between the governors and local governments. President Buhari also said that the establishment of state police is not an option for the country holding that the governors would abuse their power. He said, “State police is not an option… Find out the relationship between local government and the governors. Are the third tier of government getting what they are supposed to get constitutionally? Are they getting it? “Let the people in local government tell you the truth, the fight between local governments and the governor.” On the current security situation in the country, President Buhari advocated for more dialogue in solving the farmer-herder clashes causing havoc in many parts of the nation. “The role of traditional rulers must not be undermined, because in their areas they know who is who, even by families, not to even talk of individuals,” he said.
