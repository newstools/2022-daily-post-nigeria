The Technical Director of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Augustine Eguavoen, has said the incoming head coach of the Super Eagles will be given all the support he needs to deliver. Portuguese tactician, Jose Peseiro, was named as the next permanent handler of the three-time African champions before the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. Eguaveon led the team to three straight victories at the AFCON group stage, before they were eliminated by Tunisia in the round of 16. He has since left the role and Paseiro is expected to take over. Nigeria’s next matches are the 2022 FIFA World Cup playoffs against Ghana in March. “We have to sit down together and map out strategies. We need to give him the platform, we have already prepared the team for 80 to 90 percent. “He just has to add his own style and leadership. We would support him with everything because the country comes first,” Eguavoen said before the team left Cameroon.
