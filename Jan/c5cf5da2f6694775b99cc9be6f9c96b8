Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has described the state chapter of the People’s Democratic Party, PDP, as an unserious political group dishing out lies in the state. While lashing out at the party over the allegation that the governor’s immediate family was involved in siphoning funds in the state, Akeredolu disclosed that PDP’s style could be termed as juvenile opposition. PDP had in a statement issued on Sunday by its Publicity Secretary, Kennedy Peretei alleged that the governor would soon be evicted from the government house by the people over looting by his immediate family. The governor who spoke through his Commissioner for Information, Donald Ojogo, challenged the PDP to name the 13 companies it alleged that Akeredolu’s family used to siphon funds as well the directors of the companies. Ojogo who also dismissed the allegation of the collection of N500m by his ministry for the Ondo countdown challenged the PDP to petition the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC if the party is sure of its claim. “Their assertions in respect of 13 companies they claimed were registered by the Governor’s family in 2017 without evidence exposes the juvenile and pedestrian composure of the PDP. “It is a sheer waste of precious media space to assert without evidence to prove. We challenge the PDP to publish the names of the Directors of those companies as well as the names of those companies.”
