A lecturer in the Department of Political Science, Ahmadu Bello University Zaria, Jonathan Alibaba, on Sunday in Kaduna, condemned the massacre of over 200 innocent souls by migrating bandits in Zamfara State, saying there is no peace for the wicked. Alibaba, while speaking with DAILYPOST on Sunday in Kaduna, bared his mind on rampant cases of killings, kidnapping and other forms of criminals across the country. He said those who kill out of sheer wickedness will know no peace, as the spirit of those killed will continue to hunt them, even after death. DAILY POST recalls that migrating bandits who were loyal to terror kingpin, Bello Turji, had attacked Shinkafi Local Government Area of Zamfara State after they were displaced by fighter jets of the Nigerian Air Force from their enclaves in Fakai forest.
They killed over 200 people, burnt houses and property of their victims. Alibaba, while reacting to the killing on Sunday, in Kaduna, maintained that the bandits, their sponsors and all those who are distabilizing the peace of this country, live a life of perpetrated fears, as they will not be useful to themselves.
“If bandits live a peaceful life, they wouldn’t have moved from one forest to another. They are always aggressive, worried and could not settle at all because death may meet them at anytime,” he said
He said apart from bandits, those who supply them guns and ammunition have no stable minds, adding that, “their sponsors can be exposed at any time once they are caught.”
