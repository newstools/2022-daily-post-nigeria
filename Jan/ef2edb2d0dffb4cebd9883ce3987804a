The Rasaq Salinsile faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State has demanded that Governor Adegboyega Oyetola should resign from the National Caretaker and Extraordinary National Convention Planning Committee since he has declared his intention to contest for a second term as the State Governor. The faction also demanded the validation of the ward, local and State congresses it conducted in the State and that the party executives so elected be returned as valid. The faction tabled these demands during a closed-door meeting with the members of the Senator Abdullahi Adamu-led APC National Reconciliation Committee which met with aggrieved members of both sides of the party in Osogbo on Saturday. Salinsile, who expressed optimism that the Abdullahi Adamu committee would do justice to their demands and will not compromise, added that the reason the group was calling for the resignation of Governor Oyetola was because he cannot be a judge in his own case since he is a member of the National Secretariat which will conduct the party primaries in the State. Speaking with journalists, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, the Chairman of the APC National Reconciliation Committee, expressed optimism that the crisis in the party would be resolved amicably. Adamu, who noted that the party members were honest and straightforward with their submissions, added that their complaints would be considered in the report of the committee when it returns to the National Secretariat. In his words, “We are very encouraged with the presentations of the party members. The people have been straightforward, they have been very honest in their various submissions and we have taken note of the comments, contributions and the interventions they made.” “We are a committee, we were sent by the party. We will take all of these things. Where we have reasons that are tangible in the petitions, we listen to the petitioners, then we make our report to the people that appointed us,” he added.
