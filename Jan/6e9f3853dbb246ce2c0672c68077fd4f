Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) and Ikeja Electric (IE) Plc have given reason for the outage currently being experienced by customers under their networks. The DisCos in statements issued on their social media pages on Saturday attributed the outage to a drop in power generation. EKEDC said the reduction in supply was due to the drop in power generation from an average of 3,700MW to 2,000MW per hour. The DisCo noted that this was as a result of gas limitations arising from vandalism, and more recently an issue affecting the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) line from the Egbin Power Plant. The statement read: “We apologize to customers for the inconvenience this has caused and assure you that we’re working with our generation and transmission partners to ensure that stable supply is achieved within the shortest possible time. “We equally commenced major network rehabilitation and relief projects within our network two weeks ago that will significantly improve our services to our dear customers.” Similarly, Ikeja Electric said the power outage is being experienced in certain areas of its network due to load shedding by TCN as a result of a drop in power generation. The DisCo disclosed that the affected areas are Iju, Abule Odu, Egbeda, Oregun, Anifowoshe, Ago, Okota, Oke Afa, Ajao, Amuwo, Ikosi, Mende, Ogudu, Bariga, Oworo, Gbagada and Ilupeju. Ikeja Electric in its short message said: “We regret the inconvenience and wish to assure that our technical team is working with other partners in the electricity value chain to improve the situation in the areas.” Ikeja electric assured that normalcy will be restored to affected areas as soon as stability is achieved.
