Katsina State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) says it will participate in the forthcoming local government elections, scheduled for March in Katsina State. According to Yusuf Salisu-Majigiri, the PDP has credible and better candidates for both the chairmanship and councillorship positions any time the electoral umpire is ready to conduct the council poll. “PDP is a formidable national party. So, there is no election that is guided by the law that PDP will not participate in. Certainly, we will participate,” he said. Majigiri made the disclosure while receiving Sirajo Aminu, an aspirant for Katsina Central Senatorial District at the party’s secretariat on Sunday. Aminu was at the party’s secretariat to formally make his intention to contest for the Katsina central senatorial seat known to the ward, local and State executives of the party. Speaking at the occasion, Aminu said that he decided to throw his heart into the ring in answer to the call to serve the people in the senatorial district. The turnout by the party’s loyalists to cheer the aspirant was a sign of unity and eventual victory for the party, the party chairman said. He urged members to be more united and formidable in order to win both the local government and the 2023 general elections
