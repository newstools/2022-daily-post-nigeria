Adams Oshiomhole, former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has reacted to tweets disparaging Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State. Oshiomhole denied calling Makinde ‘an over hyped social media governor’. The tweets ascribed to Oshiomhole denigrated the governor amongst other issues. However, the former, in a statement signed by his media aide, Victor Oshioke on Sunday, distanced himself from the handle. The APC National Chairman described the Twitter handle as fake. According to the former Comrade governor, the handle is not operated by him or any of his aides. The statement reads: “The attention of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole has been drawn to a series of tweets from a twitter account @A_Oshiomhole commenting on recent national issues. Specifically, there was a tweet that originated from this account on January 20, 2022 which seem to insinuate that H. E. Seyi Makinde, Executive Governor of Oyo State is an “Overhyped Social Media Governor.” “We wish to alert the general public that this twitter account is fake as it is not operated by Comrade Adams Oshiomhole or any of his aides.” The APC chieftain stressed that he holds Makinde in high esteem; hence has no reason to disparage him privately or publicly. “Let it be on record that all tweets that have originated from this account or will originate from it in the future do not represent the opinions or sentiments of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole.” Oshiomhole also disassociated himself from some Twitter handles carrying his names and photographs. “Some of them are: @adamsoshiomhole, @Oshiomhole, @adamsosh, @_adamsoshiomole, @adamsOshiomhol, @Adamsoshiomol4, @Adamsoshiomol5” Disclosing his handle, the former APC National Chairman said his “official handle which will be verified soon is @aoshiomhole.”
