Another section of the Katsina State House of Assembly on Sunday was gutted by fire again, destroying not fewer than four offices and some equipment. The incident, which was said to have occurred between 6.30 p.m to 9.30 pm on Sunday, a source said “may have been triggered by high-power voltage from one of the offices and destroyed electrical appliances, furniture and some documents.” Recall that some eight months ago, a similar incident occurred inside the upper legislative chambers, destroying furniture, electrical fittings and appliances among others.
The assembly complex is still undergoing renovation as a result of the former incident. The Speaker of the Assembly, Hon. Tasi’u Maigari, while confirming the incident to newsmen on Tuesday said “a committee chaired by the House Leader, Abubakar Suleiman Abukur, has been set up to unravel what led to the inferno.” According to Maigari, “the fire affected the office of the Clerk of the Assembly, that of his deputy, as well as the legislative common room but that men of the fire service were able to quickly intervene and prevent it from spreading further.”
