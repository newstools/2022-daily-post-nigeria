Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, has pleaded with Edinson Cavani not to leave the club this month. The 34-year-old striker has been linked with Barcelona and a few South American clubs. But Rangnick is ‘desperate’ for Cavani to remain at Old Trafford. “We had quite a few conversations in the last couple of weeks, probably the player with whom I have spoken most,” Rangnick said. “I told him from the very first day that, for me, he is a highly important player. “And, as I said, his professionalism, his work ethic is just amazing and I told him that I desperately want him to stay until the end of the season. He knows that. He also knows how highly I rate him and how highly I respect him. We spoke and he knows that I will definitely not let him go. “For me, he is a highly important player for the rest of the season, still playing in three competitions, so we will definitely need Edi. I would rather have another Edi on top of that but for me, it’s clear that Edi has to stay.”
