Former Tottenham star, Jermain Defoe, has recalled his encounter with ex-England boss, Fabio Capello. Defoe admitted the ‘no-nonsense’ Italian boss once scared him, telling him to ‘get out and go to dinner.’ Defoe was telling talkSPORT all about what it was like playing alongside some of the biggest names in football. “Anyway, so I can’t remember who we were playing against, but the team was at the Grove Hotel. I remember sitting in the room, we had a meeting at 7pm, dinner’s at 8pm,” Defoe told talkSPORT. “But he ended up calling the meeting at 6:45pm and I didn’t know. So I’ve come down – this is Fabio Capello, everyone’s scared of him anyway – so I’m walking down, I’m outside the meeting room and everyone’s coming out. “I thought ‘No’. My heart’s started beating. It was like I was at school, everyone’s walking out and I was flustered, I was confused. So I walked in and I was like ‘Boss, I’m sorry.’… “‘Sorry?’, he said, ‘What time do you think this is? It’s unacceptable. When you go for dinner with your family do you make them wait?’. “I said ‘No boss’, he said ‘Get out and go to dinner’. I walked out like a little kid and I never let it happen again… “The boys were laughing, and Ashley Young said to me ‘JD, I was late as well, I came in just before you’.”
