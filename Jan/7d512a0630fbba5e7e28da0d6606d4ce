The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), has mourned the departure of Olubadan Saliu Adetunji. ACF observed that if he had lived on, Nigerians would have benefitted much more from his wisdom and stability of character. Chief Audu Ogbeh, National Chairman of AFC, in a statement noted that, “We mourn his departure because Nigeria has a lot to learn from him. If he had lived on, we would have benefitted much more from his wisdom and stability of character.” The ACF said it considered the late Olubadan as a very progressive traditional ruler who brought progress and stability to Ibadan, the headquarters of the defunct Western Region and a very powerful stool in Yoruba land. The statement observed that Ibadan is a traditional Yoruba town which has grown to accommodate the diverse ethnic groups in Nigeria. It added that it has a pan Nigeria spirit fostered and nurtured by good men such as Olubadan Adetunji. The ACF joined other Nigerians in mourning his death, and sympathised with his immediate family, the Ibadan Traditional Rulers’ Councils and the Oyo Traditional Council. “We pray that God will give them the wisdom to choose a worthy successor to the departed Olubadan,” the forum noted.
