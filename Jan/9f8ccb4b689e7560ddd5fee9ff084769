Football Fans Club of Nigeria, FFCN, has spoken for the first time since the Super Eagles were eliminated from the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations by Tunisia. Speaking through its President, Ambassador Kemi Ogunfuwa, the club responsible for singing and cheering national teams of Nigeria, said its members felt let down by the outcome of the round of 16 clash and left the Stadium in tears. A second half striker by Youssef Msakni was all the North Africans needed to send the Super Eagles packing from the tournament they were tipped to win. The Super Eagles had lifted the expectations of many fans, having beaten Egypt, Sudan and Guinea Bissau comfortably in the group stage to enter the round of 16. “We were so disappointed because it wasn’t something we were expecting,” Ogunfuwa stated, according to Complete Sports. “We won all our group matches and all that we were hoping for was to get to the final but it’s disheartening we had to go home early at this stage. “The fact that one of them [Alex Iwobi] got a red card was a minus to us. We gave them all the full support they needed. Even when the Tunisians scored first, we were still cheering and clapping for them. “We as members of the supporters club felt let down and we left the stadium in tears. “My eyes are still swollen and I have found it difficult to sleep since then.” Next up for the Super Eagles of Nigeria is their World Cup qualifying playoff match against the Black Stars of Ghana. Most of Super Eagles players have apologised and taken the blame for the disappointing outing in Cameroon, promising to do better starting with their playoff game against Ghana in March.
