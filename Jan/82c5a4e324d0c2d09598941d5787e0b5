The United States government has reiterated its commitment to support anti-corruption initiatives in Nigeria. The US says it remains open to collaborative efforts that can prevent graft, strengthen investigation and prosecution of corruption, promote accountability and transparency and empower reformers. At the weekend, the Consulate and Inter-Religious Coalition Against Corruption in Nigeria launched ReportMagoMago, a web-based portal that leverages citizen engagement. The coalition led by Bishop Emmanuel Gospel Isong and Imam Shefiu Abdulkareem Majemu was formed in 2016. The goal of the body of Christian and Muslim leaders is to ensure that faith communities take a leading role in anti-corruption advocacy. Speaking in Lagos, US Consul General, Claire Pierangelo said the website puts the power to report corruption in the hands of the people. The official urged citizens to use the online platform to address the daily instances of sleaze faced by millions. “Countering corruption is not only a key concern in Nigeria but also a core U.S. national security priority for the Biden Administration”, she said. Pierangelo added that growth, consistent with the richness and strength of Nigeria, depends on a new narrative and a culture where corruption has no place. The CG expressed optimism that the initiative will encourage Nigerians to share their experiences and spark a new movement in fighting the scourge that has hampered development.
