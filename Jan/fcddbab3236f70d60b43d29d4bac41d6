The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has nabbed Michael Jackson for alleged involvement in internet fraud. The suspect was arrested following intelligence on the “illegal activities” of some individuals involved in computer-related fraud. EFCC said Jackson posed as Ella, a transgender woman, and allegedly swindled victims of millions of Naira. He claimed to be a Disc Jockey (DJ) and was in possession of fetish items “for grace and success.” One Toyota 4-runner, one Honda Accord, laptop computers and a mobile device were recovered from him. EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren noted that Jackson will be arraigned after an investigation is concluded.
