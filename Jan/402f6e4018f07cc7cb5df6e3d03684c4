Former Tottenham Hotspur striker, Darren Bent, has said that Manchester United players are scared to wear the club’s jersey. This is following Manchester United’s 1-0 defeat to Wolves on Monday night and previous lacklustre performances by the players. Joao Moutinho scored the only goal of the match for Wolves in the 82nd-minute to end Ralf Rangnick’s unbeaten run in the Premier League. The defeat was also Wolves’ first victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford since 1980 and it put United four points behind fourth-placed Arsenal In the Premier League table. “When you played Manchester United when they were really successful, you used to stand in the tunnel and every single one of their players used to stand there with their chest out and they wanted to carry the burden of that shirt and wear it with pride,” the former Premier League star said. “It’s almost like this Manchester United team are scared to wear the shirt. Even when they get taken off for substitutions, they can’t get off the pitch quick enough. “Even Marcus Rashford at the minute seems to have the world on his shoulders. He’s thinking about other thing else other than football. “I’m not quite sure what direction they are going in.”
