Unknown gunmen have killed another commercial motorcyclist in Akinyele Local Government Area of Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, DAILY POST reliably gathered. The incident occurred in the early hours of Sunday at Labi junction, Express area, along the Oyo-Ibadan expressway. It was gathered that the gunmen shot the commercial motorcyclist and took away his motorcycle. A source told DAILY POST that snatching of motorcycles has become a rampant thing in the area. He called on security agencies to beef up security in the area. He said, “a man was killed this morning at Express road. “We are calling on the Inspector General of Police and the Commissioner of Police in Oyo State to please intervene.” All efforts made by DAILY POST to get a reaction from the Public Relations Officer of the State Police Command, Adewale Osifeso proved abortive. Calls put through his mobile phone were not answered. A message sent to Osifeso asking for his reaction has not been answered as of the time of filing this report on Sunday. Our correspondent recalls that Akinyele Local Government Area witnessed series of killings and kidnapping of innocent citizens in 2020.
