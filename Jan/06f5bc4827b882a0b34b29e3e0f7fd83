The Office of the Wife of the Governor of Abia State has said that some scammers are using social media handles with the image of Dr Mrs Nkechi Ikpeazu to defraud unsuspecting individuals. In a statement by Chika Ojiegbe, the Chief Press Secretary to the Wife of Abia Governor and issued to newsmen in Umuahia, the Abia state capital on Monday, the office found that the operators of the dubious accounts are offering preposterous employment favours and social welfare assistance to their targets with the intent of duping them of huge sums of money in most of the attempts. The office also uncovered that some of the dubious offers include bitcoin transactions and job placements at customs, immigration, the state civil service and others. It further disclosed that security agencies have been alerted about the development. It warned members of public to be wary of mouthwatering offers on social media.
