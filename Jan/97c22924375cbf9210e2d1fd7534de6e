Senate President, Ahmed Lawan said subsidy on Petroleum Motor Spirit (PMS) will not be removed for now. Lawan spoke at the State House on Tuesday after a closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari. The lawmaker said the Nigerian leader has not ordered anybody to remove petrol subsidy as being speculated. He confirmed that many citizens were concerned that the federal government would soon stop the financing. Lawan said legislators met with their constituents on the matter and his visit to Buhari was to inform him of the outcome. “I am happy to inform Nigerians that Mr President never told anyone that the petroleum subsidy should be removed. I agree that the subsidy is very heavy. “We must never transfer the burden to the citizens. We need to look at the quoted figure of 100 million litres that people claim we’re consuming. Is it real?” he asked. Lawan said the figure may be inaccurate, suggesting that there may be sabotage going on. “How on earth are we consuming that? We need to look at this critically and see how we can find the truth,” he said. Lawan further dismissed calls by some governors for the immediate removal of fuel subsidy. “That’s their opinion. And they had their time. They should have done something about it”, he added.
