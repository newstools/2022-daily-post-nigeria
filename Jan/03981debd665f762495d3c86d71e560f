The Nigerian Army does not discriminate between male and female soldiers in internal security operations, Maj.-Gen. Olufemi Oluyede has said. The General Officer Commanding (GOC) 6 Division, Port Harcourt, spoke on Thursday at a sensitisation workshop for troops. Oluyede, represented by Brig.-Gen. Edore Agbebaku, the Signal Commander, said the Army ensures balance of duties among all personnel. The GOC explained that both genders are assigned different responsibilities for the attainment of set objectives. “The army has identified working with various peers as key for success in our internal security operations, in conjunction with sister security agencies,” he said. Oluyede said the military’s development of gender policy was in line with the government’s policy of promoting mainstreaming and women empowerment. The General expressed confidence that the adoption will help the military to compete with counterparts across the globe. “It will also facilitate strategic collaboration and gender sensitive approach by the various security services, given the multidimensional conflicts and security challenges”, he added.
