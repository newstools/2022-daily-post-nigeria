Chieftains of the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) on Wednesday met in Kaduna to deliberate on how to collaborate with Afenifere, a Yoruba socio-political group; and Ohanaeze Ndigbo, an Igbo group, on peaceful coexistence among the various ethnic groups in the country ahead of the 2023 general election. The ACF at the meeting warned its members to stay away from speaking on or endorsing any candidate for the 2023 presidential election in any part of the country. Chief Audu Ogbeh, the ACF Chairman, explained at the National Executive Council (NEC) meeting that their answer to questions is that the group is not a political party to endorse any candidate. According to the former minister, the forum needs to hold meetings with its counterparts in the southwest, south-south and southeast with a view to dousing political tension in the country. He further explained that such meetings would create peaceful coexistence among the various ethnic groups in the country towards ensuring a peaceful forthcoming general election in the country. Ogbeh stated that their plan to have meetings with the various groups is still on course, adding that there is a need to put a stop to abusive words against one region or the other. He noted, “We should desist from endorsing any candidate for the 2023 presidency. If anybody asks you about endorsement, tell such person that we are not a political party.” Ogbeh prayed to God to help Nigerians and give the country a good candidate, stressing that it is only the Almighty God that can solve the country’s problems. He condemned the incessant kidnapping and killing of students and pupils of both private and public schools across the country, calling on governments at all levels to bring sanity to the system, as the country is going nowhere because of cultism, sodomy and others in most of the schools today.
