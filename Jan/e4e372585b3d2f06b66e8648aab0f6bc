Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed, has approved the revalidation of employment of 1, 061 pre-service medical students into the state’s main civil service. The governor’s approval was conveyed in a statement issued on Wednesday by the state Head of Civil Service, Alhaji Yahuza Adamu Haruna, adding that the true position of the pre-service medical students would be ascertained before appointment letters would be given to them. According to the statement, the approval was part of efforts of the state government aimed at improving the state’s health sector from the grassroot levels as well as human capital investment in the sector. In a related development, Governor Mohammed has directed for the verification of the veterinary students of the Ministry of Agriculture for their proper placement into the state’s main civil service. According to the Head of Civil Service, this was part of deliberate attempts designed by the Governor Mohammed-led administration in the state to provide job opportunities to the youth in the state. He, however, commended the governor for his support to the state’s civil service and called on the civil servants in the state to reciprocate the kind gesture through dedication and hard work.
