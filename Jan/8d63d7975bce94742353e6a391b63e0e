Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State on Monday paid a condolence visit to the family of the late Soun of Ogbomosoland, Oba Jimoh Oyewumi. The monarch died in December 2021 at the age of 95. The monarch who reigned for 48 years has been buried in line with Islamic rites. On Monday, Governor visited the family of the deceased monarch to pay his respects. Makinde while addressing the family of the monarch, said the visit was to officially condole with the family and entire sons and daughters of Ogbomosoland over the demise of the foremost monarch and that of his daughter, Prof. Taibat Danmale, who died on Sunday. Makinde added that the late monarch deserved a state burial and that the state government would ensure he gets one. “The purpose of our visit this morning is to officially condole with the family. I want to say that Baba, as old as he was, left a good legacy and did wonderfully well for the development of not only Ogbomoso land but Oyo State. “I like Baba because he would not hide his feelings. He spoke truth to power. So, we will miss Baba for those qualities. “Those who don’t want unity and progress for our state have been saying a lot of negative things since Baba joined his ancestors. Some said I did not come to condole with the family because I don’t like the people of OgbomosolandThe truth is, all those people making those comments don’t know how close I am to the palace and to Mama (Olori Ibironke). “So, those critics are still free to keep running their mouths. Part of the reason I came is that Baba deserves State Burial and, for me as the Governor of Oyo State, that is exactly what I will give to Baba. So, I am here to discuss with the family personally and whatever we agree on is what I will carry out”.
