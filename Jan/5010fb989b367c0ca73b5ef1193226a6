Former Liverpool player, Mark Lawrenson, has predicted the winner between Manchester United and Aston Villa when both teams clash in the FA Cup third round tie on Monday evening. Man United will host Aston Villa in the FA Cup tie at Old Trafford following their Premier League 1-0 defeat to Wolves on January 3. But Lawrenson believes Ralf Rangnick’s side will edge Aston Villa. Providing his prediction, Lawrenson told BBC Sport, “I am going with Manchester United to edge out Aston Villa on Monday, although it is obvious from the stories coming out of Old Trafford that all is not right within the United dressing room. He added: “I hate seeing those sorts of leaks because, although it could just be one unhappy player behind them, it can easily become an issue that undermines the whole club.” The kick-off time for Man United vs Aston Villa is 8.55 pm.
