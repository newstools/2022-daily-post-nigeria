Former Kogi West lawmaker, Senator Dino Melaye, has cautioned Nigerians against allowing other politicians with poor leadership quality like President Muhammadu Buhari to become the next president of the country. Recall that since the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tiubu declared his intention to run for the presidential position in 2023, other top politicians including the Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi had followed suit. Dino, in a post on his verified Facebook page on Thursday, said “Nigerians can not replace Buhari with Buhari Pro max”. He also rubbished the presidential ambition of Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, describing it as Papa Ajasco’s TV series. The post reads, “Yahaya Bello’s dream of becoming President is a continuation of Papa Ajasco’s TV series. Meanwhile Nigerians can not replace Buhari with Buhari Pro max. SDM”.
