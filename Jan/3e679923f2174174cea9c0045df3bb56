Manchester United interim coach, Ralf Rangnick has named goalkeeper, David de Gea, as the outstanding player following his side’s FA Cup third-round 1-0 win over Aston Villa on Monday night. De Gea was impressive as Man United defeated Aston Villa at Old Trafford, thanks to Scott McTominay’s first-half header. The victory means Man United have now qualified for the FA Cup fourth round where they will take on Middlesbrough. “We have to develop the team into a clean sheet team and that was another one today, but still David de Gea was outstanding again for me today,” Rangnick said at his post-match press conference. “I would have wanted him to have less saves in total, I think we had four or five shots on goal, but again we can still improve even in that area.” Man United’s next game is against Aston Villa in the Premier League this weekend.
