Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has insisted that the Nigerian nation must remain an indivisible entity. This, Abiodun said, became necessary to ensure that the labour of the nation’s fallen heroes was not in vain. According to Abiodun, Nigerians must continue to ensure oneness and unity of Nigeria, saying only one and indivisible nation would ensure peace, progress and development. “This country must remain a one and indivisible country; these are ways we can continue to ensure that the labours of these young men and women are not in vain,” the governor said. Addressing newsmen after the special parade/laying of wreath ceremony to mark the 2022 Armed Forces Remembrance Day Celebration, Abiodun enjoined well-meaning Nigerians to look into the welfare of spouses and children left behind by dead service men and women At the event held at the Arcade Ground of the Governor’s Office, Abeokuta, on Saturday, Abiodun maintained that “we must spend everyday remembering them,” saying this is “in tandem with the stanza of the national anthem which states that the labour of our heroes past must not be in vain.” “I don’t think this is a celebration; It’s more of a time for sober reflection, in terms of the fact that what we are doing today is in commemoration of the period when we had the Civil War. This day replaces the old puppy day and has now become the Armed Forces Remembrance Day. “This day has been set aside to honour our fallen heroes who sacrificed their lives for the unity and the territorial protection from within and from inside this country”, the governor noted.
