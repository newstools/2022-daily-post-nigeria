The United States Mission in Nigeria has extended its visa fee validity to September 2023. The extension is to accommodate applicants who have difficulty booking an appointment for non-immigrant visas. A statement on the Embassy’s website reads: “The United States Embassy and Consulate in Nigeria understand that many visa applicants have paid the visa application processing fee and are still waiting to schedule a visa appointment. “We are working diligently to restore all routine visa operations as quickly and safely as possible. “Be rest assured that the US Mission will extend the validity of your payment (known as MRV fee) until September 30, 2023, to enable all applicants who were unable to schedule a visa appointment as a result of the suspension of routine consular operations an opportunity to schedule and/attend a visa appointment with the already paid fee.” This is coming at a time when applicants have been faced with serious difficulty securing appointment dates. The earliest appointment date given according to applicants is nine months from the date of booking. The Visa fee is only valid for one year from the date of payment but the mission in its statement on the website announced that it has extended validity to September 2023 to enable all applicants get an appointment date. The embassy explained that it is working efficiently to restore routine consular services that were suspended because of COVID-19.
