The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) says it convicted 123 illicit drug dealers in three states of the northeast last year. The agency also says it seized a total of 4,858 kilogrammes of illicit drugs in the states within the period in view. The NDLEA Zonal Commander for Zone B covering Adamawa, Gombe and Taraba states, Idris Bello, who disclosed this Wednesday in Yola, the Adamawa State capital, said that in the year under review the zonal command arrested 8,074 suspects for drug-related offences. “In 2021, the Zonal Command, Zone B, seized 4,858kg of various illicit drugs and secured the conviction of 123 persons while 139 cases are pending in court. “Also, we counselled 139 people in the three states under the zone,” Bello said. Bello, who announced that two drug addicts willingly submitted themselves to the command for counselling and rehabilitation, added that one of the two is now in a higher institution of learning in Adamawa State. He expressed regret however that 2021 was also a year when two officials of the command were molested in Adamawa, with one losing his life. “One of the staff was killed while the other was seriously injured and had to be hospitalised,” he said.
