A senior lecturer at the Benue State University, Makurdi, Dr John Ogi has advised Nigerian youths to strategize towards establishing a better government in the forthcoming 2023 general elections. In a chat with DAILY POST, the 35-year-old academic urged the Nigerian youths to shun violence in the name of supporting their favourite politicians. He said the 2023 elections will not be as usual, warning that Nigerians need to put tribal, religious and other differences aside to ensure better governance in the next political era. He said, “Nobody should fight because of any politician, limit your social media outburst because of anyone’s candidature. “Any married politician that has children that are grown up and we don’t see their children posting about the aspiration of their parents just forget it. 2023 is no game, as usual, we must get it right. “The problem has never been the political offices available or the occupants. A larger part of the problem begins with us thinking that every rich person is a good leader and every educated person is a technocrat who can handle government. “The other part is when we think that once a person from a majority tribe is in position then things will work. Until we look beyond tribe, party, wealth, connections to capacity we are not close to starting our movement out of the dark age”.
