Manchester United forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, was left furious with team-mates, Harry Maguire and Mason Greenwood, during their 1-0 win over West Ham on Saturday. The Red Devils looked set to drop two points, but Marcus Rashford netted with the last kick of the game. The result saw United climb above the Hammers into fourth place. But according to The Athletic, Ronaldo was not entirely pleased with his team’s performance, as he was left unhappy with Maguire and Greenwood. It is believed the 36-year-old was frustrated with Maguire, after he failed to pick him out from a clearance. Ronaldo reportedly told Maguire he should have chested the ball down and controlled it rather than heading it away. The Portugal captain also fumed at Greenwood, who ignored him and opted to shoot during a counter-attack. Despite his frustration, after the game, Ronaldo took to Instagram to celebrate his team’s win against West Ham
