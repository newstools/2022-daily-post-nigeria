Former Arsenal star, Paul Merson, has told the club’s board to ‘break the bank’ to sign Fiorentina striker, Dusan Vlahovic at the end of the season. Merson believes Vlahovic will make Arsenal Premier League title contenders next season. Arsenal have been linked with a move for Vlahovic in the past few days. Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, is desperate for a new striker to lead the Gunners’ attack line at the Emirates, with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang exiled from the first team while Alexandre Lacazette’s contract expires in the summer of 2022. Earlier this week, reports claimed that Arsenal had tabled a player-plus-cash deal for the Serbian star, comprising £46million plus Lucas Torreira, who is on loan at Fiorentina this season. “They should be breaking the bank to get Dusan Vlahovic in from Fiorentina in the summer – because he would make them title contenders,’ Merson said in his Daily Star column. “Arsenal would be able to play him every week because Aubameyang will be gone. Alexandre Lacazette will probably be gone. And so will Eddie Nketiah.”
