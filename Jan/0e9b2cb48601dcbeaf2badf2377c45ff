The Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), in Zamfara, Tukur Umar Danfulani has said nothing would snatch power from the ruling party in the state. He made the assertion during a workshop for APC members in the state. Danfulani explained that the world has seen APC in the state being divided but that the perception was not true as people claiming to factionalize the party are not authentic card carriers of the party. “Even though we do not mind, our doors are wide open for sincere people that are ready to join our great party,” he remarked. The chairman called on Wards and Local Government leaders of the party to ensure the proper use of lessons learned from the workshop for the progress of the party. The state publicity secretary of the APC, Yusuf Idris Gusau said the workshop was organized for members to understand the constitution of the party. “We do not organize this program for people to think that we are the ruling government in the state but to educate our teeming members on the constitution of the party”
