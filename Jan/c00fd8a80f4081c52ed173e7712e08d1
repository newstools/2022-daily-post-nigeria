Tottenham boss, Antonio Conte has reacted to Chelsea striker, Romelu Lukaku’s controversial interview where the Belgian criticised the Blues and their manager, Thomas Tuchel. Conte said he will always have ‘great affection’ for Lukaku after the Belgium international angered his manager by publicly airing his frustrations at Chelsea. Lukaku said he was not happy at Stamford Bridge and made it clear that he is keen on returning to Inter at some point in his career. Lukaku said Chelsea was only but his fourth choice with Real Madrid, Barcelona or Bayern Munich ahead of the Stamford Bridge landlords. Conte was asked about the Belgian’s current situation at Stamford Bridge following Tottenham’s victory over Watford on Saturday. “Romelu is a player from another team,” Conte told Sky Sports Italy. “You know the affection I have for him but I am not talking about players from other teams even though I have a great deal of affection for him and that will always be there.” Tuchel, meanwhile, is said to have begun punishing the striker by first of all dropping from his squad to face Liverpool on Sunday.
