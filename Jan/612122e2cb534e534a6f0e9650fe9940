The General Evangelist, Worldwide of the Christ Apostolic Church, CAC, Prophet Samuel Abiara has urged Nigerians to shun prophets of doom in 2022. Abiara said contrary to prophets of doom, the future of Nigeria and that of Lagos State is bright. The CAC General Evangelist spoke at a service held in Lagos House, Marina, Lagos State, to mark the new year. He urged Nigerians to ignore prophets of doom against Nigeria and her leaders at both the national and state levels. “Don’t listen to prophets of doom against Nigeria, our nation and the leaders. Don’t listen to prophets of doom against Lagos State. The future of Nigeria and Lagos State is bright,” Abiara said. Prophet Abiara prayed for the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, his family, and the state Executive Council members. Speaking during the service, Sanwo-Olu said Lagos has a brighter future and urged his cabinet members to work towards achieving the Greater Lagos agenda. He said: “Let us open a new chapter and know that the new chapter is about togetherness. They have said to us that we all have a brighter future. “Our State has a bright future. But it is really for us to open our eyes very well and see the bright future. We should connect to God Almighty and ask for His direction in everything we do.” Meanwhile, several pastors have issued prophecies for the year 2022.
