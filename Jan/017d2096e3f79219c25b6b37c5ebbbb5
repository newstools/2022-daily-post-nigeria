The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Iyorchia Ayu, on Thursday, told presidential aspirant, Dele Momodu, that members of the party, and not leaders, would determine who emerges as the PDP presidential candidate in the 2023 general elections. Ayu said this during Momodu’s visit to the PDP National Secretariat in Abuja where he formally presented his letter of intent to contest for the party’s presidential ticket. The National Chairman noted that the PDP had no preferred presidential candidate and would provide a level-playing ground for all aspirants. Ayu said, “For you to run for office, you must have a strong platform, but the first responsibility I will charge you to do is to work hard and build a strong party with which we can go into battle with. “For your personal ambition like all other candidates, I wish you well, I wish you the best. “There will be a level playing ground for all aspirants, just like you, we don’t have a special candidate, PDP has no preferred candidate, the party members will decide who will contest any office. “If at the end of the day, party members vote for you, PDP will stand behind you. You have to go out and work out there among the party members across the country, because the party leadership will not do it for you. Our job is to try and provide the necessary mechanism.”
