Nigeria is through to the knockout stages of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, following a 3-1 win over Sudan on Saturday. The Super Eagles had beaten Egypt 1-0 in their first Group D fixture. Against the Sudanese, goals from Samuel Chukwueze, Taiwo Awoniyi and Moses Simon gave the three-time champions a three-goal lead. Although Sudan pulled one back, it was merely a consolation goal. Nigeria tops the group with six points ahead of the Egypt vs Guinea-Bissau game.
