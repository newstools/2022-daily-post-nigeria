Lagos State Government has directed the management of Dowen College, Lekki, to make corrections after the death of Sylvester Oromoni.
Commissioner for Education, Folasade Adefisayo said identified lapses in administration discovered during inspection and investigation must be fixed. The ministry’s position on Thursday follows the advice of the Department of Public Prosecution (DPP) which says Oromoni’s death could not be linked to bullying. On the fate of Dowen College students as second term begins, Adefisayo said the government was reviewing the operational guidelines of boarding schools and the requirements for establishment. In a statement, the commissioner announced that the ministry will begin the revalidation of all existing boarding school facilities after the mid-term holidays. She disclosed that monitoring and inspection of schools were being overhauled to improve efficiency. Adefisayo confirmed that Dowen College management had been mandated to work on school governance gaps, as well as other regulatory issues.
