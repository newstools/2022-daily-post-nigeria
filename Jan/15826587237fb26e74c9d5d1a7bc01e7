Aisha Buhari has charged Nigeria women to unite ahead of the 2023 general elections. The First Lady said this would ensure they make a stronger impact in the electoral process. She also wants the All Progressive Congress (APC) to adopt new strategies to ensure more women participate in decision-making. The President’s wife spoke on Monday when she received Liberia’s Vice President, Jewel Howard-Taylor. The VP is in Nigeria for the maiden edition of APC National Progressive Women Conference. Aisha urged stakeholders to support the gender towards realising their demand for increased participation in politics. “Women need to be encouraged to participate more in politics and the country needs our participation. “It is necessary to look forward to how best we can work together to unite women in the forthcoming campaigns ahead of 2023 elections.” She said Howard-Taylor’s presence and words would boost the morale of women participating at the conference. “I am convinced that your record as a former Liberian First Lady and a professional in politics will add value to the event,’’ Aisha added In her remarks, Howard-Taylor called for more allocation of resources for women education, empowerment, protection as well as maternal and child health.
