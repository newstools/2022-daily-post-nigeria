Chelsea defender, Thiago Silva, has revealed the secret to his longevity in the game of football. Silva has already played 29 times for club and country this season. The 37-year-old signed a new contract with Chelsea on Monday that would see him remain at Stamford Bridge until the summer of 2023. The Brazilian centre-back joined Thomas Tuchel’s side from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2020. Asked what the secret to his longevity is, Silva told Chelsea’s official website ahead of their Carabao Cup semi-final first leg tie with Tottenham on Wednesday night: “The first thing is preparation, the organization, not just from the players but from all of the staff. “I have a really good relationship with the staff. It’s great if I’m feeling tired, I can speak to the coaching staff, and I can say that it might be risky to play certain matches, and we think about it and we decide whether it’s better to play or to rest.”
