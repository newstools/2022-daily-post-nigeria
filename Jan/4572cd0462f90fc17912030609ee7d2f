Betty White, Hollywood icon and trailblazing television star is dead. The 99-year-old Emmy-award winning actress died of natural causes at her California home. Her agent and close friend, Jeff Witjas later confirmed her death to People magazine. Witjas in a statement wrote: “Even though Betty was about to be 100, I thought she would live forever. “I’ll miss her terribly and so will the animal world that she loved so much. I don’t think Betty ever feared passing because she always wanted to be with her most beloved husband, Allen Ludden. She believed she would be with him again.” Betty White’s more than eight-decade career had her in unforgettable roles on “The Golden Girls” ‘Boston Legal and “The Mary Tyler Moore Show”. She died less than three weeks before her 100th birthday.
