Marcus Rashford has said that he is ‘disappointed’ with his performances of recent for Manchester United and the reports questioning the commitment of the players to manager Ralf Rangnick and the club. The club is going through a very slow start to life under Rangnick, with many pundits writing them off. Most recently Manchester United fell 1-0 in front of their home fans to Wolves leaving the Red Devils in seventh place in the table. There have been reports of a crisis rocking the dressing room and suggestions of division among the players with as many as 17 of them being unhappy. But in a post on Twitter, Rashford said he is not unhappy at Manchester United, only that he is disappointed at himself following his recent poor displays on the pitch. He wrote: “I read something earlier that said I’d been quiet on here but what can I say that will make this better other than showing you on the pitch? “We’ve all been disappointed with recent performances and we’ve been disappointed with the news coverage questioning our commitment to not only the manager and the coaching staff but the club. “I have endless respect for both and I’m looking forward to bettering my game under the staff at Manchester United. “I’m not sulking, I’m not unhappy, am I disappointed in some of my recent performances? Of course, I am. I’m my own biggest critic. “It’s been a tough start but I’m determined to prove my worth. My dedication and my desire to be here should never be in question. I love this club.”
