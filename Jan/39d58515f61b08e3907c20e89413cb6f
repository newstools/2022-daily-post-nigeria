President Muhammadu Buhari and the National Leader of the All Progressive Congress, Bola Ahmed Tinubu are currently having a closed-door meeting at the Presidential Villa Abuja. Although the purpose of the meeting is still sketchy as at the time of filing this report, DAILY POST gathered that the meeting may not be unconnected with the 2023 Presidential election which Tinubu is believed to be nursing an ambition over. The APC National leader made a similar visit to the Villa on October 31, 2021, on the guise that he had come to thank the President for visiting him while undergoing treatment for a knee injury. But sources privy to today’s meeting equally said it may not also be unconnected with the recent warning by the President, during an exclusive interview in Abuja, that the major opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party stands a chance of clinching power in 2023 if the ruling party does not put its house in order.
