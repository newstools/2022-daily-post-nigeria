A 32-year-old suspected yahoo boy, identified as Afeez Olalere, has confessed to killing his younger brother for money ritual. Olalere was arrested by operatives of the Lagos State Police Command during a stop-and-search operation along Itamaga, Ikorodu Road, in Lagos State. During interrogation, the suspect said that his mother encouraged him to kill his younger brother after a herbalist told them that he has to “sacrifice one life which must be a sibling to him”. Olalere said: “My mother took me to a herbalist who told me if I want to be successful in the yahoo business, I will have to sacrifice one life and that person must be a sibling to me.” “So, we went back home and thought about it, then my mother suggested that we use my younger brother since he is just 21 years old. He added that he gave his 21-year-old brother a poison after which he died 20 minutes after drinking it. “We harvested the required body parts, while the remains was wrapped and taken to a mortuary. “The things we needed to prepare a concoction with was his thumbs, his hair, fingers and a passport photograph,” he confessed.
