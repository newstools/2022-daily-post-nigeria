A Yoruba traditional ruler, the Olofin of Ado-Odo, Oba Lateef Adeniran, has died. The Ogun State first-class monarch joined his ancestors on Friday and he was buried same day. Defying the usual rituals that do follow the death of a typical Yoruba traditional ruler, Oba Adeniran was buried according to his Islamic rites. Islamic clerics had gathered at Ado-Odo to observe Salat al-janazah (a funeral prayer) at an open space, with the remains of the monarch laid before them. The body was later lowered into the grave as many gathered to bid the monarch farewell. Our correspondent reported that a three-time former member of the House of Representatives, Hon. Abiodun Akinlade, was present at the funeral. Oba Adeniran who clocked 63 in December, relocated from Ado-Odo to Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital in April 2013, after he was attacked and stripped naked by some angry youths. The royal father was flagged down in his car by the youths, who were said to have earlier invaded his palace to vandalise vehicles and torch his property. It was gathered that the youths were protesting a Supreme Court judgment of January 12, 2009, which validated Adeniran’s appointment as the Oba of the ancient town. But, in December 2020, the Olofin returned to Ado-Odo amidst pomp and pageantry. After his return, the monarch organised a fundraiser for the construction of a modern palace, which is yet to be completed until he breathed his last.
