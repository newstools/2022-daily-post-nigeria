Former military Head of State, Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (IBB) has advocated for a young President in 2023. IBB said Nigeria’s ideal President must not be an old person like him. He stressed that the country’s next President must be a very good communicator. IBB noted that Nigeria’s President should be able to engage people on any issue concerning the country. “He should be able to communicate because a president should be able to walk into a group of people and talk to them on issues concerning Nigeria; not all the time but most of the time. “He must have somebody he knows in every part of the country. It is not a tall order. “You could limit it to states, you could limit it to local governments even to the wards if you can but somebody such that once you hear the name, it is somebody you will say, yes, I have heard that name before either in the country or in his profession; if he is a doctor, a journalist or whatever, all areas, we have heard the name before; okay then I will make an effort to know more about him,” he told Daily Trust. As 2023 draws closer, some Nigerians who are advanced in age are beginning to declare their intentions to run for the presidency.
