Pained by the series of unfortunate incidents that follow the use of lorries and trucks in conveying their members to conferences, the Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has warned the Synod of the NKST to desist from such acts forthwith. This followed reported accident cases by congregants to this year’s conference at Atukpu, Taraku in Gwer East Local Government Area. Governor Ortom gave the warning Sunday, January 2nd, 2022 while addressing the congregation at the ongoing MIM National Conference at NKST Atukpu, Gwer West Local Government Area of Benue State. He called for more diligent planning where adequate transportation and other logistics will be made for such events. He said instead of using the antiquated lorries, the leadership of various churches could start planning early to be able to use buses for such transportation in order to minimize the danger of using trucks in cases of accidents. Governor Ortom traced the fruits of dedicating Benue State to God with the selection of men of God becoming traditional rulers, stressing that by this alone, more traditional rulers have become active members in the Church. The Governor charged the congregation to exhibit holiness not only at conventions but in their homes and workplaces, expressing the hope that participants at the convention will return with fantastic testimonies. Governor Ortom donated a Generator set for the convention and also directed that a sound set system be provided for use at the event for a better audience. Ter Tyoshin, Chief Daniel Abomtse in a remark, appealed for the completion of Naka-Agagbe road, installation of a transformer at Government Comprehensive Secondary School Naka among others. The theme of the conference which began on the 30th December 2021 and is to end on the 8th January 2022 is “stand firm in the faith.”
