Tottenham Hotspur manager, Antonio Conte, has said it will be a “good thing” if Romelu Lukaku returns to the Chelsea squad in their Carabao Cup tie on Wednesday evening. Lukaku was snubbed by Thomas Tuchel for their 2-2 draw with Liverpool on Sunday. Tuchel took the decision after the 28-year-old’s controversial interview claiming he was unhappy with his situation at Stamford Bridge. Lukaku is expected to be left out against Spurs again. But Conte insists he wants Spurs to play Chelsea with their strongest players on the pitch. “I think it’s always a good thing to play against a team that have all their players available. “I think that for the people who watch the game, it’s good to see the best players on the pitch,” Conte said. Asked if he felt sorry for the criticism Lukaku has received, Conte replied: “Honestly, I’d like to not speak about Romelu. “Because Romelu is now a player from another team. I think it would be disrespectful to speak about him and about Chelsea.”
