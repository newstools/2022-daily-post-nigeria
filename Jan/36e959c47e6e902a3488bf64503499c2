Chelsea transfer chief, Marina Granovskaia, is close to signing £50m rated star, Jules Kounde for the Premier League giants. Kounde, who currently plays for Sevilla, wanted to move to Chelsea last summer, with the Blues keen to do a deal for the 23-year-old. Chelsea initially believed they had reached an agreement over Kounde’s fee, only for Sevilla to raise their asking price by £12.8million to £68.5m, a figure which the Champions League holders refused to match. However, according to Tutto Mercato Web, Granovskaia is already leading an attempt to close a deal for the summer. With add-ons included, the fee for Kounde could reach £50million. The report added that a deal between Chelsea and Kounde’ seems close’, and Granovskaia could finally put an end to last summer’s frustration where they narrowly missed out on the France international.
