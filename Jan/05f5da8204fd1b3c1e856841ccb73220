Dr Sani Abdulahi Shinkafi, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has dismissed the claim that there are two other factions of the party in the state led by former Governor Abdulaziz Yari and Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa. Fielding questions from BBC Hausa Service monitored by DAILY POST in Gusau, the state capital, Dr Shinkafi, who is one of the contestants for the party’s national chairmanship, said that both ex-Governor Yari and Senator Marafa have since expelled themselves from the party. According to him, the party is one in the state, saying that there is no faction in the state, stressing that the duo was only deceiving their supporters and do not want to tell them the truth. Dr Shinkafi explained that Yari was rejected after he presented his old membership card when he went to the national secretariat of the party to buy an expression form for the national chairmanship contest. “The national secretariat of the party is fully in support of Governor Matawalle’ group and has always been accord the group all necessary legitimacy,” he said. He refuted the claim of fractionalization of the party in the state, noting that the national secretariat of the party does not even recognize the so-called factions. “We are surprised by the claim by none members of the party that two other factions of the party exist in Zamfara State led by former Governor Abdul Aziz Yari and senator Kabiru Garbage Marafa,” he said. “When senator Kabiru Garba Marafa conducted his parallel Congresses in the state where did he submit his result? Definitely not the national secretariat of the party” Recall that Dr Sani Abdulahi Shinkafi was the former national secretary of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and has been the governorship candidate of the party since 2015 but defected to the APC with Governor Matawalle last year.
