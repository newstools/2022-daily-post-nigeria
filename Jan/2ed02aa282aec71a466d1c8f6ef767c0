Former CNN host, Piers Morgan, has slammed Arsenal following their FA Cup exit at the hands of Nottingham Forest on Sunday. Morgan, a strong Arsenal fan, described the performances of the Gunners as ‘dreadful’ while also slamming the team for ‘dressing and playing like Tottenham’. Mikel Arteta’s side was beaten 1-0 in the FA Cup third-round tie at the weekend, thanks to Lewis Grabban’s late goal. The defeat means Arsenal is out of the season’s FA Cup. Reacting, Morgan, in a tweet via his Twitter handle, wrote: “Can someone please tell Arsenal players that playing in white shirts doesn’t mean we have to play as badly as Spurs?. He added, “Dressed like Tottenham, played like Tottenham. Dreadful performance” He added a vomiting emoji to emphasise his despair.
