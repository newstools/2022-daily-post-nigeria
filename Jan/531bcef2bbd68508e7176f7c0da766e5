The Leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, on Tuesday, hinted on who would become the next governor of Delta State. Primate Ayodele named three people who are likely to become the next governor of the State. In a statement by his media aide, Osho Oluwatosin, the clergyman named a two-time Commissioner for Works, Augoye James, Deputy Governor of the State, Kingsley Otuaro, and Senator James Manager as possible candidates to succeed Governor Ifeanyi Okowa. He further explained that among them, James is the best person to emerge as the next governor, while advising the governor to consult God so as to put Delta State in safe hands. ‘’On Delta governorship election in 2023, I see a two-time commissioner for works, Augoye James, Deputy governor of the State, Kingsley Otuaro, and Senator James Manager as likely persons to become the next governor. ‘’Out of these three, Augoye James is the anointed one who will not disappoint the Governor and the people of Delta State’. ‘’The Governor should be careful, watch and pray for God’s direction on who succeeds him but who I see is James Augoye,” he said.
