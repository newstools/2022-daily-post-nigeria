President Muhammadu Buhari, at the weekend, extended heartfelt condolences to the government and people of Oyo State, the Royal Family, the Olubadan-in-council and the people of Ibadan over the death of Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji. As the funeral rites of the Adetunji get underway in Ibadan, Buhari trusts that the process of ‘selecting his successor will be guided by wisdom, understanding and good judgment that exemplified the life he lived.’ Buhari said that the late Kabiyesi was a visionary and compassionate leader, who used the spheres of his influence as a respected traditional ruler and a lover of the creative industry to advance the progress of his people, encouraging and motivating them to give their best in their vocation and to the nation. Buhari’s condolence was contained in a statement by his spokesman, Femi Adesina, on Sunday. While Adetunji’s demise understandably leaves a huge void to fill, Buhari urged the people of Ibadan and Nigerians from different walks of life to honour the eternal memory of the late monarch by imbibing the virtues he cherished so much: generosity, peace, tolerance and devotion to unity. President Buhari prayed God to grant the soul of Adetunji eternal rest and comfort his family, associates, friends and subjects he left behind. Adetunji, who ascended the throne in 2016, died in the early hours of Sunday. He died at the age of 93. DAILY POST gathered that the next person to ascend the throne is High Chief Lekan Balogun.
