The First Lady of Nigeria, Aisha Buhari, has called on the All Progressives Congress (APC) to go beyond “lip service” and ensure more women occupy strategic positions in the party. Aisha stated this while speaking at the maiden edition of the APC national women conference which was held in Abuja on Tuesday. According to her, as the country prepares for the general elections in 2023, the future of Nigeria depends on the potential of women. “Since 2015, I’ve had the privilege of engaging women across the country. My conviction is that Nigeria’s future is entirely dependent on using the potential of our women. “It is no mere coincidence that parties that are strong, prosperous and influential have prioritized women’s participation in national building,” Aisha said. She added: “I therefore call upon the APC to double its efforts in promoting women, which I believe will serve as one of the objectives of this conference. “As Nigeria races towards another election, we must go beyond paying lip service to putting women in vital offices within our party and the government.” Aisha’s comments come as Khadijah Okunnu-Lamidi became the first woman to declare her interest in contesting for president of Nigeria in the 2023 general election.
