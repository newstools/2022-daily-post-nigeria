Former Manchester United striker, Paul Ince, has slammed four Red Devils players – Fred, Scott McTominay, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Sancho. Ince said that Fred, McTominay, Wan-Bissaka and Sancho are not good enough for Man United. He also insisted that Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes could leave Old Trafford. “Ronaldo’s got a year left, he is not the future. Nor is [Edinson] Cavani. [Paul] Pogba could be gone. Bruno [Fernandes] could go,” Ince told The United Stand. “You look at the players that are playing now. Fred isn’t good enough, we know that. [Scott] McTominay is not good enough, we know that. [Aaron] Wan-Bissaka has lost all his confidence, he is not the right choice. [Jadon] Sancho looks miles off it. “If you bring a new manager in, you have got to change 80 per cent of the team and still try to keep up to Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea’s standards. “Manchester United have got a long, long way to go, and I can’t see Ralf Rangnick being in charge next year.” —
