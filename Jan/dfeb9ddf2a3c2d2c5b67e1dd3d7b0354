President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned fresh killings in Bassa Local Government of Plateau State, saying instances where warring communities engage in retaliatory attacks won’t be condoned. The President also expressed sadness over the killings, insisting that the recent incident is not in keeping with the principles of the peace agreements reached between the Irigwe and the Fulani in the area. Buhari’s displeasure was conveyed in a statement made available to DAILY POST by his media aide, Garba Shehu, on Thursday. “My thoughts are with the families of the victims in this time of grief. May their souls rest in peace. I urge the various communities in the area, and particularly the Plateau State Interreligious Council to do everything possible to commit to the peace agreement and prevent it from falling apart. “Every group taking the law into their hands claims to be retaliating. As a society, there is no place for this sort of violence. This is unacceptable,” said the President. The President commended Governor Simon Lalong for the state government’s handling of the incident so far. Recall that before the latest killings in Plateau State, over 200 persons were allegedly massacred in Zamfara State, a development that President Buhari also condemned in strong terms.
