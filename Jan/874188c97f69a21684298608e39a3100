Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, has claimed Wolverhampton Wanderers are the best team he has faced while in charge. The 63-year-old suffered his first defeat as Red Devils’ boss against Bruno Lage’s men on Monday night. United barely threatened the visitors at Old Trafford, before Joao Moutinho’s long-range finish with seven minutes sealed the win for Wolves. “Wolves were the best team we have played, collectively and individually, and we had more problems today than in other games,” Rangnick said after the game. Since taking over at United, the German has either won or drawn the five games he has taken charge of. “We’ve been only working two and a half or three weeks after needing to close the training centre. We had the results. In times we played well but today we have to admit they’re better than us,” he added.
