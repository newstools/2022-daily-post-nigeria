President Muhammadu Buhari has urged Nigerians to seek divine intervention to end the challenges facing the country. Buhari made the call at the national prayer session for Nigeria, organised by the Kano State Government, on Saturday. Represented by Mustapha Babai, Minister of State for Agriculture, Buhari said his administration was working towards tackling insecurity. The President noted that his government was supporting security agents in a bid to tackle insecurity in the country. He said, “Despite the support, there is a need to seek divine intervention for the Almighty to bring an end to the challenges. “No doubt, Nigeria is facing security challenges and we are doing our best to support the security personnel. That does not mean we should not seek divine intervention. This prayer session is part of the interventions and I commend the State governor for this.” He also commended Governor Abdullahi Ganduje for ensuring security in Kano State. “I am very happy with this initiative. Indeed Ganduje is doing well in securing Kano and has given his quota to achieving peace in the country at large,” he said.
