Founder of Living Faith Church, Bishop David Oyedepo says the wealth his ministry is currently enjoying is a product of his many years of labour for God. Speaking during the ongoing 21 Days Prayer and Fasting on Tuesday, the richest African pastor said buying a plane does not put the church under pressure, saying they will keep flying forever. He urged the congregation to remain dedicated in their service to God, stressing that the dividend of their labour would speak at the end. According to him, “The labour of several years of many of us in the faith, who have refused to give up and to bow out will come to light this year. “We were not driving a brand-new car when God gave us a plane and to show that it is God who gave us, we are still flying up till now and we are flying forever. “A plane in this Church is not anything serious. It doesn’t call for any attention, it has never required prayer. “Where God is taking you to will be pressure-free. Just keep on. No stopping, no parking, keep going. The end is always sweeter than whatever the process may look like”.
