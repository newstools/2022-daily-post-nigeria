Senate Chief Whip, Orji Kalu, says he doesn’t belong to any group or faction in the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abia as 2023 draws near. A statement by his media office on Monday maintained that the state chapter is united. The former Abia Governor debunked claims that his absence from the APC reconciliation meeting meant he was working with the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). Kalu said since the APC observes probity, transparency and accountability, no individual can hijack the structure. The businessman condemned the linking of card-carrying members of APC as “members of Orji Kalu group”. Kalu told the National Reconciliation Committee led by Sen. Abdullahi Adamu to ignore allegations against him. “It is unfortunate, disheartening and wicked that a minority in Abia, who don’t have the capacity to win elections can make false and defamatory statements against Sen. Orji Kalu. “Kalu during the 2019 general elections used his resources to win seats in the national assembly despite the stiff resistance by the PDP-led Abia Government. “Kalu has sustained his leadership in APC in Abia by consistently deploying human and financial resources to galvanise grassroots support for the party. “Kalu will not join issues with anyone as he will not allow people without electoral value distract him from focusing on delivering the dividends of democracy to the people.” The statement added that the lawmaker remains neutral and plays a father to all within the party.
