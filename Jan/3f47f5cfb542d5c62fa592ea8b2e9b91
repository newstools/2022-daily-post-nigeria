Building Collapse Prevention Guild (BCPG) has bemoaned the spate of slump in the state, especially in Ikoyi and Lekki areas. During a visit to the Oniru of Iru Land on Monday, Oba Gbolahan Lawal, the body lamented that Nigeria’s image had been damaged. Kunle Awobodu, the Founder, said the 21-storey building which caved in on Gerrard Road in Ikoyi put the nation in a bad light. At least 45 people died in the November 2021 incident. Curiously, the probe panel set up by the Lagos government sat for weeks without media coverage. The BCPG Pioneer President noted that if a house is well built, there would be no fear of an emergency such as collapse. “We were trained in building construction. If we are well trained, should Nigerians be facing this perennial disaster that has damaged our image across the world?” he asked. Awobodu appealed to the Oniru and his colleagues to avert future occurrences by insisting on expertise and professionalism. The delegation leader charged the traditional ruler to speak with the King of Ikate Elegushi, Oba Saheed Elegushi and others to adopt measures against quacks. “The developers here, some of them, formerly traders at Alaba, are now into construction. “We need to work with the Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development and professionals like BCPG to reduce the havoc these people are creating”, he urged. Speaking, the Oniru said collaboration with the BCPG would checkmate construction infractions on Lekki and environs. Oba Lawal told the guests that his experience as a former Lagos Commissioner for Housing made the partnership with the guild imperative. The monarch recalled how his work with Awobodu on the training of artisans and other initiatives resulted in positive results.
