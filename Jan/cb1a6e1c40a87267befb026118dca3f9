The Kwara State Police Command has refuted reports that the fleeing Zamfara State bandits kingpin, Bello Turji, has relocated to an unidentified forest in the state. A statement by the spokesman of the command, Okasanmi Ajayi, in Ilorin on Wednesday, said the clarification became necessary to diffuse the tension already created in the minds of the public by the statement credited to one Federal lawmaker in the House of Representatives to the effect that the kingpin and his gang have relocated to an unidentified forest in Kwara State. “However, the statement by the lawmaker did not reveal the source or veracity of its assertion,” the police spokesman noted, assuring that “Kwara state is safe and secure.” Okasanmi said “All the boundaries, both local and international within the state have been well and massively policed by both the police and the military. “Vigilante and local hunters are working tirelessly with security agents to ensure our forests are well monitored and protected,” he added. The spokesman disclosed that the state Police Commissioner, Tuesday Assayomo, has directed a 24-hour patrol of all entry and exit points to the state, while tactical units have been re-energized with provision of additional patrol vehicles and other needed tools and incentives to aid their performance. The commissioner also advised the public to make information of strange movements and activities around them available to the security agencies at all times. DAILY POST recalls that the rumour of the bandits kingpin, Bello Turji and his gang went viral to the effect that he had relocated to Kwara State, following the onslaught by security forces on their hideouts in Zamfara State, recently.
