The Executive Committee of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) at the weekend announced new rules on number of players and substitutions. CAF said teams participating in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, must play their fixtures if they have at least eleven players who have tested negative for COVID-19. It also said that in case there are no goalkeepers available in the squad, an outfield player will be required to play in goal. “A team that does not have a minimum of 11 players available will be considered to have lost the match 0-2,” CAF’s statement read in part. “In exceptional cases, the organising committee of the Africa Cup of Nations will take the appropriate decision. “The organisers said teams will be able to make five substitutions per match and an additional substitution if a game goes into extra time.” Meanwhile, a number of teams preparing for the 2021 AFCON have reported positive COVID-19 cases, including Algeria, Ivory Coast and Morocco. The tournament begins on Sunday evening, with host nation Cameroon taking on Burkina Faso.
