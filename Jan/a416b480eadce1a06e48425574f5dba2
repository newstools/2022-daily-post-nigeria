Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State has, ahead of the 2023 general election, lifted the ban on governorship aspirants in the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, from embarking on consultation and political activities in the state. Umahi made this known while briefing journalists shortly after the enlarged executive council meeting that took place at the new Government House, Centenary City, Abakaliki, the state capital. Umahi, who spoke through the Commissioner of Information and State Orientation, Mr Uchenna Orji, announced the nullification of the employment made by the provost of Ikwo College of Education, Ebonyi State. According to him: “The Chairman-In-Council announced the lifting of the ban on political consultations ahead of the 2023 General Elections and expressed determination to consult widely especially with the House of Assembly, the EXCO, the Elders Council, Founding Fathers, Women Organizations, CAN and other relevant groups with a view to getting opinions on where the Governorship position shall be zoned to. “For the Governorship seat, he made it clear that Ebonyi South, having benefited from the principle of zoning, shall not be allowed to contest as his administration’s support shall be for Abakaliki block. “EXCO noted the intention of the Chairman of Council and kick-started the debate on where the Governorship seat will be zoned between North and Central Zones.” “Executive Council received and deliberated upon a security report that revealed the involvement of the Provost and management of Ebonyi State College of Education Ikwo in illegal employment which they did secretly without recourse to due process and EXCO approved the suspension of the Provost and the Bursar of the institution. EXCO, therefore, constituted a committee to investigate the allegations and submit findings and recommendations within two weeks,” he added.
