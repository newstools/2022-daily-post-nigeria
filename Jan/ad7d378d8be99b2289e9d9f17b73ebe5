Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo has said he does not foresee Nigeria disintegrating on account of ethnic or religious sentiments. Osinbajo was in Azare, Bauchi State, to represent President Muhammadu Buhari at the wedding ceremony of former Ms. Fatima Adamu, (the daughter of Mallam Adamu Adamu, the Education Minister). At a brief stop over at the Palace of the Emir of Katagum, Alhaji Umar Farouk, Osinbajo said, “this is one occasion where you will find that our country is truly a united country and that nothing can separate this country, not ethnicity or religion or class. There is nothing that can separate this country. In fact, this is excellent evidence of the fact that this country is united.” The VP also siezed the wedding ceremony to commend the Education Minister for believing in a united Nigeria and building bridges across party and religious lines. Making further remarks, he said dignitaries who graced the event did so against all odds because of their personal relationship with the minister. Among dignitaries present at the event include, Senate President, Ahmed Lawan; Governors Abubakar Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi; Babagana Zulum of Borno; Mr Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti; Mohammed Badaru Abubakar of Jigawa; Simon Lalong of Plateau; Mai Mala Buni of Yobe and host, Bala Mohammed of Bauchi. Also the founding Chairman of the APC, Chief Bisi Akande and National Leader of the party, Ashiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Also present were Ministers of Transportation: Mr Rotimi Amaechi; Information & Culture: Alhaji Lai Mohammed; and the Communications & Digital Economy: Dr Ali Isa Pantami. Although Buhari was not physically present at the wedding ceremony, Adamu, who is an accountant and a journalist, is currently serving out a second term as Minister of Education. He is believed to be a strong ally of the President since the days of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change.
