Reacting after the game, Queiroz said at his post-match press conference that he was satisfied with the performance of his players, adding that they fought together against Morocco. Salah, meanwhile, said that the Pharaohs played a good game against their North African counterpart. Queiroz said, “Both teams deserved to qualify for the semi-finals with great players on both sides. I am satisfied with the performance of my players. We have a good group with players who fight together in all compartments. Mohamed Salah had a good match today, but for me, we have to congratulate the whole team. We have several injured players, but all the players gave their best to win this match.” On his part, Salah said, “I think we played a good game against a very good Moroccan team. My teammates do what is necessary in each game and give everything to go as far as possible. Playing two games in a row with extra time is not easy, but I can tell you that we are well and we are having a very good tournament.”
