Maverick entertainer, Charly Boy has warned that the year 2022 will be rugged in Nigeria. Charlyboy said this on his Instagram page while condemning the essence of crossover services in church. His post read, “What kind of assurance them Yeye pastor Dey give them. What exactly is the significance of cross over services? Is it stated in the Bible?

For those that don’t have mind you are free to die now.” Charlyboy also slammed those criticizing him, declaring that he will be more salvage in 2022. “I have resolved to be more salvage in 2022. So get ready because the truth hurts hypocrites a lot,” he added.
