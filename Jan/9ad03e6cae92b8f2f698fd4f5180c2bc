Manchester United have picked Paris Saint-Germain striker, Mauro Icardi as the replacement for departing Edinson Cavani and Anthony Martial. Both players are asking to leave Old Trafford this January, though United are yet to give the green light for their exit. Martial has reportedly agreed to join Sevilla on loan in January, in search of more first-team football, while Cavani, who is being chased by Barcelona, may remain at Old Trafford till June when his contract would run down. And L’Equipe reports that Icardi has been picked as the potential replacement if both Martial and Cavani leave in January. Icardi joined PSG from Inter Milan in 2019 on loan and made the deal permanent a year later. And since then, the Argentina star has scored 38 goals in 82 games. United have made contact with PSG over the 28-year-old but are said to be preparing an approach if Martial and Cavani move closer to leaving.
