Names of about four top strikers Chelsea could sign in the 2022 summer transfer window to replace Romelu Lukaku have emerged. The transfer window offers the chance to rebalance the squad and address any glaring issues. Chelsea only signed Lukaku back in the summer of 2021 transfer window but, in the wake of his recent controversial interview where he criticized Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel and hinted he would like to return back to Inter Milan in the near future. The Champions holders could sell Lukaku at the end of the season following his recent explosive interview. However, according to Express Sport, the first player Chelsea board could sign as Lukaku’s possible replacement is Erling Haaland of Borussia Dortmund. Chelsea didn’t initially want Lukaku back at Stamford Bridge last summer. Instead, Tuchel hoped to bring Haaland to the club after Dortmund refused to let the Norway international leaves Germany. Haaland, who scored 40 goals for Dortmund across all competitions last season, will be available for just £66million this year due to a clause in his contract. Another player Chelsea could sign as Lukak’s replacement is Inter Milan’s Lautaro Martinez, who was also expected to join Lukaku out of the Serie A champions’ exit door last summer. However, the Argentine international ended up staying at the San Siro and signing a new contract with the club. The third player is Harry Kane of Tottenham Hotspur, who wanted to leave Spurs last season but ended up staying at the club after Antonio Conte’s side refused to let him leave. And the fourth player is Real Sociedad’s Alexander Isak, who has been linked with Chelsea’s Premier League rivals, Arsenal.
