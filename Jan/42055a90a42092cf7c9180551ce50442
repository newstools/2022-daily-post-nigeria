Argentina players have complained about the treatment meted on the team and officials during the Argentina qualifying game against Chile on Thursday. Argentine midfielder, Rodrigo De Paul said Chile mistreated Argentina during their trip to Calama. The midfielder said the hosts did not let the visitors use the bathroom, among other complaints. Argentina said it would never handle an opponent in that fashion. Despite the mistreatment, Argentina went ahead to beat their host 2-1 thanks to goals from Angel Di Maria and Lautaro Martinez. “They didn’t even let us go to the bathroom when we got off the plane,” De Paul told reporters. “They cut off our air conditioners, we had no water and they made sirens sound throughout the stay.” He said.
