Chelsea goalkeeper, Edouard Mendy has said that his Senegal international teammate, Sadio Mane should have been sent off during both teams’ Premier League 2-2 draw on Sunday. Mane caught Cesar Azpilicueta with an elbow in just six seconds during the encounter at Stamford Bridge. The Reds forward only got a yellow card after his arm caught Azpilicueta in the face while he was challenging for the ball in the air. But the result may have been completely different had Mane seen red so early in the game. Mendy was asked for his opinion after the game on whether Mane should have been given his marching orders. The shot-stopper told RMC Sport: “Sadio is my brother, my compatriot. But he should not have stayed on the pitch after one minute.” Meanwhile, just hours after Mane scored past Mendy to put Liverpool ahead in the contest, the duo have been pictured together on the plane as they jet off for the African Cup of Nations, AFCON.
