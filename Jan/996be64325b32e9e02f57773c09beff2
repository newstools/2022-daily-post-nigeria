A former Osun State Commissioner for Finance, Budget and Economic Planning, Wale Bolorunduro has claimed the state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola retains the responsibility of telling the people how state funds were spent between 2011 and 2018. His comments followed a request by a group, The Osun Masterminds who are demanding that the state debt profile be made public. Bolorunduro alleged that Oyetola was the Chief of Staff to former Governor, Rauf Aregbesola and supervised all debt issues, approved all fund allocations and was privy to how all loans obtained were deployed. The Osun Masterminds had also requested Governor Oyetola to demand from his predecessor, Aregbesola the debt profile of the state. But the former Commissioner, who held that the group was sponsored to tarnish the image of Aregbesola, advised it to seek clarification and proper knowledge on debt issues. Bolorunduro explained that Oyetola was the chairman of the Board of Osun Debt Management office during the tenure of Rauf Aregbesola and had an inventory of all debts. The former commissioner said he handed over the finance portfolio of the state to Governor Oyetola in 2014 when he was the Chief of Staff. He also added that as the Chief Of Staff then, he was also the one confirming final funds released by banks until Commissioners were appointed in May 2017. The Osun Masterminds, a social accountability group, had last week, requested Governor Oyetola to make public, the state’s debt profile. They are also asking Oyetola to request his predecessor, Aregbesola, to give an account of all loans taken by the state during his tenure.
