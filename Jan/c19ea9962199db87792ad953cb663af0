Former midfielder, Austin Jay-Jay Okocha, has said Nigeria have reclaimed their “fear factor” at the ongoing 2021 Africa Cup of Nations tournament. The Super Eagles beat Egypt 1-0 to lay down a marker in their opening fixture. They then recorded a comprehensive 3-1 victory over Sudan to go top of Group D. In both games, Augustine Eguavoen’s men looked solid in defence and were quick on attack. It was reminiscent of the years when Nigeria was Africa’s top-ranked team and feared by sides within and outside the continent. In recent years, the three-time champions have fallen short and were stunned by Central African Republic (CAR) in 2022 World Cup qualifying. However, Okocha speaking with ESPN, feels their displays in Cameroon is beginning to change perception. “The fear factor is back. “You see how we won our first two matches convincingly, so I think we remain a big threat in this tournament,” Okocha said.
