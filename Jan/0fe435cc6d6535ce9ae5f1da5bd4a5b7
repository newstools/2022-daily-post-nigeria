The All Progressives Congress (APC) has hailed President Muhammadu Buhari and citizens “for standing firm against the interference of Twitter Inc. in Nigeria’s internal and national security affairs”. The party said Buhari stood up for the sovereignty of the country until Twitter acceded to all six demands of the Federal Government concerning their practices. The position was contained in a statement on Thursday by John Akpan Udoedehe, National Secretary, APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC). The scribe applauded Twitter, an American company, for agreeing to open their office in Nigeria. He called it a win-win that will create jobs and opportunities for Nigerians in the global digital space. APC said by also agreeing to enroll Nigeria in its Partner Support and Law Enforcement Portals, Twitter has demonstrated commitment to help to fight crime and criminals on their platform. “Still, we should not rest on our oars. Russia has VKontakte (VK), China has Weibo, among several homegrown social media platforms. “Nigerians talented in the development of social media/software applications are challenged to develop homegrown applications that can rival existing social media platforms and meet the needs of Nigerians.” The APC told social media operators to desist from fake news, divisive and inciting rhetoric. The ruling platform reminded them of their responsibility to curb disinformation, hate speech, among others.
