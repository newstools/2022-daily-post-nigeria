The presidency says the elite in Nigeria are eager to see President Muhammadu Buhari leave office. In a statement on Wednesday, a spokesman, Garba Shehu said the high and mighty prefer embezzlement of public funds. Shehu noted that politicians were missing the easy export of ill-gotten money to foreign bank accounts. He said, “Many of the political elites of this country cannot wait for the President’s second term in office to end. The last thing they want is ‘another Buhari’.” The aide said whether his successor lives up to the standards Buhari has set or not, his legacy is strong and will be tough to dismantle. Shehu hailed the Nigerian leader for the repatriation of stolen funds as using the same to fund social, unemployment and welfare programmes. He mentioned government reforms, tackling of ethnic and tribal disputes, such as the farmer-herder clashes, and the protection of millions through vaccination. Shehu identified Buhari’s biggest achievement as puncture of the belief that Presidents of Nigeria use the office to enrich themselves. The statement said the “wicked spell is broken for good”, though politicians in some quarters remain offended. “They have witnessed how, when the state owes to them nothing, it provides for the people”, it added.
