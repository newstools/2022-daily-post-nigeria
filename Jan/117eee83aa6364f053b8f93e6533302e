The group said the name of the new State has already been chosen as Aba State and would be submitted to the President soon. President Buhari had yesterday revealed one of his problems with the people of the South Eastern region of the country. Appearing in an interview on Channels TV where he spoke on pressing national issues, Buhari pointed to the issue of State creation by South East leaders. Buhari explained that some leaders from the region approached him and demanded the creation of one more State to give the region an equal number of states like the other geographical zones. According to Buhari, he gave them the assignment to go and look at the map and see how many of the existing states will contribute to the new one and lamented that since the meeting the leaders never returned. But in a statement signed by Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, its Secretary-General, Ohanaeze Ndigbo said it wished to “notify President Buhari that the issue of state creation had been decided and will be presented to the President through the official channels. “Ndigbo has agreed that Aba State is the most viable state amongst others based on the Ohanaeze committee on state creation and had been submitted it to the presidency and Igbo leadership had followed the laid down procedures and arrived that the creation of Aba state is the desired aspirations of Ndigbo”.
