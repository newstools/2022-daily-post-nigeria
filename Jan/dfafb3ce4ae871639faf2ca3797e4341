Anthony Martial is hopeful that his loan move to Sevilla from Manchester United will see him enjoy playing football again. The 26-year-old has taken a wage cut to complete a move to the LaLiga outfit this week. “It’s not just about money. It’s to play and to enjoy it. That’s why I chose to come here, to play and to enjoy football again,” Martial said. The France forward only made 11 appearances in all competitions for United this season. He added: “I want to score goals, provide assists and be crucial for this team in the next five months. “There are many good players at Sevilla and I want to bring my experience to the side.” Sevilla are currently second in LaLiga and are in contention for their seventh Europa League crown.
