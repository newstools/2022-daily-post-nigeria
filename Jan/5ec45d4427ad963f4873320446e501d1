A chieftain of the Igbo socio-political organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chuks Ibegbu has accused Bola Tinubu, a presidential aspirant, of committing a political sin against Nigeria. Ibegbu, the immediate past Deputy Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze, said Tinubu committed sin by hoisting hardship on Nigerians in 2015. In a chat with DAILY POST, Ibegbu said Tinubu aided a clueless leader into power in Nigeria. According to Ibegbu: “Bola Tinubu foisted a political harakiri on Nigerians in 2015 which has now turned to economic turpsy turvy and incalculable hardship on Nigerians. “I’m furious at the state of affairs in Nigeria today and I blame Tinubu for aiding and abetting it by foisting gerontocrats and clueless rulers on Nigerians.” He also urged the former Lagos State Governor to apologize to Nigerians for aiding and bringing about suffering in the country. “Tinubu should apologize to Nigerians for that tragic decision which we are still suffering. “Tinubu should also rethink about his decision to contest for the Presidency in 2023 to avoid being disgraced at the primaries and polls,” he added. The All Progressives Congress, APC, National Leader, on Monday, informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his intention to run for the presidency in 2023. He disclosed that becoming Nigeria’s President has been his life- long aspiration.
