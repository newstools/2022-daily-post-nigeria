Former Manchester United star, Paul Parker has told the club to spend the cash on England midfielder Declan Rice. Parker is recommending the player because he has Premier League experience, adding that the club does not need to sign a player from another league. According to him, Manchester United are capable of signing Rice, who is worth £100m, for £160m and also provide him with whatever he wants. He described the current midfield setting at United comprising of Nemanja Matic, Fred, Scott McTominay, Bruno Fernandes and the injured Paul Pogba as embarrassing. “Manchester United at the moment are shopping in a bargain basement,” He was quoted to have said by Metro. “For Declan Rice, if he’s [worth] £100m, spend £160m. Give him what he wants and what happens is that he takes your team to another level. “Because Manchester United’s [current] midfield is an embarrassment to the club. “Get players without leaving your shores and you know that they can play in your league. There’s no qualms about, as Sky do, difficulty in adapting to the Premier League. It’s not. “Good players adapt to football. No worries about these players. They’ve proved themselves already and you go out and get them.”
