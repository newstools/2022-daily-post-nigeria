Former Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper, Paul Robinson has warned Newcastle United against signing Super Eagles striker, Odion Ighalo. According to him, it is a massive risk for the relegation-battling club to sign Ighalo, who he described as an unreliable player. Igalo, a former Watford and Manchester United striker has been heavily linked with a return to the Premier League and tipped to help Newcastle stave off relegation this season. Robinson believes the Magpies would be taking a massive risk bringing the Nigeria international to King James’ Park this January transfer window. “I think he’d be a massive risk. He is unreliable and I don’t think Newcastle are in a position where they can take risks,” he told Football Insider. “Financially, they are in a position where they can go and get a top quality striker who is less of a risk than he is. “It’s definitely a position they need to address though given that Wilson is out. To stay up they’ll need a striker to be scoring regularly. “I just don’t think Ighalo is the player they are looking for.”
