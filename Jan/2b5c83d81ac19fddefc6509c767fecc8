Femi Fani-Kayode, former Aviation Minister, has expressed the belief that Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State will defeat Atiku Abubakar, ex-Peoples Democratic Party, presidential candidate, in 2023 if the duo contested. Fani-Kayode claimed Bello would make an excellent president because the governor would appeal to youths in the country. He made the remark while speaking with Channels Television on Friday. Asked if the Kogi Governor could defeat Atiku during the presidential election in 2023, Fani-Kayode said: “Why not? He will defeat him hands down. “I believe Governor Yahaya Bello. I believe that he will be an excellent president. I believe he will appeal to millions of young people in this country and that this is a change in the dynamics we are giving power to a younger person. That is just my view though. “There is nobody else on that list, particularly Atiku Abubakar, that can stand against anybody within the APC, particularly against Yahaya Bello, Fashola or Fayemi. That is just my view, and I have my reason for saying that.” There are speculations that Bello would run for the Presidency in 2023. Bello’s presidential campaign posters have been sighted in some states following the speculations. However, Bello has yet to officially declare his interest in running for the Presidency in 2023.
