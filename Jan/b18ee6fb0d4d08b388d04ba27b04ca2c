Manchester United have listed three conditions to Newcastle, if they want to take Jesse Lingard on a six-month loan in January, the UK Mirror reports. Lingard will be a free agent in the summer, but the Red Devils want to get as much as possible for the forward, if he is leaving in the winter window. As well as a loan fee of around £6million, United want the Toon to cover Lingard’s £100,000-a-week wages for the rest of the season, as well as a bonus payment if they stay up. That figure is understood to be around the £12m mark, taking the overall package to around £19.6m. Premier League survival is worth at least £100m to Newcastle, who are currently 18th, one point from safety. If Lingard performs as well as he did on loan at West Ham last season, when he scored nine goals, the Toon are likely to stay up.
