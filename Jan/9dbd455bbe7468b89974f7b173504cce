Sudan national team head coach, Burhan Tia has said that his team will approach their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, tie against Nigeria with a balance between defense and attack. Sudan will face the Super Eagles in their second AFCON fixture at the Roumdé Adjia Stadium, Garoua, on Saturday evening. The Falcons of Jediane head to the game after playing a 0-0 draw against Guinea-Bissau in their first game on Tuesday. Nigeria, meanwhile, defeated Egypt 1-0, thanks to Kelechi Iheanacho’s first-half goal. “We play with a great team [Nigeria] with high-level stars, but we will play with a balance between defense and attack,” Tia told CAF’s official website. “The absence of Mohamed Abdel Rahman is impressive, but we have a number of young players waiting for an opportunity to appear.” Sudan are in Group D alongside Nigeria, Egypt and Guinea-Bissau. The kick-off time for Nigeria vs Sudan is 5 pm, Nigerian time.
