Nigeria’s Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami said court sittings in Kainji, New Bussa, Niger State, for prosecution of Boko Haram cases, would resume soon. Malami made the announcement on Tuesday while receiving the Ambassador to the Netherlands, Eniola Ajayi. The Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) hailed the envoy for her efforts and patriotism. He said Nigeria cooperated with the International Criminal Court (ICC) which eventually led to its exoneration. “With due diligence to Nigeria’s mandate under Article 86 of the Rome Statute of ICC, Nigeria cooperated fully with the court through submission of relevant documents, reports of panels of enquiry etc,” he said. Malami confirmed that a committee has been established for the domestication of the Rome Statute in Nigeria. Speaking, Ajayi promised to continue her service in the interest of the nation and rededicate efforts to make a positive impact.
