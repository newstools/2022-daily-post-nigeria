Head coach of Guinea-Bissau, Baciro Cande has claimed every top team has a weak side ahead of their final Group D clash against Nigeria at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. The Super Eagles have already qualified as group winners, but Cande’s men only have one point from two games. They will be looking to upset the three-time African champions, in a bid to clinch one of the four spots for the best third-place countries in the Round of 16. “Nigeria is one of the best teams in Africa. A very strong side. We will play our game and hope that Nigeria makes a mistake, some errors and maybe luck will smile on us. “We know that no matter how strong a team is, there is always a weak side and we hope to capitalize on that,” Cande said. The game will be played simultaneously with Egypt vs Sudan from 8pm (WAT).
