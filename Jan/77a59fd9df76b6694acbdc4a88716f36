Roma manager, Jose Mourinho has turned down an approach from Everton and insists he is happy in Italy. The Toffees sacked Rafa Benitez last week and were considering Mourinho as a replacement. An official approach has yet to be made, but Everton owner Farhad Moshiri is contemplating the prospect of bringing the former Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham boss to Goodison Park. However, Sky Sports News reports Mourinho wants to stay in the Italian capital and remains committed to Roma. Mourinho is only six months into a three-year contract with the Serie A side. Frank Lampard and Wayne Rooney remain top contenders for the position.
