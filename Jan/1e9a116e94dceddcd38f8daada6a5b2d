The Ooni Ife, Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi Ojaja II, has condoled with the Yoruba race over the demise of the Oluban of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Akanmu Adetunji Ogunguniso on Sunday morning. Ooni Ogunwusi, in a statement through his Director of Media and Public Affairs, Moses Olafare, described the late Oba as a great monarch whose reign would forever be remembered for the tremendous development brought to Ibadan land in particular and Nigeria at large. According to the first-class monarch, “Kabiyesi Olubadan did not let the features of old age hold him back during his lifetime as he was active to projects, programmes, plans and other activities towards making life better for his subjects. That is why his return home would be missed greatly by all. “Though it is a tough way to start the year, we must submit to the will of the Almighty God for the life of Oba Adetunji which was well-spent serving humanity. “Our thoughts and prayers are with natives as well as residents of the ancient city of Ibadan and the entire Yoruba race globally at this material time, ” the Ooni said. The Ooni had, in December 2021, described the Soun of Ogbomoso, Oba Oladunni Oyewumi, Ajagungbade III and the Olowu of Owu, Oba Adegboyega Dosunmu, who recently joined their ancestors as monarchs who added value to the Yoruba race. Ooni Ogunwusi explained that the trio of Soun, Olowu and Olubadan led their people to growth and all-round development during their reigns. He added that history will forever be kind to them across the Yoruba race.
