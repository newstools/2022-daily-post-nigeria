Azeez Adekunle Lawal a.k.a. Kunle Poly will remain in the custody of the Nigeria Police Zonal Monitoring Unit, Zone 2 Headquarters in Onikan, Lagos. A Yaba Chief Magistrate’s Court ruled on Thursday in the case against him and other National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) chieftains. Chief Magistrate Linda Balogun remanded Lawal, Prince Idowu Onikoyi Johnson and Agboola Akeem Kosoko. A riot broke out last week in Lagos Island areas including Balogun, Kosoko Martins, Idumota, Oluwole. A number of persons were injured and business activities paralyzed. One person died in the bloody fracas which lasted two days. Balogun ordered the remand of the defendants after an application by Police counsel, Morufu Animashaun. The lawyer cited Sections 264(1), (2), (3), (4) and (6) of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law of Lagos State, 2021 (as amended); Section 4 and 10 of the Police Act, 2020, and Sections 6(c), 35(1)(C)(5) and (7)(a) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended). The police are investigating the trio for threat to life and property, violence, cultism, mayhem, breach of peace, unlawful possession of firearms, conspiracy and murder. Animashaun supported the remand application with a 14-paragraph affidavit, deposed to by Inspector Monday Ohion. Magistrate Balogun said she found merit in the application and granted it. “The three defendants are to be remanded in the facility of the Nigeria Police Zonal Monitoring Unit, Zone 2 Headquarters, Onikan-Lagos, for the next 30 days, to enable the police to conclude investigation’’, she ruled.
