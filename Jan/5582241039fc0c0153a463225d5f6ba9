A fruit seller has been murdered in Ondo State by assailants suspected to be Fulani herders. The victim identified as Mrs Roseline Joguntan was said to have been gang-raped on a farm in Igbokoda in Ilaje Local Government Area of the State before she was killed. Late Mrs Joguntan, a middle-aged woman had gone to her family farm over the weekend in the zion axis of the community when the incident happened. A source said the deceased who went to the farm with her daughter had gathered produce which she asked her daughter to take home. Her daughter was said to have noticed her mother was missing when she returned to the farm, after which her body was found in the bush. Following the discovery of her body on the farm, the husband of the deceased, Mr Joguntan reported the case at the police station. The Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, of the State Command Funmilayo Odunlami, said when the deceased’s husband could not reach her on phone, he went to the farm to check on her where he found her lifeless body in the pool of blood. Meanwhile, some residents of the community have alleged that the assailants are herdsmen who they said had dominated the area to carry out various crimes. It was alleged that no sooner than the incident happened, some herdsmen were seen vacating the town en masse. Also speaking on the incident, the Public Relations Officer, PRO, Ilaje Security Council, Prince Emorioloye Owolemi, urged the state government and security agencies in the state to come to their rescue in Igbokoda. Owolemi lamented that the killings were becoming rampant in the local government. Meanwhile, the corpse of the deceased had been deposited in the morgue by the police.
