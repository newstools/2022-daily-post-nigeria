The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has said citizens do not need to engage in petrol panic buy. The state-owned company assured of sufficient Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) to meet the needs of the public. Garba Muhammad, Public Affairs General Manager, gave the assurance in a statement on Wednesday. The spokesman advised Nigerians to ignore rumours that suggest scarcity across the country. “In line with the existing laws of the land, NNPC Ltd. is deeply committed to ensuring energy security for the country”, he noted. Also on Wednesday, the NNPC presented a bill of N3trillion for deliberations at the Federal Executive Council (FEC). The meeting was presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari. Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, said the amount is required to continue to subsidise petroleum products for the approved 18 months extension.
