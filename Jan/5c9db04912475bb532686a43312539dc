There are speculations on social media about the “death” of former Head of State, Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (IBB). Information circulated at the weekend that the Niger-born retired General passed away. Citing a source Sunday night, PRNigeria reported that IBB is “alive and hearty”. Insider insists the former Nigerian leader is doing well despite some restrictions due to health reasons. “Gen. Babangida, this afternoon, had a sort of meeting and political consultations with some friends and politicians who visited his Hill Top residence”, the source said. 80-year-old IBB recently received former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu, at his residence in Minna. The All Progressives Congress (APC) national leader explained that the trip was about the security challenges in Niger and his presidential ambition. “I can’t stop by without paying a courtesy call to the enigma, General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, retired”. “He gave me his prayers. You want to know the outcome of the consultation? We are running a democracy”, Tinubu told reporters.
