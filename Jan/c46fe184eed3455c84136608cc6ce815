Super Eagles interim boss, Augustine Eguavoen, has expressed happiness after winning the Group Stage Best Coach award at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) 2021 in Cameroon. The Confederation of African Football (CAF) had earlier on Saturday named Eguavoen as the Group Stage Best Coach at the ongoing AFCON. Eguavoen led Nigeria to three straight victories against Egypt, Sudan and Guinea-Bissau in Group D. In doing so, the 56-year-old, who won the AFCON 1994 edition as a player, equalled his own record set in 2006 as a coach. Eguavoen only replaced Gernot Rohr on a temporary basis, barely two weeks before the tournament kicked off. Reacting, Eguavoen, in a tweet via his Twitter handle ahead of Nigeria’s AFCON last-16 tie with Tunisia on Sunday, said: “Many thanks to the Confederation of African Football for this award. “The Best coach of the Group stage. It wouldn’t have been possible without my fantastic group of players and colleagues. “Thank you, Nigerians, for your support. It’s needed now, more than ever.”
