Arsenal’s assistant manager, Albert Stuivenberg, has admitted that defender, Gabriel, needed to be ‘smarter’ after being sent off during his side’s Premier League 2-1 defeat to Manchester City on New Year’s Day. Stuivenberg, who took charge of Arsenal team after the club’s manager Mikel Arteta tested positive for COVID-19, said this during his post-match press conference after Man City defeated Arsenal at Emirates. Gabriel was then sent off for a second yellow card during the encounter as two goals from Riyad Mahrez and Rodri ensured Man City defeated Arsenal. “We are very frustrated with the outcome if you play a game like this against one of the best teams in the world,” Stuivenberg said at his post-match press conference. “At the end to have zero points is frustrating because we should have won the game. “It’s something we have to learn, we have young players in the team and have to control our emotions. If you are a yellow, you have to be smarter.” “A lot of positives and we have to build from here, this is the level we have to play,” he added. “Everyday we work hard to create this situation.” Arsenal will now hope to return to winning ways when they host Liverpool in the EFL semi-final tie on Thursday.
