Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola has described Chief Ernest Shonekan as a leader who will be long remembered for his courage, selfless and patriotic service to the country at a very challenging time. Governor Oyetola also described Chief Shonekan as an elder statesman and industrialist whose exceptional qualities in and out of office demonstrated strong commitment to the peace, unity and development of Nigeria. The Governor made this known in a condolence statement signed and made available to DAILY POST by Ismail Omipidan, his Chief Press Secretary on Tuesday. While noting that he received the news of the demise of the former head of the Interim National Government with sadness, the Osun helmsman added that his demise had created a gap that would take long to close. In his words, “On behalf of my family, government and people of Osun, I commiserate with the wife of Chief Ernest Shonekan, his family, government and people of Ogun State. “I pray God grant the soul of Chief Shonekan eternal rest and give his beloved wife, family and the people of Ogun State the fortitude to bear his loss.” Chief Ernest Shonekan, who died on Tuesday morning in Lagos, was a former Chairman of UAC Plc. He was head of the Interim National Government of Nigeria between August 26 and November 17, 1993 when he was overthrown by General Sani Abacha.
