Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Friday expressed optimism that he would emerge victorious over the terrorism charges leveled against him by the Nigerian Government. Kanu expressed hope that his current trial at the Abuja Federal High Court would end soon. The pro-Biafra agitator is facing terrorism charges before Justice Binta Nyako-led Federal High Court in Abuja. The Nigerian Government leveled the charges against Kanu following his re-arrest and repatriation from Kenya. He was nabbed in Kenya over his agitation for the actualization of Biafra and Nigeria’s breakup by extension. However, the IPOB leader stated that his current travel would only last for a while. Kanu spoke during his routine meeting with his counsel, Ifeanyi Ejiofor, at the Department of State Services, DSS, Headquarters in Abuja. In a statement made public by Ejiofor, the pro-Biafra agitator urged his followers to be peaceful and avoid distraction. The statement reads partly: “Kanu deeply appeals to Umu Chineke to avail themselves of the peace initiative presently ongoing and not to be distracted anymore. He further implored all Umu Chineke to keep their eyes on the ball because enemies are struggling in vain to entrench disharmony. “Onyendu reiterates that the ongoing interventions towards peaceful coexistence must be respected, encouraged and abided by. His call for unity among the entire Umu Chineke at all levels, who believe in his peaceful message cannot be overemphasised. “Further, Onyendu extends his warm regards to millions of his fans and followers who have equally remained consistently, resolute, and focused. He is convinced that the present situation will only last a while, and he will emerge victoriously.”
