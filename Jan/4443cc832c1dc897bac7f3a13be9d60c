Justice Daniel Osiagor of a Federal High Court in Lagos has found a comedian, Joshua Sunday a.k.a. De General guilty of drug trafficking. The social media influencer was arraigned by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) alongside Caleb William, a cinematographer. The judge held that the volume of substance was minimal and would convict and caution the defendants, rather than a sentence. NAN reports that Justice Osiagor convicted Sunday and William and warned them to “go and sin no more”. Charged with three counts of trafficking Tramadol and Cannabis Sativa, they pleaded guilty. Lilian Omotunde was the defence lawyer. The duo told the court they never tasted drugs and that the substances were props for a skit they were about to shoot before their arrest. The prosecutor, Jeremiah Aernan, reviewed the facts of the case and tendered evidence through an NDLEA exhibit keeper, Lucky Oghaifu. These include the defendants’ statements, drug analysis form, certificate of test analysis, request for scientific aid form and packaging of substance form. Aernan said agents made the arrest on January 12 in the Lekki area of Lagos due to unlawful possession of 15g of Cannabis and 14 g of tramadol. The offence contravenes the provision of Section 11(c) of the NDLEA Act, Cap N30, Laws of the Federation, 2004.
