Niger State Government has confirmed the attack on Ukuru community in Bobi, Mariga Local Government Area by terrorists in the area on Wednesday, where unspecified number of persons lost their lives. Confirming the incident to newsmen in Minna, the Commissioner for Information, Alhaji Mohammed Sani Idris, said aside those killed, many houses and vehicles were set on fire by the terrorists. He also explained that the bandits who were destroying anything on their way, were those fleeing from the ongoing military operations in Kaduna, Zamfara, Kebbi and Sokoto states. “The terrorists don’t want to kidnap many people because it will be a burden on them as they try to escape. Government will not be daunted by their activities.” However, Idris stated that details on the incident would be made available at the appropriate time as the state government was still awaiting details. Also, eyewitness’ accounts stated that the terrorists stormed the area in their number with three persons on each motorcycle in possession of AK-47 rifles and abducted many villagers. It was gathered that their first point of attack were the stalls where traders had gathered their goods in Ukuru Market for sale before the actual market day (Thursday). Many of the goods, it was further learnt, were carted away by the gunmen while the remaining ones were set ablaze in the stalls.
