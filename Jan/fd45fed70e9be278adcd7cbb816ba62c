The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has insisted it set no target for Super Eagles interim coach, Augustine Eguavoen, at the ongoing 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. Eguavoen was taken on the role in December following Gernot Rohr’s sack after five years. However, before the AFCON kicked off, Portuguese tactician Jose Peseiro was appointed as the new permanent manager. Following victories over Egypt and Sudan, the Super Eagles have booked a place in the Round of 16. “He is on an interim basis, he has just been handed the mandate to do his very best, and we know what his very best is. “Sixteen years ago, he led the team to a bronze medal in Egypt and of course, he is the coach with the highest percentage of wins in matches for Nigeria – 12 wins in 14 games over three stints is not something to sneeze at. “So, we [NFF] believe that we will go all the way to lead the team to the final,” NFF spokesman, Ademola Olajire, told Goal.
