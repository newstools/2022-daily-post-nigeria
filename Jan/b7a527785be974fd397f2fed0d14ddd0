Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, on Saturday, stated that informants have frustrated all the efforts to rid the state of banditry and criminals in the state. Governor El-Rufai, while speaking at the Armed Forces Remembrance Day celebration in Kaduna on Saturday, noted that informants living within communities in the state have been frustrating the fight against banditry. According to him, “The level of insecurity we face in the country, especially here in Kaduna State, is of great concern and I think that the security agencies, especially the military and the police are doing their best but we need every stakeholder in order to contribute; because the biggest problem we have are the informants that live within us. According to him, it is important for religious and community leaders not only to raise their advocacy, but to also watch out for people that seem to be spending a lot of money without any clear means of livelihood, adding that they are probably informants of kidnappers. He said such people should be reported to the authorities nearest to them, assuring that the government will protect such information and take all necessary action. He expressed appreciation to the Armed Forces and the police, who are losing officers and men daily to the war against banditry and assured them of government’s support not only in resources, but in prayers.
