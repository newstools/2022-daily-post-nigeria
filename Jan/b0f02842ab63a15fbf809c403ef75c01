Augustine Eguavoen has revealed what striker, Sadiq Umar told him about being selfish in front of goal. Eguavoen said the Almeria frontman told him that as a striker, he first thinks about scoring before considering giving assists to his teammates. Appearing before the press ahead of Super Eagles’ round of 16 clash with Tunisia on Sunday evening, Eguavoen said he has tried to let the Olympic Bronze medalist understand that it should rather be a team work. Eguavoen, a 1994 AFCON winner, was asked why he had a lengthy conversation with Sadiq during one of the team’s training sessions ahead of Tunisia clash “He also told me that as a striker first thing in his mind is to score goals, I said that’s an instinct, that’s normal but it’s the team,” he said. Speaking further, the coach said he advised the Spain-based striker to score whenever he has the chance to do so, adding, “don’t let what other people are talking about you bother you”. Sadiq scored the opener for Nigeria against Guinea-Bissau in their last Group D game on Wednesday.
