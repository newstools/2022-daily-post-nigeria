A baby boy was found in the bin of an Air Mauritius plane’s toilet. The mother, a 20-year-old woman from Madagascar, suspected to have delivered during the flight is in custody. The aircraft flew from Madagascar and landed at Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport on January 1, 2022. BBC reports that airport officers discovered the newborn during a routine customs check. The infant was rushed to a public health facility for treatment; he and the mum are well. After an initial denial of the boy, a medical examination confirmed that the woman just gave birth. She arrived in Mauritius on a two-year work permit and will be questioned after discharge from the hospital.
