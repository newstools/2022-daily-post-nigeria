AC Milan striker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic says he has already told Kylian Mbappe to leave Paris Saint-Germain immediately. The Sweden international said he told the French star to move to Real Madrid. Mbappe is yet to commit his future to either PSG or Real Madrid as his contract expires at the end of the season. Ibrahimovic revealed that Mbappe approached him for career advice and he told the former Monaco forward to leave Paris Saint-Germain for Real Madrid. Mbappe has been widely tipped to join Real Madrid and nearly made the move last summer. “Only Kylian can answer you about where he has to go. It depends on what he wants, what he thinks,” Ibrahimovic told L’Equipe. “Me, I would have gone. But if I am PSG, I would try to keep him. It’s him who will decide. PSG want to keep him, obviously, but does he want to stay? “He asked me, yes, and I told him: ‘If I were you, I would go to Real’. Zlatan is of the opinion that remaining in his homeland all his career would not afford the player the needed experience he requires to grow as a top footballer. He advised the France international to be adventurous by packing his bags and going to other places. Real Madrid are hopeful that Kylian Mbappe would join them for free next summer when his contract ends at Paris Saint-Germain. Mbappe has scored 11 goals in 20 match days in the season and this places him in top 3 in highest goals scorers’ chat in the Ligue 1 so far.
