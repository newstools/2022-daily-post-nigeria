Liverpool legend, Jamie Carragher has highlighted major reasons his old club won’t win the Premier League title this season. Carragher pointed to Liverpool’s susceptibility to throwing away a lead, as they did against Chelsea on Sunday, where they surrendered a two-goal lead before half-time as one of the reasons. Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah fired the visitors into a 2-0 lead but the Reds could not sustain the lead as Mateo Kovacic and Christian Pulisic levelled for the home side before half-time. The match ended with that scoreline as none of the teams were able to score more goals in the second half, with both goalkeepers producing outstanding performances. While Chelsea are now 10 points behind league leaders, Manchester City, Liverpool are 11 points behind Pep Guardiola’s high-flying City, who whipped Arsenal 2-1 on Saturday. “When you’re 2-0 up against one of your big rivals, you’ve got to be disappointed,” Carragher told Sky Sports. “But that’s why Liverpool won’t win the league this season. Liverpool have taken the lead 17 times this season and so have Manchester City, but City have won each game. Liverpool have only won 12. “What Liverpool are lacking now that they had in the title-winning season is control of a football game. What we’re watching here today and what we watched at Tottenham [a 2-2 draw] was Jurgen Klopp in years one and two. “That was the best game I’ve seen this season, but in terms of Liverpool winning the title, that’s what’s going to cost them. Five times now, they’ve taken the lead this season and they’ve not won the game. That’s the difference between Liverpool and Man City right now.”
