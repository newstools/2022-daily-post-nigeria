Technical Director of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Augustine Eguavoen, has said he will do all he can to help Jose Peseiro if he eventually takes charge of the national team. Eguavoen was the interim coach of the Super Eagles at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. He has since stepped down from the role after Nigeria were eliminated by Tunisia in the Round of 16. The ex-captain says he is prepared to back Peseiro to the hilt if the NFF decide to appoint the Portuguese ahead of the 2022 World Cup play-offs against Ghana. “He is coming to a foreign country. “We’ve been on ground and we have to work closely. We will give him everything to make him succeed because it is country first. “I will give him my report to study. “I will tell him the background, the culture, how we operate here. Our philosophy and our style of football, and he will bring his own and we will look at it together and map out strategies for how we can make the country progress. Just to make sure we make him very comfortable and then he has nothing to worry about but just to grind out results,” Eguavoen told ESPN.
