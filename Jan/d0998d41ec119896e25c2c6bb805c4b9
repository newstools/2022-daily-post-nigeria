Manchester United legend, Paul Scholes, has named Tottenham boss, Antonio Conte and Paris Saint-Germain’s Mauricio Pochettino as his top two choices to replace Ralf Rangnick as the club’s manager. Rangnick was appointed on an interim basis to replace Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as United boss in November following a series of poor results. As many pundits could rightly claim, nothing has changed since the intervention was made, with United suffering a disappointing defeat at home to Wolves earlier in the month. Scholes questioned the decision of the club’s head to appoint Rangnick, saying it is ‘astonishing’ that a manager with so few trophies is in charge at Old Trafford. Asked who he views as the ideal replacement for Rangnick, United legend Scholes told the Webby & O’Neill YouTube channel: “Conte at Tottenham or Pochettino. I think one of those is the manager we want. “We know that Conte is up there with [Pep] Guardiola, [Jurgen] Klopp and [Thomas] Tuchel. We know that that’s a given. ‘So I think Man United should be looking for someone like that. Tottenham fans won’t like me saying it, but I think they could probably still get him [in the summer]. “I think Pochettino is a brilliant manager, I love what he does and I love what he did at Tottenham.”
