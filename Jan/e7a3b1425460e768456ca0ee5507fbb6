Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State on Monday said he is not against anyone defecting from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP to the All Progressives Congress, APC in the state. The governor stated this at the Benue Peoples House in Makurdi, during a meeting with members of the PDP from Gwer West Local Government Area of the state. He, however, insisted that no right-thinking person will contemplate joining a sinking party, the All Progressives Congress, APC for whatever reason. The Governor thanked the people of Gwer West for being solidly behind his administration and the PDP in general, stressing that the party is poised to win the presidency in 2023. Earlier, Special Adviser to the Governor on Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Ken Achabo, Felix Atume, Mrs Grace Igbabon and other speakers reaffirmed their support for the Governor and the PDP. Meanwhile, the PDP in Gwer West has suspended four persons including Prince Simon Aondoana and Chief Goddy Ikyereve for anti-party activities. The decision was taken at a stakeholders meeting of the party from Gwer West held in Makurdi, the State capital.
