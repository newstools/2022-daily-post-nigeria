Cameroon have become the first country to qualify for the knockout stages of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. The hosts beat Ethiopia 4-1 on Thursday evening to seal their spot. Captain Vincent Aboubakar and Karl Toko-Ekambi both scored twice to take the Indomitable Lions through with one group game to spare. Cameroon had defeated Burkina Faso 2-1 last Sunday in their opening fixture. But they had to come back from behind at the Olembe Stadium in Yaounde, after Dawa Hotessa gave Ethiopia a shock lead. The five-time African champions are now well-placed to finish top of Group A. Their last group game is against Cape Verde, while Burkina Faso take on Ethiopia.
