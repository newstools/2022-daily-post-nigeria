Super Eagles defender, Leon Balogun, has told interim manager, Augustine Eguavoen, the best position for Joe Aribo in Nigeria’s squad. Eguavoen deployed Aribo as one of the two holding midfielders in Nigeria’s first two 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) games against Egypt and Sudan. But Balogun, a teammate of Aribo’s at the club level wants Eguavoen to deploy the 25-year-old in the number 10 role for the Super Eagles going forward. “I have always known he’s a great player, right from the time I started playing with him. He’s in great form this season and he managed to bring that to Nigeria in the last two games,” Balogun said in an Instagram Live video. “To me, he’s not playing in his best position. If you put him in as a No.10, he will give you more joy because he knows how to take on players, he knows how to delay the play in a way. “However, I’m happy he’s found a way to bring his form to the national team because I think people have been waiting for long, for him to actually replicate the kind of form he has at club level. “So, “I’ m actually happy he’s found a way to do it in a different position.” Nigeria’s next 2021 AFCON tie is against Guinea-Bissau on Wednesday.
