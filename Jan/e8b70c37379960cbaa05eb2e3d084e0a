Confederation of African Football (CAF) has confirmed that three 2021 Africa Cup of Nations fixtures will be moved from the Japoma Stadium in Douala to Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium in Yaounde. Two quarter-finals and the February 2 semi-final matches are the games affected. The decision was taken because of concerns over the state of the pitch in Douala, CAF said in a statement on Wednesday. CAF president, Patrice Motsepe, had announced on Tuesday that the quarter-final due to be played at the Olembe Stadium in Yaounde will be switched to the Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium after a deadly crush that killed eight people. It was then confirmed on Wednesday, after Motsepe hosted a meeting with tournament organisers. “The next match that was scheduled for the Olembe Stadium will not take place until CAF and the Local Organising Committee have received the full report of the Investigation Committee (into the Olembe incident) indicating the circumstances and events that led to the injury and death of spectators at the Olembe Stadium,” CAF said in a statement. The second semi-final, to be played February 3, is still scheduled at Olembe Stadium for the time being.
