Father Ejike Mbaka, the Spiritual Director, Adoration Ministry Enugu, has begged priests to stop condemning him for praying for the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu. Mbaka who made the appeal in his 2022 New Year message said “he’s not closing any priest’s mouth and nobody should close his”. The clergyman challenged other priests to curse Kanu if
they do not appreciate the prayers he offers on his behalf, arguing that people do not understand the spiritual authority he has over the land. Mbaka further claimed that Nnamdi Kanu is his son and that he will keep praying for Nnamdi Kanu and everyone held for agitations. He prayed that God will show them mercy. ”I’m begging my fellow priests to stop condemning me for praying for Nnamdi Kanu. I am not closing any priest’s mouth and nobody should close my own. If I use my mouth to bless Nnamdi Kanu and you don’t like it, please use your own mouth to curse him. Leave me to bless him. ”Every Igbo man and woman is my child. “If as a church, we can be praying for Nigeria in distress, nobody can stop us from praying for Nnamdi Kanu and our brothers in distress.
