Manchester United forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, would prefer former Barcelona boss, Luis Enrique, to become the club’s next permanent manager. Ralf Rangnick was named as interim boss after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was dismissed in November. The German is on a six-month contract, with a long-term successor yet to be named. According to The Athletic, United’s football director John Murtough has already drawn up a four-man shortlist. It is believed the names on the list include: Erik ten Hag, Mauricio Pochettino, Julen Lopetegui and Luis Enrique. Ronaldo has identified Enrique as the man he believes would be best suited to take the club forward. While at Real Madrid, Ronaldo came up against Enrique’s Barcelona side which won the treble in 2015.
