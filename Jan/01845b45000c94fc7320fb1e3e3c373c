A member of the House of Representatives and a chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) from Plateau State, Hon. Yusuf Gagdi, has said he and his supporters are waiting for Governor Simon Lalong to give them a direction on who to support for the governorship of the state in 2023. He also said Lalong, who is the leader of the APC in the state and northern Nigeria, is in a better position to choose a candidate to succeed him after due consultation. DAILYPOST reports that since the return of democratic structures in 1999, no outgoing governor in the state has installed his successor. “I say this without any political misrepresentation, Governor Lalong is the leader of APC in Plateau State, and quote me anywhere, he is the leader of APC in Northern Nigeria, for being the chairman of Northern Governors Forum,” Gagdi told newsmen in Jos. The legislator, who represents Pankshin/Kanke/Kanam constituency in the House of Representatives, added that “I equally realise as Governor of Plateau, he is a symbol of leadership in the state, and therefore anybody that is conscious of the development Plateau, who will not be separated from continuity, you will want the person at the helm of affairs to make consultation and to determine among the various interest groups he has interacted with. “What kind of character does he want, for the continuation of the APC programmes on the Plateau. “Therefore, as Governor Lalong’s ardent supporter, boy and his product; that I carried his bag when he was Speaker in State House of Assembly, worked with him when I was deputy speaker in the 8th State Assembly; I think the best thing for me is to wait for him to finish his consultation and give us direction. “And when he gives us direction, be rest assured that I Gagdi will be at the centre of it, and we will make sure, through the will of God, because we have a Governor who will determine who succeeds him come 2023.”
