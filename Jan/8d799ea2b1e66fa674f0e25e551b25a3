President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Prof George Obiozor, has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to show Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, mercy. Obiozor said Buhari should consider Kanu as his son and show him mercy. Featuring on Arise TV, Obiozor urged the president to grant the IPOB leader amnesty. The Ohanaeze President-General suggested that Buhari can stop Kanu’s case if he wants to. According to Obiozor: “The president said that the matter is in the court and you cannot fault it. “So, he is technically right in thinking that the case is already on. “We are asking for something different from the judiciary and we are asking for him to consider his prerogative of mercy, which is his own prerogative. “Also, the idea of treating him with mercy as a son and citizen, to be considerate and compassionate. “We are not talking about the judiciary. “If he is taking the judiciary route then he is taking the right route logically, but then away from what we are talking. “We are appealing for mercy and some form of amnesty.” Buhari had said he would not interfere with the ongoing trial of Kanu. Kanu is currently facing treason charges before the Justice Binta Nyako-led Federal High Court in Abuja. The IPOB leader is currently locked up by the Department of State Services, DSS, after he was apprehended in Kenya in 2021.
