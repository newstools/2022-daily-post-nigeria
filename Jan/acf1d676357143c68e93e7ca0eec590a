Residents of Hero’s Apartment, opposite Concorde Hotel, New Owerri, Imo State, were shocked in the early hours of Monday, when a mother, Mrs. Eziada Chika Mbachu, who was invited by his 38 years old son, name withheld, was attacked and inflicted with several knife cuts when his alleged plans to kill the woman for ritual purposes failed. One of the neighbours, who apprehended the suspected ritualist, told DAILYPOST that the woman who suspected foul play through the actions of the son, started screaming and raising the alarm, which prompted the people to come to her rescue. He said if not for the quick intervention of the neighbours who also suspected that the young man may be into Yahoo plus, the woman would have been dead by now. According to him, “The mother was shouting and calling for help with blood stains and wounds on her body. The woman’s cry attracted some neighbours who came to her rescue. When the son saw many people coming, he stopped attacking the mother.” The source said the bloodstains on the suspect’s mother also gave more insights into what may have transpired to create the suspicion of ritual killing-induced action. He said the woman has been rushed to the Federal Medical Centre, Owerri for treatment because of the knife cuts. The police have arrested the boy and taken him to the station.” The victim, Mrs. Mbachu, who is said to be a parishioner at Holy Trinity Catholic Parish at World Bank in Owerri, while reacting, thanked God and neighbours for saving her. She said “I thank God for rescuing me. I thank my neighbours for rescuing me. I thank everybody who came to my rescue. God in heaven, I say honour to your name.” DAILYPOST gathered that the police in New Owerri have taken over the matter. Meanwhile, the police spokesman in the state, Micheal Abattam, said he had not been briefed and promised to call the DPO of the area where the incident happened.
