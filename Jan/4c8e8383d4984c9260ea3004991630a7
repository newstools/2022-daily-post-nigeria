Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel has confirmed he will give his players two days off, following a 1-1 draw at Brighton. The Blues appear lethargic as they dropped more points in the title race at the Amex Stadium. Hakim Ziyech’s first-half strike was cancelled out by Adam Webster’s free header. Tuchel’s men have not won in their last four Premier League fixtures, drawing three, and missed the chance to go above Liverpool into second. “We need some days off, we have now two days off then two days to prepare for the next match at home against Tottenham. The boys need some days off, there is no other solution. “Look at our schedule when we arrived at Man City, we had the Carabao Cup in between, they did not. When we arrived here, they had more days to prepare. We’ve played like this since November, we are the team that plays and plays and plays. “We need to recharge the batteries and disconnect. That’s my feeling, that’s why I’ve given them two days off and then we will use Friday and Saturday to prepare for Sunday against Tottenham,” Tuchel said.
