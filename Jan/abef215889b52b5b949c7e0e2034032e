The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Monday, revealed why the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government is still holding its leader, Nnamdi Kanu in custody. IPOB’s spokesman, Emma Powerful, said the Federal Government was holding onto Kanu in a bid to infiltrate the group and destroy it from within. In a statement, Powerful said the Federal Government was annoyed with Kanu for refusing to accept monetary and property inducements. According to Powerful: “The attention of the global movement and family of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has been drawn to the secret plans by the Buhari government and his Fulani kinsmen to illegally detain our leader Nnamdi KANU for as long as possible. “Their annoyance with our leader is his blunt refusal to take properties and monetary inducement offered him to abandon the struggle for Biafra liberation. “The Federal Government decided to hold our leader indefinitely to see if it can possibly infiltrate the ranks of our great movement and destroy it from inside while our leader is in custody. “The federal government is also relying on the promise by some traitors and black sheep in America and Europe that they would assist it to realise the evil plot. The promise was made to the federal government during their secret visit to Aso Rock last December. “We are also aware that the Federal government has been lobbying the international community to enlist their support against Biafra liberation but they won’t succeed. Therefore, anybody distracting or causing division in the IPOB family is a tool knowingly or unknowingly working for the Federal Government of Nigeria. “The fact remains that Biafra is a divine project. It has gone beyond any single individual, including our leader. Millions of the oppressed Biafran youths home and abroad are now more aware and conscious than ever. It’s only a matter of time. Biafra MUST come. It can only be delayed but certainly not suppressed.”
