Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State has sworn in Justice Raheem Akanbi Shiyanbola as President of the state’s Customary Court of Appeal. The confirmation of Shiyanbola is sequel to the retirement of his predecessor, Justice Wasiu Akanbi, from service. During the swearing-in ceremony at the Local Government Service Commission, Osogbo, on Tuesday, Oyetola said the appointment is to ensure that the trust reposed in the judiciary as the last hope of the common man is sustained. Harping on the critical tenets of incorruptibility, fairness, integrity and fearlessness, the governor charged Justice Shiyanbola to uphold the sacred responsibilities of the leadership of the Customary Court of Appeal and ensure that justice is not only served but served in the interest of the people. “As you know, the Appellate Customary Court is a critical arm of the judiciary that must raise standards by giving justice to citizens denied the same at the lower courts. “In doing this, such critical tenets as incorruptibility, fairness, integrity, fearlessness, in dispensing justice to the people must never be compromised.
