A teenage boy in Adamawa State has bagged seven years in prison for snatching a handset valued at N60,000. The 18-year-old boy was found to be one of a crop of boys and young men infamously called Shila Boys in Adamawa State who are known for robberies, especially around the state capital, Yola The Shila Boy, Abubakar Mohammed, was on Friday convicted and sentenced to seven years in prison for extortion without option of fine. Abubakar, who is of Rumde ward in Yola North Local Government Area, was sentenced by Hon. Ibrahim Musa Ulenda of the Upper Area Court 4 sitting in Yola. The convict was last month arrested for extorting an infinix cell phone costing N60, 000 and belonging to one Himage Yayirus of Nyako Quarters in Yola North LGA. Court records indicate that the convict snatched Himage’s phone around Doubeli Junction, a T-junction in Doubeli area of Jimeta, Yola North. He was said to have run off into the bush along the Jimeta Bypass, but was unlucky to have run into someone who was defecating in the bush. When the man saw the boy being pursued by a mob towards him, he rose hurriedly and grabbed Abubakar. He was dragged to a nearby police divisional office in the heart of Doubeli, from where he was subsequently charged and arraigned in court by Sergeant Kabiru Abubakar of the Doubeli Police Station. He pleaded guilty in court to the charge of extortion, an offence which goes contrary to section 283 of the penal code law. After his plea, and following tendering of the phone he snatched which was admitted in evidence during trial, the prosecutor prayed the court to try him summarily. Delivering his judgement, Hon. Ibrahim Musa Ulenda convicted and sentenced Abubakar to seven years in prison without option of fine.
