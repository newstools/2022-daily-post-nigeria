A former Minister of Education, Oby Ezekwesili, has accepted an offer from the Governor-elect of Anambra State, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, to head his transition team. Ezekwesili confirmed this via her official Twitter page on Thursday night. “Governor-elect of our Anambra State Prof @CCSoludo wants a solid groundwork for his governance and has asked me to Chair his Transition Committee. “I have accepted and will team work with my distinguished colleagues to help achieve his transition goals and competent governance,” she wrote. DAILY POST recalls that Soludo, a former Central Bank of Nigeria Governor, won the November 2021 gubernatorial election in the state. Soludo, who contested on the platform of the All Progressives Grand Alliance party (APGA), defeated his closest rivals, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)’s Valentine Ozigbo and the All Progressive Congress (APC)’ Andy Uba.
