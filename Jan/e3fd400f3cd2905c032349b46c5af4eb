President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, has provided the latest update on his health situation after he was taken to the Vila Nova Star hospital in the South of Sao Paulo on Monday. Recall that Bolsonaro’s doctor, Antonio Luiz Macedo, had confirmed to the news website UOL from the Bahamas that the President was admitted to the hospital due to abdominal pain. Dr. Macedo said that Brazil’s number one citizen was under the tutelage of his team so far. “The President shall undergo more tests to find out what is in the abdomen. “We still don’t know, but it could be caused, for example, by poorly chewed food, among other factors,” Macedo said. Macedo also said that the suspicion, for now, is of a new intestinal obstruction, technically called “intestinal subocclusion. Reacting to the development, Bolsonaro, in a tweet via his Twitter account, said he was put in a nasogastric tube, adding that more tests will be done for possible surgery. He tweeted: “I started to feel sick after Sunday lunch. I arrived at the hospital at 3:00 am today. “They put me in a nasogastric tube. More tests will be done for possible surgery for internal obstruction in the abdominal region.”
