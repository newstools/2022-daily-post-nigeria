The Nigerian Governors’ Forum (NGF) on Thursday said it will engage the organised labour unions on the removal of fuel subsidy in the country. Governor Kayode Fayemi, NGF Chairman, made this known while briefing newsmen on Thursday in Abuja. Fayemi had said all governors met and discussed issues of national importance, including removal of subsidy and Electoral Amendment Bill and will enagage the leadership of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress on how best to address this issue without causing any disaffection. “So, we shall be engaging the NLC as sub-national leaders and with a view to ensure that the outcome of our engagement will also be fed into the national discourse,” Fayemi said. Speaking on what was the input of the NGF in the proposed price of N302/liter as price of petrol, Fayemi said the matter was not a decision of the governors but the exclusive responsibility of the Federal Government. He said that even though it was the responsibility of the National Economic Council, the governors were contributing to the debate. Fayemi also commended the Senate for accelerating the removal of the contentious clauses in the draft Electoral Amendment Bill. He expressed hope that the House of Representatives would follow suit, so that the revised electoral Bill could be returned to Mr President for assent on time. This, according to him, will enable the various institutions, particularly the Independent National Electoral Commission to proceed at pace with its responsibilities towards the various elections in 2022 and 2023.
