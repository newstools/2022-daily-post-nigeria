Former Governor of Kano State, Rabiu Kwankwaso, has dismissed speculations of him defecting from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to the All Progressives Congress, APC. Kwankwaso said he had no plan to dump the PDP for the APC, stressing that he is still committed to ensuring his party’s victory in 2023. Speaking with Channels Television Sunday night, the former governor admitted that there are issues regarding him in the PDP. He recalled how his supporters were unfairly treated during the party’s congress in Kaduna in 2021. Kwankwaso claimed that the PDP has not treated him well. According to Kwankwaso: “As we speak, there is no plan for me to leave the PDP, to join APC, or any other party. “There were issues which are very clear to almost everybody; that we had congress in April last year in Kaduna, which I felt and many of my supporters in the North-west and even beyond felt that I was not being treated well and Kano was not being treated the way it should be. “I believe that was the beginning of those issues to the extent that people thought because of that, we would leave the PDP for APC or any other party.” Kwankwaso speaks on dumping PDP for APC
