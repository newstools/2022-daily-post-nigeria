Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, is considering selling Romelu Lukaku. According to Catalan outlet El Nacional, Abramovich is still disappointed with how his record signing recently expressed his unhappiness at Chelsea. The report added that Lukaku has reportedly emerged as a target for Paris Saint-Germain as the French Ligue 1 giants look to sign a replacement for Kylian Mbappe. Mauricio Pochettino’s side are ready to tempt Lukaku to Paris with an offer of £75.5m as they look to replace Mbappe, who is widely expected to leave PSG for Real Madrid at the end of the season. Lukaku rejoined Chelsea from Inter Milan last summer for a club-record £97.5million. The Belgium international hit the headlines in recent weeks for voicing his frustration with his situation at Stamford Bridge in an explosive interview. The 28-year-old apologized to Chelsea fans on social media and has since featured twice for Thomas Tuchel’s side, scoring in their FA Cup 5-1 victory over Chesterfield on Sunday.
