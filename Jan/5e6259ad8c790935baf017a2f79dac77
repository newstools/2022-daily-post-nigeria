William Troost-Ekong has revealed that the Super Eagles will handle their next opponents, Sudan, same way they approached Egypt in their last game. Nigeria defeated Egypt 1-0 in their first game in the Group D on Tuesday with Kelechi Iheanacho finding the bottom corner in the 30th minute Ahead of their Saturday’s clash against Sudan, Troost-Ekong is urging Super Eagles teammates not to get carried away. “I don’t think we should believe in the hype. Every game for us is going to be a big game. We are going to approach it same way as we approached Egypt,” he told NAN. “Game by game we are going to try and get further and further so we’ll keep it cool, keep it humble, work hard and I think we’ve got all the things that we need to get a result on Saturday.”
