Arsenal striker, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, has said his “heart is absolutely fine” following medical checks in the UK. The 32-year-old recently flew back from the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations for medical examinations. Aubameyang was diagnosed with heart lesions following a positive COVID-19 test. Following the medical check-up, Aubameyang wrote on Instagram: “I came back to London to do some additional checks, and I’m very happy to say that my heart is absolutely fine and I’m completely healthy!! “Really appreciate all the messages over the last few days and I’m already back at it.” Aubameyang was given the all-clear after an MRI scan and an Electrocardiogram (ECG). It has yet to be decided whether the Gabon captain will return to Cameroon for the AFCON, with his country set to face Burkina Faso on Sunday in the last 16.
