Former Nigerian goalkeeper, Carl Ikeme has named Super Eagles star, Kelechi Iheanacho as Nigeria’s talisman at the ongoing 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, in Cameroon. Ikeme believes the Leicester City forward has the qualities to lead Nigeria to glory at the 2021 AFCON. Recall that Iheanacho scored the only goal in Nigeria’s 1-0 win against Egypt on Tuesday in Garoua. The win over Egypt means Austin Eguavoen’s side are on top of Group D with 3 points. When asked to pick a star player in the Super Eagles squad, the former Wolves goalkeeper told GOAL: “It is hard to look past Iheanacho. “He is going to be the talisman going forward in the tournament. Obviously, you can see from his quality last night with the goal. He’s a stand-out player. “I think if he does well in the tournament, Nigeria would do well too.” He added, “There was balance in the team, we looked solid at the back with Ndidi in the midfield. He really marshals the back and he controls the game well. “And we have Simon and Ihenancho going forward. We have got quality everywhere, we look strong, with some people calling us favourites already, but there are a couple of matches to go. “Simon is very quick and strong for the game so far, we look strong.”
