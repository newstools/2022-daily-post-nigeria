The Chairman of the Ekiti State Internal Revenue Service, Mr. Olumuyiwa Ogunmilade has called for proper control of the activities of Driving Schools and a review of their charges. Mr. Ogunmilade made the call during a meeting with representatives of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Vehicle Inspection Officer and the Driving School officials. Ogunmilade frowned at what he described as “exorbitant fees” charged by driving school operators for Driving School Certificates, warning that the development is affecting the revenue of the state, particularly on drivers’ licence. The IRS boss said available information indicated that many people now go to neighbouring states to process their driver’s licenses and other documents due to the favourable cost of processing such documents. Warning that the Government would soon clamp down on illegal driving schools as well as untrained and unlicensed driving instructors in the state, Ogunmilade stressed that the State Government would no longer tolerate quacks who masquerade as driving coaches and school instructors. He said fake schools and instructors would be smoked out and appropriate sanctions meted out on them which may include impounding their vehicles. In his remarks, the State Sector Commander of the FRSC, Mr. Ocheja Ameh who was represented by Mr. Bamidele Bejide, stressed the need for proper sensitization of the people to educate them on the importance of driving schools so that they embrace the process. Mr. Ameh said passport and data of prospective students of driving schools would henceforth be captured by the FRSC before they proceed to the driving school.
