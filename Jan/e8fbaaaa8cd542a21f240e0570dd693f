The Zamfara State Managing Director of the State Mass Transit, Alhaji Aminu Papa and members of his family were on Saturday night kidnapped at his residence at the Mareri area of Gusau, the State capital. DAILY POST gathered that there was a serious gun battle between the bandits and the local vigilante groups. This forced the kidnappers to release a member of the family but whisked away the Managing Director. “Yet, the vigilante groups still pursued the bandits; as a result of tension, they shot the MD on the foot and released him,” a source said.
