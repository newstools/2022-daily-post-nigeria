A former chairman of Daar Communications, Raymond Dokpesi, has said Nigeria’s next president must be someone who will unify the country. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain stated this at the party stakeholders’ meeting in Adamawa. Dokpesi noted that the country “has never been this disunited”, adding that Nigeria needs someone like ex-vice president, Atiku Abubakar, to lead the nation out of “its present quagmire”. He said: “Now that 2023 is approaching again. Now that the economy of the country has totally collapsed, and our children cannot find employment. “It is very glaring that we need somebody who is a unifier, who is very sound, who has business acumen, who himself has investment and wealth of experience and wherewithal to be able to properly lead the country out of its present quagmire like Atiku. “The country has never been disunited as we have it today, both on religious and ethnic lines. Our economy is in shambles. We have not borrowed as much money externally and locally as we have experienced in the last six or seven years of the APC-led federal government. “What we have under the Buhari administration is a Nigeria that is flowing with the blood of our children. The banditry and insecurity that is available is one which is unprecedented.” 2023: North should produce next president by PDP’s arrangement – Dokpesi
