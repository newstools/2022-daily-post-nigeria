Ambazonian activist, Ayaba Cho Lucas, has asked the Nigerian government to free Biafra agitator, Nnamdi Kanu. The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) leader is facing trial before Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court, Abuja. On Tuesday, Kanu refused to take plea in the 15 counts terrorism charges instituted by the federal government. The authorities filed fresh charges on Monday, a development Kanu’s lead counsel, Mike Ozekhome, opposed. The Senior Advocate of Nigeria accused the government of breaching the principle of fair hearing with the manner the new counts were brought forward. Ozekhome said the action was sixth in the series and that the defence needed time to study and prepare. Reacting to the legal battle, Ayaba described Kanu as “Biafra and Africa’s gift” and called for his release. “Nigeria’s Price. Biafra and Africa’s gift. This Generation will not Blink until all the systems of curtailment and anarchy are dismantled and buried in the dustbin of history. Free this man”, he tweeted. The ex-Southern Cameroons Youth League Secretary-General currently leads the Ambazonia Governing Council. In 2017, Ambazonia also known as Amba Land, was self-declared as a state in West Africa constituting the Northwest and Southwest regions of Cameroon.
