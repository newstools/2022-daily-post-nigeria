Orji Uzor Kalu, the Senate Chief Whip, on Sunday distanced himself from reports alleging that he attacked Bola Tinubu, a 2023 presidential aspirant. Kalu said his recent interview where he was reported to have said he would match Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, grit for grit was misconstrued. In a statement he issued in Abuja, the former Abia State Governor, said his comment was twisted to score cheap political goals, NAN reports. According to Kalu, he is not quarrelling with Tinubu or against his presidential ambition. Kalu said: “We can never attack Tinubu. “I told Nigerians that I will contest against Tinubu if the ticket is zoned to the South. APC is a democratic party that allows every qualified member to vote and be voted for. “It is not owned or managed by an individual. If I said I was going to contest against Tinubu, it doesn’t mean I attacked him. I cannot attack him for any reason. “It is sad that few elements are trying to twist my statement to score cheap political goals. I am not distracted. My friendship with Tinubu is deep-rooted and I am not quarrelling with him. “I am not against his ambition of becoming the president. It is the choice of the party to determine who becomes the presidential candidate.” Tinubu had last week Monday opened up on his 2023 presidential ambition. The APC National Leader had informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his aspirations to succeed him in office. He noted that contesting for the presidency was his lifelong dream. The former governor, however, disclosed that he was still consulting with relevant stakeholders regarding his aspiration.
