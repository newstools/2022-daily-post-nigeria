Salihu Lukman, an All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain, has demanded that leaders working to undermine the February 26 convention be sanctioned. The former Director-General of Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), made the call in a statement on Sunday. Lukman has been vocal against the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) in recent months. He urged the party to return to the era when internal debates, negotiations and agreements were respected. Lukman said the APC has derailed because President Muhammadu Buhari does not meddle in affairs. The member accused some leaders of abusing the trust of both the president and majority of party members. “This has damaged the profile of the APC to the point whereby, based on the conduct of leaders and some elected representatives, it is difficult to associate the APC with its founding vision of change.” He condemned intolerance and how certain stalwarts expect members to be blindly loyal despite their grievances. Lukman declared that the current APC is not that of 2013 to 2015 before it assumed power. The ex-DG said outside President Buhari, there are very few elected leaders who are still committed to the change mantra. The statement charged the party to insist on producing office holders highly tolerant and accommodate dissenting opinions.
