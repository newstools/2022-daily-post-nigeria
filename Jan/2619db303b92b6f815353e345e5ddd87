Ahead of the Ekiti governorship primary election scheduled to hold on January 27, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) on Tuesday screened all the governorship aspirants in the State. The Ekiti State governorship election screening committee chaired by Senator Domingo screened all the aspirants at the national secretariat of the Party in Abuja. Those screened are: Senator Opeyemi Bamidele, former Secretary to the State Government, Mr. Biodun Oyebanji, Senator Dayo Adeyeye, Mr. Femi Bamisile and a former Commissioner for Public Utilities, Mr. Bamidele Faparusi, Mr. Kayode Ojo, Mr. Oluwatoyin Olusola and Mr Ademola Popoola. However, it could not be confirmed as of the time of filing this report if any of the aspirants was disqualified. The governorship election would take place on June 18 to elect a new governor when the incumbent Governor, Kayode Fayemi completes his second term in office on October 15. The governorship election timetable in Ekiti was altered when the legal battle between Segun Oni and Fayemi over the 2007 governorship election was decided in favour of the latter.
