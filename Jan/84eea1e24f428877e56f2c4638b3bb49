The Chief of Defence Staff, Lucky Irabor has said the Military will fully go after bandits. Irabor said the official declaration by the Federal Government would pave the way for the Armed Forces to give bandits a bloody nose. The Defence Chief spoke while appearing on the Nigerian Television Authority, NTA, programme, ‘Good Morning Nigeria’, on Monday. Irabor disclosed that declaring bandits as terrorists had been the desire of the Military. He said the armed Forces would change its tactics in the fight against bandits. According to Irabor: “The issue of gazetting the bandits as terrorists is a news that is quite gladdening. That has always been what we had desired. “What it means is that our tactics, techniques and procedures that we use in handling them certainly would have to change and that is why, I believe going forward, I am sure you will be reading what the outcome of those engagements are. “Gazetting them as terrorists give it a global disposition that will enable other key global actors to now take certain action against them. For me, it will only get better and we will give them the bloody nose that they so desire.” The Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami recently announced the gazetting of bandits as terrorists. Malami said the step was taken after an Abuja Federal High Court proscribed the activities of all bandit groups in the country. The North has seen an increase in the activity of banditry in recent time, with States like Katsina, Kaduna, Niger, Zamfara recording more casualties. Schools, religious centres, and commuters have been attacked, while students, religious leaders, and commuters have been kidnapped and killed by bandits.
