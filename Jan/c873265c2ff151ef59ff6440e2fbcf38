Nollywood actress, Uche Jombo has opined that pastors are making some people slaves. The actress, in a tweet on Saturday, advised Nigerians to focus on knowing and worshipping God. Her reaction is coming at a time when an evangelist, Fumilayo Adebayo, nicknamed Mummy G.O, claimed many people were going to hell fire for playing football, watching comedy, among other reasons. Mummy G.O, in one of the clips, also claimed that she has been a virgin all her life, despite having had premarital sexual relationship and given birth to children. Uche Jumbo in a tweet wrote, “Many people are enslaved mentally by pastors when the focus should be knowing and worshiping God.”
