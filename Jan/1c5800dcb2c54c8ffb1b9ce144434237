The leadership of the youth wing of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the Southwest has vowed to take legal actions against the Publicity Secretary of the People’s Democratic Party, in Ondo State, Kennedy Peretei over allegations made against Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu’s son, Babajide. While giving the PDP’s scribe seven days to publish his proof that Babajide had been using proxy companies to siphon funds from the state coffers, the youth leader said Peretei had been untruthful with his claims. The PDP Publicity Secretary had on Sunday claimed that Babajide had been using proxy companies to collect contracts and loot the funds of the state government. A statement issued by the Southwest APC Youth Leadership, Kolade Paff Lawal, described the claims as mischievous and malicious. Lawal said, “Peretei deliberately mixed lies with a little information to misinform the general public.” The statement said further that “For the avoidance of doubt, Mr Babajide Akeredolu is an Adult in Nigeria who reserves the right to have a company or have companies. “However, Babajide is not connected to many of the companies mentioned by the writer in any way. It is also important to note that even with the companies he has, he never took contracts from the government. “Mr Peretei is demanded within seven days to make public details of the contracts he claimed were collected by Babajide Akeredolu from the government, or his company, including the worth of the contracts and other necessary details.” “Also, Mr Babajide Akeredolu is not connected in any way with some of those companies. If the writer feels otherwise, he can present his proof. Mr Babajide, through the services of the companies, has offered pro-Bono services to the Ondo State Government to support his father and the records are there. “It is uncivilized, to feel you can simply pick your pen and attack the image of other people all in the name of politics or political attention for your party.”
