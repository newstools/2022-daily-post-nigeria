Afenifere groups in the United Kingdom and Europe have alleged plans by some politicians aspiring for top offices in the 2023 general elections to compromise security agents and the electoral body in a bid to manipulate their ways into victory. The group which made this known in a statement issued on Friday by its Secretary, Engr. Anthony Ajayi insisted that restructuring is the only solution to the current crisis rocking the entire nation. Afenifere urged eligible voters to explore the 2023 elections in order to deepen democracy and enhance the frontier of true federalism in the country. Parts of the statement reads, “We know already that politicians are going to use restructuring for their campaigns, so Nigerians should scorn anyone that will use restructuring as a campaign issue again. They have taken us for a ride for too long. “They are also banking on palliatives and money at polling units to buy their way into office. They are already perfecting arrangements to compromise security agents and the judiciary including INEC officials to ensure their victory come 2023. The statement said the idea of restructuring is aimed at making sure that the country has a balanced national development, unity and peaceful co-existence, urging Nigerians to be ready to vote and ensure that their votes count.
