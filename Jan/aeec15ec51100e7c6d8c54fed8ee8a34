As the stake for the 2023 general elections in Rivers State continues to rise, agitations by some ethnic nationalities in the state to be given the governorship ticket have also continued to increase. Just recently a group from Ogoniland had threatened to boycott the 2023 governorship election if the Governorship tickets of major political parties are not zoned to the area. Speaking on the threat, a former member of the House of Representatives, Igo Aguma said ethnic groups must reach out and build bridges to enable them secure the governorship seat, informing that Ikwerre people did the same to secure the position. Aguma who is a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party while acknowledging that the PDP will not abandon the zoning arrangement, however, said the zoning issue is only one factor in determining the candidate of the party. “I will also tell you PDP will never overlook the issue of zoning in making a choice of who would be their flag bearer but zoning though written into the PDP constitution is only one factor, there are several other factors. What is your interpersonal relationship? What are your programmes? How do you want to consolidate what the state has already built? What is the general electoral view of you? Are you a sellable candidate? “They must build bridges; I must be comfortable with the person aspiring. So you cannot just use the race or where you come from as the only card on which you are qualified to be Governor”.
