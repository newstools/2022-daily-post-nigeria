Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, has said some of his fringe players will leave the club in the last week of the January transfer window. Rangnick admitted there are “negotiations with clubs” going on behind the scenes at Old Trafford. Players like Anthony Martial, Jesse Lingard, Donny van de Beek, Eric Bailly and Dean Henderson are among those keen on moving in a bid to find more regular first team football. “I don’t know [what’s going to happen], I know which players would want to leave. “I know that there are some negotiations with clubs but I am not involved in that but I will probably be posted and made aware if something is happening. We will all have to wait and see what happens,” Rangnick said. United are still in three competitions and are facing a hectic second half of the season. The 1-0 win over West Ham United on Saturday meant they ended the weekend in the top four after both Tottenham Hotspur, who lost to Chelsea, and Arsenal, who were held to a 0-0 draw by Burnley, dropped points.
