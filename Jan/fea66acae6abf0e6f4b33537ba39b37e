Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, has said he has a choice to take off either Edinson Cavani or Mason Greenwood during the 1-0 defeat to Wolves on Monday. Rangnick has been roundly criticized for replacing Greenwood with Bruno Fernandes with the scoreline still 0-0. His decision was also booed by fans inside Old Trafford. On replacing Greenwood with Fernandes: “It was 0-0. Bruno had a big chance to put us 1-0 ahead. “Mason was good but I had to take someone off and didn’t want to take off one of the sixes. “I had to decide whether to take off Edi or Mason so took off Mason.” Joao Moutinho’s strike eventually consigned United to a 1-0 defeat, leaving the Red Devils in seventh place on the table.
