The speculations over the possible return for former President Goodluck Jonathan have continued to gather steam as the country moves closer to the 2023 general elections. Already, there have been reports that Jonathan was being considered by a section of the presidency and some governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the presidential ticket of the party come 2023. Besides, the former president’s recent visit to Presidential Villa, twice in a week, has increased the anxiety within the ruling party. Recall that the former President had last week met with South-South leaders coordinating his alleged return to the Presidency in 2023. Against this background, campaign posters of the former president have saturated social media lately. But in spite of President Muhammadu Buhari’s claim during his recent interview with Channels TV that he would keep his choice to his chest, there are indications that Buhari was the brain behind Jonathan’s project. According to a source, “Buhari is the one behind Jonathan’s 2023 presidency. Remember my group, we met with the former president in Bayelsa. Despite all our effort, we didn’t know how the story was leaked to the press.” The source pointed out that though the former President was still reluctant, Buhari wants him to contest.
