Governor Abdullahi Ganduje has stirred dust in Kano State after he paid a surprise condolence visit to Haruna Ahmadu Zago, the court-recognised chairman of the party. His visit comes at a time the government is battling to retain the state leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC), which was annulled by the Abuja High Court. Already, there is palpable tension in the camp of Ganduje over the possible jettison of his factional APC chairman, Abdullahi Abbas, who has been struggling to sustain his position after being thrown out by the court. Two APC parallel congresses were held in October 2021 by both Shekarau and Ganduje camps with Danzago emerging from the Shekarau faction while Abdullahi Abbas emerged from Ganduje’s camp. Revealing the Ganduje visit to Haruna Zago on Saturday, the governor’s New Media Adviser, Aminu Abubakar, said his boss visited the APC factional chairman to condole him for losing his brother. The visit followed the latest judgment by the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in Abuja on Thursday, which dismissed two motions filed by the Ganduje-led faction of the APC against the recognition of the Danzago-led leadership of the party in Kano. Previous rulings of the court on November 30 and December 17, 2021, were also against Ganduje’s faction. The two factions had held parallel congresses and produced two sets of state executives on October 18.
