Nigerian Grammy-award winning singer, Burna Boy has called out the Rivers State government over the environmental situation of the city. Bunkering and illegal crude oil refining activities are on the high rise in different riverine communities of Rivers State. Burna Boy, in a series of posts, sought a solution to the menace. Alongside pictures of dark clouds and faces of people covered in black, Burna Boy sought the way forward. His post read: “Dark clouds over my city, what is the way forward? “This is what bright sunny days look like for my people now. “Stop the soot in Portharcourt.” Meanwhile, the All Progressives Congress, APC, had called out Governor Nyesom Wike, accusing him of encouraging illegal oil bunkering, which is the major cause of the soot shortening the lives of residents in the State. Wike had in a state-wide broadcast days ago vowed to publish the names of ‘those behind illegal bunkering activities in Okrika communities, Rivers South-East and Rivers South-West Senatorial Districts and declare them wanted if they failed to hand themselves over to the police.
