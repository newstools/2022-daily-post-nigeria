Prince Cornelius and Ogochukwu Onyekwuluje, parents of Chidalu Bright Onyekwuluje, who died of alleged negligence by the management of St Michael’s Boys’ Secondary School, Ozubulu, Anambra State, have withdrawn their daughters from boarding school. The deceased’s father, who spoke to DAILY POST, said he took the option of withdrawing his other children from boarding school after the fate his only son suffered in the hands of the management of a boarding school. Chidalu had died on December 17, 2021, after he took ill in the school and the management allegedly kept him to ensure he finishes his exams, thereby aggravating his health condition, an accusation the school debunked. Prince Onyekwuluje said he has withdrawn his two other daughters, who are boarders in an all-girls secondary school in Awka, both of who are elder to deceased Chidalu. He said: “Bright is my only son and having seen the fate that has befallen him in the hands of the school management as a boarder, I have therefore withdrawn my two daughters who are schooling in St John of God Secondary School, Awka. “I have sat and thought about the things that are happening in boarding schools, including the one in Dowen College, the Deeper Life school in Uyo and now my son in St Michael’s Boys’ College, Ozubulu, and I have concluded that as far as I’m alive, none of my children will ever attend a boarding school in this country anymore. “I did not go to school, so my wish is that all my children will go to good schools, to attain education, but you have seen the fate that befell my only son, Bright Chidalu, so I have made up my mind about boarding schools in Nigeria.” The deceased was last two weeks buried in his home town, Uzoakwa, Ihiala, Anambra State.
