A 20-year-old girl has been killed by yet-to-be-identified persons in Ondo State. The deceased, Ebunoluwa Osatuyi, who was seeking admission into the university, was gruesomely murdered in her father’s house at the Okuta Elerinla axis of Akure, the state capital. Ebunoluwa was killed during the weekend shortly after she returned from a coaching centre where had gone for tutorials ahead of the forthcoming Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, UTME. The deceased was said to have been killed after she met some burglars in her father’s house who had gained access to the house through the windows. The assailants were said to have ransacked all the rooms in the house during the attack. The lifeless body of Ebunoluwa was discovered in a pool of blood by her mother, Bosede Osatuyi, after returning home in the evening. According to the distraught mother, an axe and a pestle that was used to hack her daughter to death were abandoned in the sitting room. “My husband and I entered the sitting room and found our daughter with her two hands tied with rope on the floor. She was bleeding profusely and we also found the axe and a pestle with a bloodstain on the chair including a rope hung on the fan. While calling on the state government and security agencies to find her daughter’s killers and bring them to justice, she added, “We quickly rushed her to the hospital immediately where she was confirmed dead before we went to the police station to report.” Confirming the incident, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, PPRO, Funmilayo Odunlami, disclosed that investigation had commenced following the incident. The PPRO said, “The parents are not suspecting anybody but we have commenced investigation into the matter.”
