Rangers midfielder, Joe Aribo, has given his verdict on Manchester United’s loanee, Amad Diallo, after his side’s 3-3 draw against Ross County on Saturday afternoon. Aribo said Diallo, who joined Rangers on loan from Man United this month, was a constant threat against Ross County. Diallo scored his first goal for Rangers in his debut against Ross County in a Scottish Premiership tie on Saturday. Speaking to Rangers TV shortly after the match, Aribo said: “It’s really good to see him [Diallo], you can see that he’s a constant threat every single time he gets on the ball. “He got on the scoresheet so he’s getting his numbers and that’s so good to see”. Rangers will now face Celtic in their next fixture on Wednesday night.
