The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has cancelled an important meeting with its stakeholders in Ekiti State. The parley was arranged to resolve the lingering crisis in the state chapter ahead of the gubernatorial poll. A statement on Wednesday by the National Secretary, Samuel Anyanwu, however, failed to give a specific reason for the impromptu shift. “This is due to reasons beyond the control of the party. A new date will be communicated in due course”, it read. The PDP leadership said it regretted inconveniences the development had caused the invitees and party members looking forward to the outcome. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) fixed Saturday June 18, 2022, for the state’s governorship election.
