Former Everton, Aston Villa and Scotland striker, Andy Gray, has slammed two Arsenal players, Granit Xhaka and Gabriel, following the Gunners’ Premier League 2-1 defeat to Manchester City on New Year’s Day. Gray said Xhaka and Gabriel committed ‘crimes’ during Arsenal’s defeat to Man City. He branded Xhaka as ‘nuts’, adding that Gabriel should know better after he was sent off during the encounter at Emirates. A penalty from Riyad Mahrez and a late goal from Rodri ensured Pep Guardiola’s side defeated Arsenal to go eleven points clear on top of the Premier League table. “If you look at who committed the crimes here, it was two of the more senior players,” Gray told beIN SPORTS. “Certainly Xhaka at 30 plus has not got the excuse of youth and naivety. He’s just nuts at times, he really is. “You can’t rely on him. He’s given away a stupid penalty today with really poor defending. “Gabriel, he’s not old, but he’s experienced as well. He should know better. Don’t give the referee an opportunity to send you off.” Arsenal still maintains the fourth position on the Premier League table following their defeat to Man City. Arteta’s side will take on Liverpool in the EFL Cup semi-final clash on Thursday.
