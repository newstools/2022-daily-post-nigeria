Former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Anyim Pius Anyim, on Monday, called on the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to respect the zoning principles between the Southern and Northern parts of the country. Anyim made the remark while urging all political parties to zone their presidential ticket to the South East. He said the 2023 presidency should be zoned to the Southeast in the spirit of equity, fairness and justice. The former SGF who had declared his presidential ambition said political parties should adhere to the federal character in the zoning of the 2023 presidential ticket. Featuring on Arise News, Anyim said it would be unfair not to allow an Igbo presidency. According to Anyim: “The issue of equity, fairness and justice is a fundamental issue. The federal character is entrenched in every facet of public service which is why it makes sense for the presidency to emerge from the South-East this time. “In the PDP constitution, there is also an agreement about the zoning principle regarding rotation between the North and the South with the region micro zoning amongst themselves. “The reason is that every section of the country must have a sense of belonging; not following it will be a burden on the conscience of the nation.”
