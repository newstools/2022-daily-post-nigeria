A presidential aspirant, Bola Tinubu, has expressed the belief that he would win the 2023 election. Tinubu said with the “strong support” of the masses, he would emerge the winner of the election in 2023. The All Progressives Congress, APC, National Leader disclosed this when he visited the residence of ex-Oyo State Governor, Rashidi Ladoja yesterday. He said reactions from relevant stakeholders have spurred him to continue in his push for the presidency. Tinubu, however, admitted that there would be challenges, but he would overcome them. According to Tinubu: “Life is a challenge and you must be ready to confront challenges and overcome. I have the confidence that I will overcome any form of challenge. “The reactions of critical stakeholders to my presidential ambition have been very positive, encouraging and overwhelming and these have spurred me on with the strong conviction that we would succeed and emerge victorious after the election. “We are forging ahead and with the strong support of the masses of Nigerians, we are going to achieve a resounding victory.” Tinubu had last week informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his presidential intentions.
