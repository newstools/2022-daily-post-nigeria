The Ekiti State Government on Thursday said it has uncovered plots by some politicians within the All Progressives Congress (APC) to defame Governor Kayode Fayemi as the race for the 2023 presidency intensifies. The government made the allegation in a statement signed by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Yinka Oyebode, alerting the general public of a fresh plot by some ‘political interests’ to soil the name of the Governor. The statement said, ” The general public is hereby alerted of a fresh plot by some political interests to activate a spate of negative media campaigns against the person of Dr Kayode Fayemi, Governor of Ekiti State and Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF). ”The plot, as uncovered, is to use some faceless political groups and political jobbers from different parts of the country to defame the Ekiti State Governor.” Oyebode disclosed that the plot is to present Fayemi as unacceptable to people in the six geo-political zones of the country as a way of changing the ”game plan for the 2023 presidential contest”. The statement, however, said the governor has not announced his intention to contest for the seat, adding that his current assignment in Ekiti is his major focus as reiterated in his recent interview with Arise TV on January 1, 2021. While accusing ‘some entrenched interests within the ruling All Progressives Congress’ of the plot which it described as cheap blackmail and negative response to Fayemi’s rising profile, Oyebode urged the public to disregard the ‘potpourri of lies and cheap blackmail that could be released in the coming days”. The statement condemned the purported plan to destroy the image of the governor, adding that every qualified adult is eligible to be the president.
