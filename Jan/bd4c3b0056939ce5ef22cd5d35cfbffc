Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, has said the police foiled an initiative aimed at securing the Lagos-Ibadan expressway. He noted that collaboration with the regional body, Southwest Security Stakeholders Group (SSSG), would have reduced terrible incidences. In a statement on Thursday, Adams condemned incessant attacks on travellers by bandits and robbers operating on the ever-busy road. The Yoruba leader disclosed that in September 2021, the SSSG wrote to the police and DSS for joint patrol. “The reason for the request is to use our strength and network to secure the Lagos-Ibadan expressway which has remained porous. “The idea came up after a series of meetings with leaders and members of the Southwest Security Stakeholders Group. “The letter dated September 22, 2021, was addressed to Security Advisers, Commissioners of Police, Directors of State Security Services (DSS), and other agencies in Lagos, Ogun and Oyo.” Adams said the offer was to be done in good faith to force down the rate of kidnappings and killings and nip other challenges in the bud. He said being the Aare, many people have requested his mediation, reminding the government that its operatives alone cannot secure lives and property. “It’s time to tell the world of our efforts in securing the region. The road has become volatile for travellers, there is a need for urgent intervention. “The SSSG, with about 10 security groups, have the strength to support the police in making sure that the spate of insecurity is curbed.” The organization comprises Oodua People’s Congress (OPC), Agbekoya, Vigilante Group of Nigeria (VGN), Agbekoya Peace Movement.
