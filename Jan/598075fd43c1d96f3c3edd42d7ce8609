Hope for the conduct of local government elections by Governor Willie Obiano-led administration has finally dimmed as the Anambra State House of Assembly has renewed the tenure of the 21 council chairmen in the state. There had been hopes in some quarters that Obiano would toe the path of his predecessor, Peter Obi, and conduct local government elections before leaving office. However, the state house of assembly on Obiano’s orders on Thursday renewed the tenure of the Local Government Transition Committee chairmen for another three months. The speaker of the assembly, Rt Hon Uchenna Okafor, who presided over the plenary said: “The extension of their tenure in line with Section 208 of the local government law as requested by Governor Willie Obiano.” Addressing the local government chairmen after the extension of their tenure, the speaker charged them to continue to work with the House and Governor Obiano to attract dividends of democracy to their various local government areas.
