The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Tuesday, accused the Nigerian security forces of lying against its members. IPOB said contrary to claims by security agencies, that Eastern Security Network, ESN, is not a militant group and are not cannibals. A statement by IPOB’s spokesman, Emma Powerful, reiterated that the group has no camps in Lilu, Orsumoghu in Anambra State and Mbaise, Obowo in Imo State. Powerful in a statement said, “The global movement and family of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) under the command and leadership of our great leader Mazi Nnamdi KANU wish to once again, debunk the falsehood and propaganda by the Nigeria army and police against innocent Biafran youths especially Eastern Security Network ESN operatives. “The Nigeria Army Commander, as well as the Police Commissioner in Imo State, derive pleasure in dishing out fake information and falsehood to disrepute IPOB and ESN operatives. “We, therefore, want to once again, declare that contrary to fabricated lies by the security agencies, ESN has no camp in Lilu, Orsumoghu in Anambra State and Mbaise, Obowo in Imo State. The claims by the Nigerian security agencies that they discovered IPOB/ESN camps in the affected communities are all lies concocted to blackmail us and justify further destruction of more Igbo communities by security agents. “IPOB and ESN have no camps in these communities. We are not militants nor cannibals. Criminals can never be said to be IPOB/ESN members. We are not cultists. Our mission is the restoration of Biafra, and that has nothing to do with cannibalism and abominable things allegedly going on in such camps. “Nigerian security agencies and government of Imo State created these criminals thinking they can demonize IPOB and ESN members but unfortunately they turned against innocent members of the society.”
