Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand, has urged Arsenal defender Gabriel to look to the likes of Ruben Dias and Virgil van Dijk to learn how to keep composure in the heat of battle. Ferdinand was not happy with Gabriel’s behaviour during Arsenal’s 2-1 defeat to Manchester City after the Brazilian allowed himself to be sent off when the Ginners were leading the league leaders 1-0. Bukayo Saka gave Arsenal the lead in the first half, but Riyad Mahrez equalized with a penalty in the second half after Gabriel was booked for trying to scuff up the spot. Gabriel was then sent off just two minutes later after fouling Gabriel Jesus and Rodri netted a late winner to give the visitors all three points. ‘He’s got to be the leading centre half here at the moment and you’ve got to curb that. You’ve got to take the emotion out of the situation,’ he went on,” Ferdinand said on BT Sport. “When you’re in the heat of battle you won’t see Dias doing that, you won’t see Virgil van Dijk doing that. They then calm the others around them, that’s what leaders do. “You can get amped and uptight in a situation. But when the game restarts you have to have laser focus back on the job. “He is the total opposite of that. Maybe it’s inexperience but that’s something I feel people behind the scenes at Arsenal really need to get a hold of because you can’t continue losing people.”
