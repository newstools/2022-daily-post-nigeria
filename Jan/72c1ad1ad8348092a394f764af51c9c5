The opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, on Saturday, dismissed the All Progressives Congress, APC-led government’s performance claims in 2021 as reeled out by Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed. The PDP described it as a litany of lies. Debo Ologunagba, PDP National Publicity Secretary, in a statement, challenged the President Buhari led-government to name one landmark project it conceptualised, commenced and completed in the last six years. The PDP, however, believed that Nigerians will not hold back in pronouncing verdict on the APC in the 2023 elections through their votes. The statement, while questioning the performance claims, said such can only be “a product of delusions of grandeur; a joke of the year.”
