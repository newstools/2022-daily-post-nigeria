Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, has described as timely, the warning by President Muhammadu Buhari on the need for All Progressives Congress (APC) leaders to put their house in order or else lose power to the opposition in 2023. Recall that Buhari had taken to an interview anchored by the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), Thursday, to warn that PDP stands a better chance to clinch power in the forthcoming general elections if differences, disunity and lack of agreement, persists within the APC. Lalong, who doubles as Chairman of the Northern Governors Forum corroborated the President, shortly after they met at the presidential villa, Abuja, on Friday. According to Lalong, the President’s warning behoves on the party to redouble efforts and mend fences early enough. He noted that the President’s remark is a signal for the party to have a seamless convention so as not to disintegrate. He assured that the APC will meet Sunday to decide on a definite date for the conduct of the party’s national convention. Insisting that the meeting will centre on the proposed date for the convention. Lalong added that the governors have given the President the assurance that the convention will hold in February 2022. He observed that as a political party, the APC is made up of different interests saying, “what matters is that at the end of the day, we will elect our representatives.”
