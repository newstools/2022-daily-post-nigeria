The Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) in Kaduna State has charged the 23 local government chairmen of the party to work hard towards the 2023 general elections to wrestle power from the ruling APC. The State Chairman, Felix Hassan Hyat gave the charge when the local government chairmen paid him a courtesy visit for the new year. Edward John Auta, Senior Assistant Media and Public Affairs to the party in the state in a statement on Friday, said, “the Chairmen who came on a New Year visit reiterated their support and faith in the Hassan Hyat-led State Working Committee of the party in the state. ”The party Chairmen also promised to work together in the party’s bid to rescue Kaduna State from the misgovernance of the APC”. He said the Hassan Hyat led State Working Committee also admonished them to be wary of anything that can derail the party from conducting free, fair and credible primaries in their respective areas by being neutral at all times.
