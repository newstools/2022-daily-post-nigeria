The United Nations have demanded the immediate release of Burkina Faso President, Roch Marc Christian Kabore and other top officials of the country following a military takeover. The UN Human Rights Office said it was crucial to preserve a democratic space in the West African nation and respect the rule of law. Spokeswoman of the UN, Ravina Shamdasani speaking with reporters in Geneva said, “We call on the military to immediately release President Roch Marc Christian Kabore and other high-level officials who have been detained. “We urge a swift return to constitutional order.” On Monday, soldiers in Burkina Faso seized power after the government failed to support them during a deadly insurgency. A junior officer announced the suspension of the constitution, the dissolution of the government and parliament and the closure of the country’s borders.
