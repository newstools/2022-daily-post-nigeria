Manchester United are close to appointing a new manager that would replace interim boss, Ralf Rangnick. Recall that Rangnick was appointed as Man United interim manager following the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer last November. The German was appointed Man United interim manager until the end of the season. The 63-year-old will then take up a two-year consultancy role at Old Trafford. But according to French football journalist Dominique Severac, Man United are close to an agreement with Paris Saint-Germain boss Mauricio Pochettino to replace Rangnick at Old Trafford. Severac, who stated this on La Ghaine L’Equipe (via PSG Talk), said Pochettino’s switch to Man United is “almost done”. He said, “He [Pochettino] won’t be able to say anything to each other before the end of the season, but for me, it’s almost done! “I’m telling you what I know. Manchester United wants him, and he wants to go (…) so we are not far from an agreement!” Pochettino’s contract with PSG is due to expire in June 2023, meaning Man United will have to pay compensation to the French Ligue 1 giants. Recall that Pochettino has been heavily linked with the Manchester United job since last November. Reports had emerged earlier this week that former Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane is the one who will take Pochettino’s place at PSG.
