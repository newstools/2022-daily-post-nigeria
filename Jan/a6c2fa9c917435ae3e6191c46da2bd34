Super Eagles winger, Moses Simon, has issued a strong warning to Nigeria’s next opponents in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. Nigeria mounted pressure on the Pharaohs of Egypt from the first whistle to the last blast of the game and were rewarded by Kelechi Iheanacho’s 30th-minute strike. Simon, who troubled the Egyptian defence from the start of the game, pointed out that there were no small teams in Africa any more. “The game against Sudan is something we need to be careful with because now in Africa there is no small team so we need to face them the way we played against Egypt,” Simon told reporters when asked about Nigeria qualifying for the next round if they defeat Sudan on Saturday. “We have to do our best and give one hundred percent to have the three points.”
