A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Yekini Nabena has said no aspirant will get the party’s 2023 presidential ticket on a silver platter. Nabena, former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the APC, made the remark while reacting to the declaration of Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the party to run for the presidency. Tinubu had disclosed that he had informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his ambition to run for the presidency in 2023. He disclosed this after a meeting with Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, on Monday. Reacting, Nabena said the party would follow the laid down procedures in deciding its presidential candidate. Nabena said Tinubu should consult widely because APC is not a “come-and-take” party. “The APC will not give any of its members’ presidential ticket on a platter of gold. There are procedures so he (Tinubu) should continue consulting. “The APC is not a come-and-take party. He should consult even those contesting with him. “So consultations should continue and whoever emerges at the primaries will be the party’s presidential candidate for 2023,” Nabena told journalists in Abuja.
