Zamfara State has reportedly turned to a political battlefield between Governor Bello Matawalle’s faction and Senator Kabiru Marafa’s faction of the All Progressive Congress (APC). The ruling party is also reported to be embroiled in controversy with the state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP). The war of words between chieftains in the APC has now resulted in an alleged gang up against Governor Matawalle by Marafa’s faction of the APC and the PDP side. In a reaction, the spokesman of Marafa’s faction of the APC, Bello Bakyasuwa Maradun said his group jumped into the ongoing controversy in the state because the Publicity Secretary of Matawalle’s faction, accused General Aliyu Gusau (rtd) of sponsoring banditry in the state due to mining activities. “General Gusau is not the leader of PDP in the state and he is not the chairman of the party in the state and has never been an appointee in the state government, then why connecting him with the insecurity situation in the state” “The truth remains that Governor Matawalle has failed woefully that is why he is busy accusing people falsely just to give excuses for his failure” He said the state was on fire while the Governor was away in Niger Republic enjoying himself with traditional wrestling and dances, stressing that the Governor does not care for the life of anyone in the state. “If the Governor claims that he was innocent of the accusations against his government by the PDP over embezzlement of N31 billion naira security vote from the federation account, why has he remained silence which indicated his admission of the allegation” “The state government has taken blackmail as a way of moving their government forward which the antigraft agencies are taking record of, waiting for the expiration of his unfortunate tenure” “Even Senator Marafa’s faction of the APC has the whole record of what is coming into the state government’s account, where it is going and who and who are the illegal beneficiaries of the deal” Bakyasuwa appealed to the Zamfara State residents to be calm as the faction continues to unfolds the truth, stressing it had earlier planted people in the government to checkmate the administration for record purposes. He said the faction is getting all the needed information from the state government. “Governor Matawalle does not know much about politics but instead of him to bend down for his political masters and learn, he prefers to show that he is the first citizen of the state which we have decided to show him how to play politics”
