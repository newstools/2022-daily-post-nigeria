A man simply identified as Nana, has reportedly stabbed one Onos to death in Sapele Local Government Area of Delta State. The suspect fled the scene after killing the deceased, DAILY POST gathered. The incident occurred along Old road at Amukpe in Sapele. This is even as the police have arrested one Blessing in connection with the alleged murder of the deceased until he produces his brother, Nana. It was learnt that the two brothers, Nana and Blessing had a quarrel over an issue and there was so much noise within their compound when the deceased came out and asked that they leave their gate. Angered by Onos responses, Nana queried why the deceased shouted at him and his brother and their mother. In the process, a serious fight ensued as he stabbed the deceased with a broken and sharp bottle in the chest. The deceased died on the spot before he was rushed to Obule hospital in Sapele. When contacted, the Delta State Police Public Relations Officer,DSP Bright Edafe in a telephone chat with Our Correspondent said,”Am not aware of the matter ooo.” The incident has forced neighbours of the deceased to flee their compound for fear of Police arrest, interrogation and possible prosecutions.
