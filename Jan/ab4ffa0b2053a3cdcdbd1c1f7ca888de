Captain of the Super Eagles, Ahmed Musa, has left the training camp ahead of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. Musa missed the team’s last training session on Wednesday, after losing a family member. The Fatih Karagumruk of Turkey winger was given permission to travel and be with his family members following the loss. The 28-year-old will however join up with the rest of the squad in Cameroon ahead of Nigeria’s first game against Egypt on January 11. Meanwhile, another striker, Odion Ighalo, may not feature at the tournament following the refusal of Al-Shabab to approve his release. A clause in the contract he signed with the Saudi Arabian club, which indicated that he was no longer active internationally for Nigeria, was now preventing him from participating at the tournament. Ighalo was recalled to the Super Eagles in November after announcing his retirement earlier and being away from the team for over two years.
