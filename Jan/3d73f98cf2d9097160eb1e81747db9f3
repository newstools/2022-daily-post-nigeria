Evangelist Fumilayo Adebayo, nicknamed Mummy G.O’s hellfire meme, has revealed what God told her to preach to people in the world. In an interview with BBC Pidgin, Mummy G.O said God told her to preach to people in the world that they should focus on heaven. She explained that Jesus is coming back and people should do the things that would make them go to heaven and not enter hell. She said, “This ministry is 24 years old. God called me 27 years ago, but my ministry started 24 years ago. “What God gave me to preach to people is that they should focus on heaven and things they should do that will not make them enter heaven that will send them to hell and things that they should do that will make them go heaven and not enter hell. “That is my message and to prepare the souls of people for the rapture because Jesus is coming back whether people believe it or not, so he said I should be preparing their hearts because he is coming back so that they should not forget.”
