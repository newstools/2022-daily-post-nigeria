President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed heartfelt condolences to the Ahmad family on the passing of the former Comptroller-General of the Nigeria Customs Service, Hamman Ahmad. In a condolence message signed by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, on Wednesday, Buhari described late Ahmad as a humble gentleman. Buhari said, “The nation has lost one of its best-trained sons. His nearly four decades of service to the motherland was marked by exceptional knowledge of the field and commitment to duty in the Customs. “After his retirement, he continued to serve the nation through investment in agriculture in response to the calls of the government for citizens to go back to the land.” He prayed for the repose of his soul, commiserating with the Adamawa Emirate Council and the State Government on behalf of the nation.
