Manchester United are in ‘pole position’ to sign midfielder Boubacar Kamara from French Ligue 1 side, Marseille. Manchester United are now ahead of Real Madrid, Barcelona, Newcastle United and Leeds United in the race to sign the highly sought after midfielder Kamara’s contract at Marseille expires at the end of the season and from all indications he does not want to renew his deal. The Sun reports that Marseille want to sell the player for around £10 million, which could prove to be a steal for a player who has already racked up over 100 Ligue 1 appearances. Kamara now wants around £150,000-a-week following the competition for his signature. According to the report, Manchester United have already spoken to his representatives. Manchester United boss, Ralf Rangnick wants to bring a central midfielder to his squad and provide competition for the duo of Fred and Scott McTominay in the engine room.
