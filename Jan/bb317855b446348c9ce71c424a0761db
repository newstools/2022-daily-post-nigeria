There was heavy shooting in the boundary between Oko community in Orumba North Local Government Area and Ekwulobia community in Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State on Monday. DAILY POST gathered that suspected members of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) got to the boundary and started shooting sporadically, causing panic in the area. A source in the area said the shooting forced residents of the area to scamper into hiding, just as a Toyota Sienna vehicle belonging to an unidentified indigene of Isuofia, neighbouring community to Ekwulobia was set ablaze. “The man was driving towards the area when the men started shooting. He left his car on the middle of the road and ran for his life, but before he could return, the men had set it ablaze,” the source said. Meanwhile, the Anambra State Police Command has confirmed the incident. The spokesperson for the Anambra State Police Command, DSP Toochukwu Ikenga, who confirmed it, said the State Commissioner of Police, CP Echeng Eworo has deployed men to the area. He said: “The Commissioner of Police, CP Echeng has since ordered reinforcement teams from the command headquarters to intensify patrols around major areas like Onitsha, Nnewi, Ihiala, Aguata, Awka and other environs in the State. “The reinforcement teams comprise Police Mobile Operatives, Counter Terrorist Units, Special Forces and other tactical teams.
