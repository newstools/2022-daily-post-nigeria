The people of Eziuba Ubudom in Njaba local government area of Imo State have been thrown into fear following the beheading of one Nnoruoka Onyeokwu, a 65 years old man by some yet to be identified gunmen. DAILY POST gathered that Onyeokwu whose head was displayed at the State Primary School, Ubudom Atta, was abducted from his house by gunmen on Saturday night. Confirming the incident, the Interim Management Committee, IMC Chairman of Njaba local government area, Mr. Emeka Iheanacho told DAILY POST, it was regrettable. He said Gov Hope Uzodinma was doing everything possible to curtail the spate of attacks in the area. The IMC chairman said, ” This is a sensitive matter and I will not like to say more because the security operatives are on top of the situation. He assured that the perpetrators would be brought to book soonest. A community source who pleaded anonymity said no one knew the abductors or the reason for beheading the slain Onyeokwu. Njaba, one of the councils that make up Imo West (Orlu) senatorial zone had since 2021 been under severe attacks from gunmen, including the murder of two traditional rulers while they were attending a meeting at the council headquarters in Nnennasa. Recall that a traditional ruler, Eze Edwin Azike, was kidnapped in his community on December 8 and his corpse dumped at the market square the next day. However, efforts to get the reaction of the Police spokesperson for the state, Michael Abattam on the matter proved abortive as he requested time to confirm the development.
