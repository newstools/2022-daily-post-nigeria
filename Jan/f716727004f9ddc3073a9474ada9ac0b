Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, on Sunday, said security should be beefed up to avoid the wastage of lives. Atiku made the call while reacting to the killing of residents of Bukkuyum and Anka Local Government Areas of Zamfara State. He described the killings of residents of the areas as senseless and heartbreaking. In a post on his Facebook, the former Vice President wrote: “When I expressed my deepest condolences to the people and government of Zamfara State on the 6th of January over the senseless killing of innocent citizens in Bukkuyum and Anka Local Government Areas of the state, little did I know that the tragedy that befell the people was far worse than envisaged. “It is heartbreaking to have dozens of innocent citizens killed in just one day. It is a traumatic experience to imagine. “Even as I sympathise with people in the affected families and the affected communities, yet again, as they bury their dead, I expect that security be ramped up to stem this waste of precious human lives. “May the affected families be comforted. I pray that God forgives their sins and grant them rest in Paradise.”
