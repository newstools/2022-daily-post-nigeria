The Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to return Nigeria to regionalism before the 2023 elections. The Yoruba socio-cultural group made the call in a communique on Friday after a meeting in Lagos. General Secretary, Babajide Tanimowo lamented the state of the nation and urged Buhari to use the remaining months of his tenure to fix insecurity and “failing structure”. The OPC commended the declaration of bandits as terrorists and charged the government to expose and prosecute the sponsors. “This is the most critical moment of the Buhari administration and he needs to be honest with himself. “Whether you call it restructuring or regionalism, certain decisions must be made in order to save Nigeria from this misdirection.” The scribe reiterated that the OPC led by Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, was not in political talks with groups ahead of the general polls. “We have made our position known in the media that we are not in any accord with any coalition for any reason. “We will not take it lightly with any individual or group that uses OPC’s name for political purposes as the elections draw near.” OPC charged governors to support the Southwest Security Network (Amotekun), Southwest Security Stakeholders Group (SSSG) and other regional outfits to secure people’s lives and property.
