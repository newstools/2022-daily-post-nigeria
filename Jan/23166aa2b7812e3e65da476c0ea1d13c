Tactical teams of the Imo State Police Command have allegedly shot dead a member of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and Eastern Security Network (ESN) In a fierce gun battle in a forest in Onicha, Ezinihitte Mbaise Local Government Area of the state. In a statement on Saturday, the command’s spokesman, CSP Michael Abattam, explained that the hoodlums, on sighting the police operatives, opened fire on them. One of the hoodlums was neutralized while others scampered into the adjoining bushes fatally injured with gunshot injuries. The release said, “the proscribed IPOB/ ESN terror group, its militia wing has made a forest at Onicha in Ezinihitte Mbaise LGA of Imo State, their operational base where they go out to perpetrate heinous crimes which include terrorism, kidnapping, armed robbery and killing of innocent citizens “Based on this information, the ever combat-ready Imo Command’s tactical teams, having carried diligent surveillance of the criminal hideouts, on 18/1/2022 at about 1300 hours, stormed the deadly terror camp.” Items recovered from them on combing the bush and searching the terror camp includes one AK-47 rifle with 40 rounds of live ammunition, 10 locally-fabricated explosives devices, one police hand grenade, two Toyota Highlander SUVs without registration numbers.
