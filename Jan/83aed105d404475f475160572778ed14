Chelsea have announced a loan deal for attacking midfielder, Tino Anjorin. Anjorin will spend the rest of the season at Huddersfield Town in the Championship. The 20-year-old had returned to Chelsea from his loan spell at Lokomotiv Moscow. Chelsea disclosed this in a statement via their website on transfer deadline day. The statement read, “Tino Anjorin has returned from his loan spell at Lokomotiv Moscow and will spend the rest of the season at Huddersfield Town in the Championship. “The 20-year-old attacking midfielder made eight appearances during his time in Russia and scored his only goal for the club on his debut in the Europa League against Marseille. However, injury has prevented him from featuring since late October as he returned to Cobham for treatment and rehabilitation.” Anjorin, a product of the Chelsea Academy, featured on three occasions for the Blues’ first team last season as he established himself in Thomas Tuchel’s senior squad. He made eight appearances for Lokomotiv during his maiden loan spell.
