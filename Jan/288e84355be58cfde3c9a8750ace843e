Following the collapse of a building housing a branch of Salvation Ministry at Okpanam, Asaba, Delta State, where many worshippers were reportedly trapped, Bishop Ibiyeomie, founder of the ministry, has paid visits to hospitalised victims. DAILY POST recalls that the building, which was rented by the church for worship purposes, collapsed during service on Tuesday. Confirming the incident, the church, in a statement issued and made public on Wednesday, sympathized with the victims, saying an investigation is ongoing. The statement reads, “Salvation Ministry is aware of the incident that occurred on the 11th of January 2022 at Okpanam, Delta State, Nigeria, in a one-storey building, which the church occupies the first floor as a tenant with other tenants occupying the ground floor. “The church is currently working with relevant authorities in investigating the cause of the incident. “Our immediate prayers and thoughts are with the persons and families affected by the incident, and the church is committed to providing all necessary supports while an investigation is ongoing”.
