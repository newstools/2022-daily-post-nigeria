Presidential campaign posters of Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State have emerged. Wike’s campaign posters were sighted in the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Abuja. The posters were sighted on Monday at some traffic kiosks along Airports road, Asokoro and the Federal Secretariat. The posters had the tag: “Here to serve 2023: Barr Ezenwo Nyesom Wike for president.” The posters were sponsored by “Northerners For Change Group”. However, the governor who is a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, is yet to declare his intentions to contest for the presidency. Meanwhile, Bola Tinubu, Yahaya Bello of the All Progressives Congress, among others, have declared their intentions to run for the office of the president in 2023.
