African Democratic Congress (ADC) presidential aspirant, Kingsley Moghalu, has said President Muhammadu Buhari was not the reason for Super Eagles elimination from the Africa Cup of Nations 2021. Recall that Nigeria crashed out of AFCON after a 0-1 loss to the North African side, Tunisia. A goalkeeping error from Maduka Okoye gave the Carthage Eagles the goal a few minutes into the second half. Following the defeat, some Nigerians blamed the loss on President Muhammadu Buhari video call with the Super Eagles earlier before the match. Others blamed Super Eagles goalkeeper, Maduka Okoye, for his error. Reacting, Moghalu, on Twitter said,”@NGSuperEagles lost to Tunisia. Period. It’s not because President @MBuhari called them. “Let’s not be superstitious please. I’m sad though.”
