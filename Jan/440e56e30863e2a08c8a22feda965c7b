Two suspected cultists have been killed during an attack on security detectives in Kwara State. The Kwara State Police Command confirmed their death in a statement on Saturday. The command’s spokesman, SP Ajayi Okasanmi, said that some cultists on Saturday unleashed attacks on a team of police detectives from the Special Tactical Squad (STS) FIB, Abuja, thereby causing pandemonium around the Kwara State Polytechnic gate, Ilorin. NAN quoted him as saying four of the cultists, also students of the institution, were arrested and dangerous weapons recovered from them. He explained that some of the cultists were also hiding at the Lajolo area of Kwara Polytechnic Ilorin, where a similar attack on one student, identified as Idris Aderemi, happened on Saturday morning. “This prompted the visit to the area by the STS team. “Surprisingly, the cultists who were already in ambush, attacked the police team damaging the police Hummer bus, and inflicting a gunshot injury on the head of one police Sergeant, Adebayo Abdulahi, attached to the STS team. “In the ensuing imbroglio, students in their numbers came out to block the road and prevented the free flow of traffic and burning tyres on the road,” the statement read. He added that the injured policeman and the suspects have been taken to the hospital for treatment. During the attack, two cultists; Ahmed and one Musibau ‘m’ aka Shaban, were arrested with one fabricated English pistol with three live ammunition, two live cartridges and one pistol magazine. The Commissioner of Police in the state urged residents to go about their lawful businesses without any fear of attack, adding that security men were on standby to forestall any further act of lawlessness.
