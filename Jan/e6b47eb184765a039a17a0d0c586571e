A suspected armed robber, notorious for disturbing commuters along the Osu/Ondo expressway, has been apprehended by the joint patrol team of Osun and Ondo States operatives of the Western Security Network, Amotekun, in the early hours of Friday, December 31, 2021. According to the information made available to DAILY POST, the suspect was arrested while trying to perpetrate another robbery along the road, with other gang members. The arrest was carried out when Amotekun personnel who were on surveillance around the axis saw them operating on the road. It was gathered that on sighting Amotekun personnel, the gang of armed robbers fled into the bush and one of them was apprehended. Recall that on Wednesday, a J5 bus that was traveling from Lagos State with two passengers and conveying valuables, was attacked at Osu/Ondo expressway. One of the victims of the armed robbery was rescued and the armed robbers dislodged by Amotekun personnel who were on patrol during the yuletide, but the driver of the J5 bus remained missing. Upon interrogation, the arrested suspect, who confessed that he had been operating with others on the road for a long time, revealed that their weapon of choice was made out of wood which was structured in the form of a semi automatic rifle.
