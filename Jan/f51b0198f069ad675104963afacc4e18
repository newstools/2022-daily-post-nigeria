Former Manchester United defender, Paul Parker, has said some members of the club’s current squad do not like Bruno Fernandes. According to him, members of the squad might be having serious problem with the Portuguese midfielder. The former Sporting Lisbon star has endured a tough 2021/2022 season but scored two goals against Aston Villa on Saturday. Parker suggested that there are players in the Manchester United squad who ‘don’t like’ the way he has carried himself at times. “Fernandes is a concern for me,” Parker told Talk of the Devils. “Just watching him and the way he betrays himself on the pitch, I’m sure there are players within that squad that don’t like him and what he does on that pitch. “He brings too much attention to everything. He puts in a bad tackle and he’s telling people to get up. He gets tackled himself and he rolls around, and he wants to show he’s got a nick on his sock or something.” Bruno Fernandes will hope to continue in his goal scoring form when Manchester United meet Brentford in their rescheduled game on Wednesday. Manchester United are currently sixth in the Premier League table 6 points behind fourth-placed West Ham United but could close the gap to three with a win over Brentford.
