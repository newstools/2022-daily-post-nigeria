Super Eagles goalkeeper trainer, Alloy Agu has warned that Ghana would be tough nut to crack during their 2022 World Cup qualifying playoff with Nigeria. He is, however, confident Nigeria will qualify for the tournament in Qatar as the two nations fight for a place in the mundial next month. Ghana crashed out of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in the group stage and have since sacked their coach in preparation for the game against Nigeria. Agu believes the Super Eagles have what it takes to secure a place in Qatar 2022. “Ghana have a formidable squad and will be a tough nut to crack for us, but we have the quality to beat them,” Agu told Completesports.com. “We are confident of qualifying for the World Cup and will do everything possible to achieve our objective. “There’s quality in our team and we will work hard to make it to Qatar 2022.”
