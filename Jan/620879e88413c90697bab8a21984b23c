Operatives of Anti-Cultism Unit of Rivers State Police Command have raided the camp of a local vigilante in Omademe Community in Ikwerre Local Government Area of the state. The operatives stormed the camp and destroyed some properties while the members of the local vigilante escaped. The same operatives had yesterday allegedly invaded and destroyed a camp of another group of vigilante in Igwuruta community in the same local government. The mission of the operatives of the Anti-Cultism Unit of the state command is unknown as commander declined comments when contacted. In the meantime, the leader of the local vigilante group in Omademe Samuel Adele has called on authorities to “call the anti-cultism unit to order”. He noted that there was no prior petition against the group before now and wondered why their camp will be raided. This is coming few days after members of a local vigilante in Omuanwa community in Ikwerre Local Government Area of the state allegedly killed an officer of the Nigerian Air Force. A suspect has also been arrested detained at the state criminal investigation department of the Rivers state police command in connection with the killing.
