Tunisia and Gambia have been eliminated from the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations tournament. They both lost their quarter-final clashes against Burkina Faso and hosts Cameroon on Sunday. The Indomitable Lions needed two second-half goals from Karl Toko Ekambi to see off their lowly-ranked opponents. Cameroon will now meet the winner of the quarter-final between Egypt and Morocco. Meanwhile, teenager Dango Ouattara scored on the stroke of halftime to secure a 1-0 win for Burkina Faso over Tunisia. It is the third time in the last five editions of the continental championship that Burkina Faso have got to the semi-finals. They will face the winners of Sunday’s quarter-final between Senegal and Equatorial Guinea.
