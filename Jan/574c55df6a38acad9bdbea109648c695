A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Zadok Akintoye, has advised the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu to reconsider his presidential aspirations. Akintoye, a former Publicity Secretary of the PDP in Ondo State asked Tinubu to push his political son, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo forward for the ticket ahead of the 2023 general election. Akintoye who stated this in a post on his social media handle, said there will be nothing to pin against Osinbajo, unlike Tinubu who many Nigerians don’t trust. He said, “What should matter is if his ambition aligns with our collective desire for a greater Nigeria. “I must say that his politics and intelligence quite rightly aligns but his track record of corrupt enrichment is the key albatross his aspirations. “Between him and his loyal ally, Osinbajo, I would suggest that the political godfather of political “AlCaponism” give Nigerians a parting gift of a good example in leadership, (if truly it’s about making Nigeria better) by fielding his “son” Yemi Osinbajo. “For once, let’s have a president that we can truly appreciate his intellectual expertise.”
