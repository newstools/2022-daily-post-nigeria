Tottenham Hotspur boss, Antonio Conte, has slammed the Premier League’s decision to postpone their north London derby against Arsenal. Conte described it as “very strange” and called for his team to be shown “more respect”. Spurs were due to host Arsenal as both sides battle for places in the top four, but it was called off on Saturday following the Gunners’ request to the Premier League. Mikel Arteta’s side claimed they had “many players unavailable across our squad as a result of Covid, injuries and players away with their countries at AFCON (Africa Cup of Nations)”. Conte has now questioned why injuries and international call-ups are being taken into account when clubs apply for matches to be postponed. He said: “The club made a statement and I think the club expressed our disappointment about the decision. “It was for sure a strange decision. “My feeling is that when there is a situation to play, we have to play and not postpone games for injuries or for international duty. “We have a big problem to solve with Covid but only about this situation can you decide to postpone. “This is the first time in my life – and I have a bit of experience in football – to see this decision. In this way, anything can happen.”
