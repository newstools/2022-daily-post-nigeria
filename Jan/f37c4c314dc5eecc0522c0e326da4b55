The Senate Chief Whip, Orji Uzor Kalu, has faulted President Muhammadu Buhari’s stance on state police. Appearing on Arise TV, the former Governor of Abia State said states should be allowed to have their own police. Recently, Buhari had said governors will use state police to witch-hunt and intimidate perceived critics and opponents. Ruling out the issue of state police under his administration, Buhari had said: “State police is not an option. Find out the relationship between local government and the governors.” However, Kalu said: “Even when I was governor, I’ve always believed that we should have state police. I don’t have the same opinion as the president (Mr Buhari) on state police. “I’ve always believed that if we have a bill or an act that can convince the Assembly with the constitution, why not.”
