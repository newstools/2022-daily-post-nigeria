Former President Goodluck Jonathan was an august visitor to the State House on Thursday, where he met with President Muhammadu Buhari. Although it marked their first meeting in the new year 2022, Jonathan, who is a regular face at the presidency, was at the seat of power to brief the incumbent on a proposed meeting being convened by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) scheduled for Accra, Ghana on Sunday. Jonathan who relinquished power to Buhari in 2015 following his defeat has been serving as ECOWAS Mediation Team to Mali. The proposed meeting in Ghana, Sunday is expected to deliberate on the political impasse in Mali, for which ECOWAS regional leaders have been mediating to find a common ground for a peaceful transition to democratic governance.
