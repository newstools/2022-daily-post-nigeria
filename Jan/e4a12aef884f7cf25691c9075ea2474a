A chieftain of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Birnin Gwari Local Government Area of Kaduna State, Shehu Mustapha has said there can be no peace in the state if insecurity is not tackled. Shehu Mustapha who was the PDP vice chairman in the local government in 2014 said the major obstacle in the state is the rising cases of insecurity, as kidnappers enrich their pockets from money collected as ransom from families of victims. Mustapha’s comments are in reaction to President Buhari’s visit to the state to commission projects. ”It is only the bandits and criminals that would make better use of the projects if residents of the state are being denied their fundamental human rights by the bandits. “Bandits exist in all the three Senatorial Districts of Kaduna State. As they kidnap, demand ransom and kill at will in Zaria, the same thing to Kafachan and almost every part of Kaduna State is being terrorised daily, with several people in kidnappers den. He expressed worry that those expected to make use of the commissioned roads or infrastructured are the same people who are kidnapped and killed because they have no money to pay for ransom. “Criminals and kidnappers have their field days anytime they wish to strike. Most people in the state are living in fear, even those that have cars have decided to park their cars and walk barefoot to avoid being singled out for kidnappers. “When you commission roads, who are those going to use it? when they have parked their cars for fear of kidnappers?” What every human being needs is peaceful living, besides food, clothing and shelter”. He added that the security of lives and properties is a vital aspect of human living, adding that, one cannot eat if his life is in danger. He called on Governor Nasir El-Rufai to first tackle the criminals, so that residents can have peace, especially at night.
