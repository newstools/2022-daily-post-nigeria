President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has admitted that the 9th Assembly under his leadership is not perfect and has made some errors. Lawan, however, noted that the Assembly will correct its errors before the expiration of their tenure. He spoke on Wednesday when the Senate Press Corps paid a visit to felicitate with him on the occasion of his 63rd birthday in Abuja. The Senate President said the Senate and by extension the National Assembly remains committed to serving the interest of Nigerians in the discharge of its constitutional duties. He added that no amount of name-calling by critics would deter the upper chamber from considering and passing pro-people legislations needed for the development and advancement of the country. According to Lawan: “We believe that there is a price to pay for anything, but we are patriotic. Let us be called any name, what we want to do and achieve is for our country to be better. “Tomorrow, some of these people that are calling us all types of names will be writing very good commentaries about what we have been able to achieve in this Ninth National Assembly. “Majority of Nigerians are happy with what we are doing, we are not perfect, we make our errors and we will correct them. “We identify with our citizens but we will always do what is in the best interest of our country.”
