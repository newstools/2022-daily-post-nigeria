The Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) has said traditional institutions have a vital role to play in the fight against the insecurity situation in Nigeria. NIS Zone B coordinator, ACG Zainab Lawan made the call at the award presentation to outstanding officers in Jigawa State. She explained that the security agencies need the support and cooperation of traditional leaders to succeed in the fight against criminals and criminalities in the country. “We need traditional rulers in maintaining the security situation of the Nation because they are more relevant in ensuring peace, stability and wellbeing of every given society. “They are the gatekeepers of any society and also the custodian of tradition and culture,” she said. Zainab, therefore, urged traditional leaders to support security agencies in the maintenance of peace and unity for national development. The Jigawa State comptroller, Isma’il Abba Said, the officers were awarded based on their honesty, dedication and commitments to their various responsibilities. He however advised the officers to work hard while discharging their responsibilities.
