Odion Ighalo is set to leave Al Shabab for Al Hilal. This was confirmed by Italian football expert, Fabrizio Romano, via his verified Twitter page on Saturday. According to Romano, Ighalo has agreed on personal terms in a contract until June 2023. “Al Hilal are set to sign former Watford and Man United striker Odion Ighalo. Agreement reached on personal terms, contract until June 2023. “Final details and the official announcement in place. Ighalo will be Al Hilal replacement for Gomis,” Romano wrote. Ighalo has been at Al Shabab since February 2021, after signing a two and a half years deal. The Saudi Arabian club recently blocked the 32-year-old from representing Nigeria at the ongoing 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. Super Eagles interim coach, Austin Eguavoen, then claimed the Confederation of African Football (CAF) blocked him from calling up a replacement for the player.
