A former President of the Nigeria Football Federation, NFF, Alhaji Aminu Maigari, has revealed what a former FIFA President, Sepp Blatter once told him about Nigerian indigenous coaches. Coach Austine Eguavoen led the Super Eagles to the Round of 16 of the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon and were defeated by Tunisia. The Super Eagles lost following a fine performance by the team in the group stage where they beat Egypt, Sudan and Guinea Bissau. The Eagles were initially tipped to win and Maigari believed that the squad played attractive football at the tournament. “…They showed great form and character right for. the group games,” he told Complete Sports. “This goes to confirm my stand on Nigerian coaches. You remember when former FIFA President, Sepp Blatter, wrote to commend me for having the trust and faith in one of our own, (late) Stephen Keshi, to appoint him as Super Eagles coach. “Blatter did that twice. The second time was after our Nations Cup win in 2013 in South Africa. So, I believe Eguavoen did well. The solution to our football problems lies in our own hands. “Like Blatter said in his (second) commendation letter to me, it is only indigenous coaches that know their players’ character, mentality, the culture of the people and attitude. “They work with commitment, determination because they know that they don’t have any other country than theirs.” Up next for the Super Eagles is their World Cup qualifying playoff against Ghana in March. The NFF, now led by Amaju Pinnick, is expected to announce the next coach soon.
