Tottenham Hotspur are set to hijack Arsenal’s first January signing, Philippe Coutinho. Coutinho, who currently plays for Barcelona, is all but set to arrive at Arsenal after their manager Mikel Arteta gave the green light to pursue the deal. Coutinho’s representatives are traveling to London to conclude talks with Arsenal. But according to El Nacional, Tottenham could offer to take Coutinho off Barcelona’s hands. Antonio Conte’s side are considering trying to persuade the Catalan club to let the Brazilian join Spurs on a free transfer before the January window closes. However, it remains to be seen whether the Premier League side will be willing to match Coutinho’s current £370,000 per week wage. Coutinho has played in the Premier League before during his time at Liverpool. The 29-year-old left Liverpool in January 2018 to join Barcelona for £142 million. The playmaker has so far failed to meet expectations at Barcelona and has been blighted by injuries, constant changing of managers and a loss of form.
