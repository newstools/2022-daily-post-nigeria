The 64th Grammy Awards has been postponed indefinitely amid an unprecedented wave of COVID Omicron variant. Recording Academy announced that the awards was postponed indefinitely for safety reasons. The awards show had been scheduled for Jan. 31; no new date has been set yet. CBS and Recording Academy in a statement said holding the show on January 31 simply contains too many risks given the uncertainty surrounding the Omicron variant. Part of the statement read, “After careful consideration and analysis with city and state officials, health and safety experts, the artist community and our many partners, the Recording Academy and CBS have postponed the 64th Annual GRAMMY Awards Show.” CBS noted that the health and safety of those in our music community, the live audience, and those who tirelessly to produce the award show remains our top priority. “We look forward to celebrating Music’s Biggest Night® on a future date, which will be announced soon,” the statement read.
