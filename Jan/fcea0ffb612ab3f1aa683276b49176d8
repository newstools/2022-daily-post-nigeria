Arsenal’s top target, Dusan Vlahovic wants to join rivals Manchester City, according to La Repubblica. The striker is holding out for a move to City despite receiving an offer from Arsenal. The Gunners have made £50 million offer, plus Lucas Torreira to Fiorentina for the 21-year-old but his representives have refused to respond to the Gunners’ offer. Vlahovic’s representatives have also kept Fiorentina in the dark regarding the striker’s decision over his future. La Repubblica reports that Vlahovic ‘is in no hurry’ to make a decision over his next move but his ‘dream’ would be to move to Manchester City instead of Arsenal. Manchester City are said to be keeping tabs on the Serbia international’s situation also. Reports this week have claimed that Juventus have also entered the race to sign Vlahovic. Speaking to La Nazione this week, Fiorentina’s director Barone revealed: “Some English clubs have made contact, but there is no agreement yet. We are open [to selling] but there can’t be a deal unless someone [Vlahovic] agrees.” Following the banishment of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from their first team, Arsenal are looking for a star striker to replace the Gabonese, who is said to be on his way out of the Emirates Stadium.
