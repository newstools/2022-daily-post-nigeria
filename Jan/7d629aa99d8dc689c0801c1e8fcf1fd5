Everton is looking to sign Ruben Loftus-Cheek from Chelsea and he will potentially be Frank Lampard’s first signing, according to SportsMail. Lampard is set to make his return to the Premier League as manager, after being out of work for a year, following his sack from Stamford Bridge. Vitor Pereira appeared to be on course to take over from Rafa Benitez but Lampard is now the clear favourite to take the job at Goodison Park. Everton has already brought in Vitalii Mykolenko, Nathan Patterson and Anwar El Ghazi this month. But they are also keen to bring in Loftus-Cheek before the window closes on Monday. Juventus had also targeted Loftus-Cheek as a replacement for Arthur Melo, who is wanted by Arsenal but it is understood that Chelsea wants to keep the midfielder for the remainder of the season.
