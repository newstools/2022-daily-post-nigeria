President Muhammadu Buhari has pledged a fair deal for the Itsekiri people of Delta State. Buhari gave the assurance when he received the Olu of Warri Kingdom, HRM Tsola Emiko, Ogiame Atuwatse III. The traditional ruler and his chiefs were at the State House in Abuja on Wednesday. The Nigerian leader thanked the monarch for the visit and declared admiration for his patriotism. “I’ve taken note of your requests and will work on them as soon as politically possible”, he said. The Olu of Warri commended the President for sending a high-powered delegation to his coronation. He further pledged the loyalty of Itsekiri people to “one united Nigeria”. “We support your government’s aspiration to provide security and economic prosperity to all Nigerians, irrespective of tribe, creed or religion,” he said. Emiko raised issues including the under-utilization of the four ports in Warri, Koko, Sapele and Burutu; NDDC Board reconstitution; immortalization of Nigeria’s first Finance Minister, Festus Okotie-Eboh, and resuscitation of Ogidigben EPZ Project. On his entourage were chiefs Brown Mene, Oma Eyewuoma, Thomas Ereyitomi, Daniel Reyeju, Dere Awosika, and Mr Julius Rone.
