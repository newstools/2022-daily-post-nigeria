Gbagyi Villa, a community on the outskirts of the Kaduna metropolis, was last night attacked by suspected bandits on motorcycles, each carrying a rider and two others, killing a man, kidnapped his wife and others. There was no official statement from the authorities at the time of filing this report. A resident of the community told DAILY POST that those on motorcycles were later joined by several other bandits that sneaked into the community in the night from a riverside, moving stealthily like “monkeys.” According to the resident, “When they came into the community, people were running away but the man who looked like a vigilante stood and was attempting to make a call with something like a walkie talkie. The bandits shot the man on his head. He fell and died.” He alleged that apart from the deceased ‘s wife picked by the bandits, they also kidnapped over 10 residents of the community in an operation that lasted for over an hour.
