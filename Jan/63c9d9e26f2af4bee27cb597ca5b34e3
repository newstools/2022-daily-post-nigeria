The Kwara State Command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC, on Tuesday averted what could have resulted into a bloody ethnic showdown between Hausa and Yoruba at the popular Mandate Market in Ilorin, the state capital. DAILY POST gathered that there was palpable tension when an Hausa man allegedly stabbed a Yoruba man in the head and mouth as the two argued over sales of sugarcane. According to a statement signed by the spokesman of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC in the State Babawale Zaid Afolabi, it took the timely arrival of the NSCDC operatives and other security personnel to prevent what could have resulted into a bloody ethnic clash. Security has also been beefed up around the market premises to prevent any reprisal and possible breakdown of law and order. Spokesman of the defence corps, said “We got a distress call on Tuesday that there was a clash between Yoruba and Hausa at Mandate market and we quickly mobilized our men to the scene in order to prevent total breakdown of law and other.” Reports said trouble started when a Yoruba man reportedly bought a sugarcane worth N50 naira from one Hausa seller but found out that the sugarcane was not sweet. The Yoruba man’s request to change the sugarcane did not go down well with the Hausa man. The Hausa man allegedly stabbed the Yoruba man and this resulted in a free-for-all between Hausa and Yoruba inside the market. The Yoruba man who sustained minor knife injury was taken to the cottage hospital where he is responding to treatment. There is currently a large presence of security personnel in and around the market premises to prevent any form of reprisal or further breakdown of law and order. “The NSCDC Commandant in the state ,Iskilu Ayinla Makinde, has ordered 24 hours surveillance and presence of our armed plain cloth personnel around the market premises and all the flash points have also been identified and necessary actions have been taken,” the spokesman added.
