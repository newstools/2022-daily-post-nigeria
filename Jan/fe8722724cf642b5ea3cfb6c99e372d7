A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State, Funmilayo Olasehinde-Mustapha has disclosed that the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is going nowhere in the gubernatorial election slated for July 16. Mustapha, who made this known while featuring in a radio political programme in Osogbo on Monday, revealed that with the division in the PDP, the chances of it gaining victory during the gubernatorial election was doubtful, as the party does not have electoral appeal. According to her, “As things stand today in our dear State, the PDP is going nowhere in the coming election.” On why she left the PDP, the former council boss disclosed that the party as presently composed has lost the ideals of the founding fathers and is not the same as it was in 1998. She added that it was sad that the party in Osun State has lost its relevance, with the division and in-fighting getting deeper on a daily basis. While commenting on women participation in politics, the former legislator revealed that there were many constraints but the government could come to the rescue. “If the government can support women through a trust fund, it will give opportunities for those who are willing to serve people in one capacity or the other to venture into politics,” she stated. Mustapha, who is a former Special Adviser on Planning and Strategy, noted that since victory in the gubernatorial election was uncertain with the PDP, the people of the State cannot leave certainty for uncertainty.
