Former Nigeria coach, Gernot Rohr, is among the candidates under consideration to become the next Ghana head coach, according to Ghana Web. Milovan Rajevac was sacked after the Black Stars were eliminated from the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. Ghana finished bottom of their group, which had Comoros, Morocco and Gabon. It is the first time in their history they have failed to win at least one group stage match. The West Africans are now looking at Rohr, who managed the Super Eagles for five years. Rohr, who was sacked in December, guided Nigeria to the 2018 FIFA World Cup and a third-place finish at the 2019 AFCON finals. If he takes the Ghana job, his first competitive match will be against his former employers in the 2022 World Cup play-offs in March.
