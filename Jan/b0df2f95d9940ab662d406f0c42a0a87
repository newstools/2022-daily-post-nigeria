Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has described the birth of the Amotekun Corps in the state as timely, stressing that the move has made the state to be adjudged the most peaceful state in the country. According to the governor, no state can be termed as healthy if the security of lives and property of the citizens is prioritised. While emphasising that one of the parameters to measure a healthiness of a state is it security situation, Akeredolu said the Amotekun Corps has performed creditably well. The governor stated this on Tuesday at the Annual General Prayer Meeting with public servants for the first working day in the year 2022, held at the Governor’s Office premises, Akure, the state capital. While commending other security agencies in the state for their efforts at sustaining peace in the state, he said Amotekun Corps was been put in place to complement their efforts. “We salute the military, police, Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps and other paramilitary agencies for their efforts in sustaining the peace in our State. Let me reiterate for the umpteenth time that the Amotekun Corps has been put in place to complement their efforts. “It goes without saying that the successes and comportment of the Corps have demonstrated that the State Government had made no mistake in setting it up. It has equally helped to take several of our employable youths off the unemployment market.”
