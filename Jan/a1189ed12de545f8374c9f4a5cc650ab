Rochas Okorocha, Former Governor of Imo State, has insisted that Nigeria is passing through a difficult moment ahead of the 2023 general election. Okorocha also charged Nigerian leaders at all levels to begin to accept responsibilities, adding that despite the present challenge, the country is not finished. The Senator representing Imo South Senatorial District stated this on Friday, in Abuja, at an award organized by ‘Our Nigeria Magazine’ with the theme, “Nigeria is Our Nigeria: We Must Join Hands Together To Make It Work Or We Perish Together”. He said, “I have often said to our leaders at all levels that we must begin to accept responsibilities. There is absolutely nothing wrong with followers, but there can be something wrong with leadership. “As we approach the 2023 elections, I want to appeal to Nigerians to take a second look to address the mood of the nation right now and call for unity of this country. “We can dramatize this at all levels wherever we find ourselves be it as Muslims or Christians and in whatever religion or tribe you might find yourself. “What is happening to Nigeria is that we are passing through a difficult moment of our time to write the history of Nigeria, but a time shall come when other nations will see us as the greatest nation in the world,” he said.
