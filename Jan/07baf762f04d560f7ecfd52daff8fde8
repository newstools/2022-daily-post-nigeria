President Muhammadu Buhari has said that he does not expect Nigerians to appreciate him when he leaves office. President Buhari was elected into office in 2015, with a landslide victory over incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan. Since his administration took over in 2015, the Nigerian economy has been unstable, looking at it from the lens of experts, with prices of goods and services skyrocketing on a daily basis. But Buhari said Nigerians would come to realize he has done his best for them when he leaves Aso Rock in the next 17 months. Buhari said that he has seen it all as a governor, a minister, and a two-term President and has left behind structures that the citizens would reflect on. Speaking on his eagerness to hand over power in an interview aired on Nigerian Television Authority, NTA, on Thursday, Buhari said: “Yes, because, look, as you know I have been a governor. “I have been a minister and I’m in my second term as President. So, I have gone through the system. And really, what else can I do with this country? “I have given my best and I hope after I leave, Nigerians will reflect and at least not show appreciation. “I’m not expecting any appreciation. But what I’m expecting is for Nigerians to say yes, this man has done his best. “This is the most I’m expecting from Nigerians. But it’s no joke. I’m telling you.”
