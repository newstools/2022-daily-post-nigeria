Chairman of the Southwest Governors’ Forum and Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has described the passing of the Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Saliu Akanmu Adetunji, Aje Ogungunniso 1, as another tragedy in Yoruba land. While describing the death of the revered monarch as a rude shock, Akeredolu said it came shortly after the demise of Soun of Ogbomoso, Oba Jimoh Oyewumi, which he said was a big blow dealt on the traditional stool in Yoruba land Oba Adetunji, who was the 41st Olubadan, had in the early hours of Sunday given up the ghost at the University College Hospital, UCH, in Ibadan, Oyo State. Akeredolu in a condolence message issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Richard Olatunde on Sunday, said despite the Olubadan’s old age, he was a valuable asset to the people of Ibadan and the entire Yoruba race. While condoling with the Oyo State Government and indigenes of Ibadan, the governor emphasized that the late monarch did his best for the development and growth of Ibadan land. Stressing that the monarch’s legacies will speak for him, the Governor maintained that Oba Adetunji had gone to be with his ancestors. The Governor added that the monarch, who displayed royalty with a difference while he was alive, will be remembered for his firm stands, principles and love for his people.
