Iconic British journalist, Piers Morgan has named his top 10 sporting greatest of all times, GOATs. He snubbed Lionel Messi of Paris Saint-Germain and named Manchester United legend Cristiano Ronaldo as number five. Messi’s legendary exploits in the round-leather game put the 34-year-old as one of the best footballers ever seen. Messi has won seven Ballon d’Or awards, two ahead of on-pitch rival Ronaldo.
