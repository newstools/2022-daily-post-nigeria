The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has petitioned the Police Service Commission, demanding an immediate investigation into the invasion of a Christian worship centre in Imo State by some police operatives where Uche Nwosu, son-in-law to the former governor of the state, Rochas Okorocha, was arrested. According to a video that made the rounds on social media recently, the former Imo State governorship candidate was arrested by the police when the officers stormed St Peter’s Anglican Church, Eziama-Obaire in Nkwerre Local Government Area of the state while the service was ongoing. Mr Nwosu was whisked away from the church after minutes of sporadic shooting while he was attending his late mother’s thanksgiving service at the church. In the petition signed by its national coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko, and sighted by our correspondent, HURIWA prayed the Police Service Commission to identify the police operatives who did the “unthinkable and terrorist act of invading a Church and shooting sporadically right inside a well-populated Church”. The rights group also called on the commission to invite the officers, including the Imo State Police commissioner, for questioning over the issue. Below is a copy of the document.
