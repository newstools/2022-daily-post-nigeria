The Nigeria Police Force, on Thursday, debunked reports that its helicopter, Bell 429 5NMDA, flying from Abuja to Bauchi crashed on Tuesday. DAILY POST recalls many reports had claimed the aircraft, with registration 5N-MDA belonging to the police force, was involved in an accident in Bauchi State. A development the Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB) had confirmed saying it was notified by Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA). However, CP Frank Mba, Police Public Relations Officer, Force Headquarters, Abuja, maintained that none of the occupants sustained any injury whatsoever as earlier reported in the media, adding that the police helicopter was in controlled safe-landing in Bauchi. According to him, the aircraft, which was flown by one of the best police pilots, was professionally safe-landed with minor damage on the rear rotor as a result of an obstacle at the landing spot.
