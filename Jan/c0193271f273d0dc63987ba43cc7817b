Former Commissioner for Information in Edo State, Prince Kassim Afegbua, has told erstwhile Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar that the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, was not created for him alone. Afegbua described as immoral any move by Atiku to seek the PDP’s ticket for the 2023 presidential election having attained the retirement age. According to him, “’Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar cannot assume the role of a perpetual candidate or professional aspirant year in, year out, of the party as though the party was established for him alone,” he said in a statement he signed and made available to DAILY POST on Sunday. “It defeats all sense of logic for such an old man to attempt another round of political contestation at a time the general feeling and mood in the country supports a younger Nigerian from the Southern extraction of the country’’. Furthermore, Afegbua called on the former Vice president to shelve any plans to run for presidency again and throw his weight behind a candidate from the southern part of the country. Afebgua further pointed out that it will be against the run of play and natural justice for any aspirant of Northern extraction to show interest in the 2023 presidential election. His statement titled ‘’2023: Atiku and the age of Methuselah politics’’, the Edo State PDP chieftain pointed out that after the 2019 presidential election, Atiku abandoned the party and its members and sought refuge in far away Dubai, United Arab Emirates. ‘’It was a case of a General abandoning his troops in the battlefield. Rather than draw strength from his presence, his absence exposed us to all manner of challenges,” added.
