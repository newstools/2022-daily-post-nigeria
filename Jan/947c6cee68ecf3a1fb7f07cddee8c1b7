The General Manager of Western Sun Hotels, Ede, Osun State, Samuel Owolawi, has been arrested over attempted land grabbing, assault and malicious damage to property. It was gathered that Owolawi was arrested on Saturday after he allegedly led hoodlums and armed soldiers to demolish an ongoing building construction and beat up the workers. The workers, it was further alleged, were threatened, never to return to the site. Mutiu Tijani, the builder on the site, in a statement to the police accused Owolawi of leading the gang on the orders of a serving major general in the Nigerian Army and chairman of Western Sun Hotels Kamal Yusuf claimed that the general recently bought over the property from Ede North Local Government Area. Meanwhile, Osun police spokesperson, Yemisi Opalola, confirmed to newsmen that a report of malicious damage was reported at Police Division Ede. Opalola said the matter was a land ownership tussle and appealed to the parties involved to maintain peace while the police carry out further investigation into the matter.
