The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) is questioning 22 suspected oil thieves arrested in Port Harcourt, the Rivers capital. They were intercepted by the Nigerian Navy, along with vessel MT. TIS IV, over alleged illegal dealing in petroleum products. The suspects were apprehended by Nigerian Naval Ship (NNS) Soroh under Naval Base Camp Porbeni along Akassa Rivers in Bayelsa on December 6, 2021. The EFCC took the suspects into custody on January 7, 2022, a statement on Monday by the spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, said. Their names: Levi Jonathan, Eze Kenneth, Enemari Peter James, Sunday Ereku, Emmanuel Ogbonna, Timi Amos, Fatai Kareem, Chuks Egbo, Tony Atawo and Saviour Martin. Others are Yoosu Alex, Isac Iboro, Bassey Okon, Kingsley Edet, Taye Poto, Saturday Sobere, Alfred Atiemie, Owei Ibolo, Felix Onome, Odus Osita, Etim Edet and Mudashird Tarheed. Navy Commander P. E. Effah handed them over to the EFCC. He recalled that at the time of arrest, the vessel was laden with about 700,000 litres of product believed to be illegally sourced crude oil. “Both the vessel and the suspects were remanded at Brass for safekeeping and preliminary investigations”, Effah said. An EFCC Assistant Superintendent, Anthony Mark, thanked the Navy and promised a diligent probe and possible prosecution of persons found culpable.
