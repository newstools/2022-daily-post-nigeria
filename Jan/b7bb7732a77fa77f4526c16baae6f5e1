Journalists in Plateau State have joined the state’s peacebuilding agency to brainstorm on ways to entrench permanent peace in troubled communities in the state. The Plateau Peace Building Agency during interaction with newsmen emphasised the need for responsive reportage towards achieving peace. They took the stand at a media engagement organised to assess the involvement of journalists in the Peace Building process of Plateau State. In his address, the Director-General PPBA, Mr. Joseph Lengmang, said, “This media engagement is important because of the role journalists play in agenda-setting and shaping opinions regarding policies and in the area of peace and conflict. “This interaction is therefore meant to share experiences and draw lessons as well as advise each other as they continue their duties of reporting conflict. In his address, the Director-General described journalists as “Ambassadors of peace” whose contributions should not be ignored. He said peace cannot be achieved except all actors are ready to accept it. In his remarks, veteran journalist, Mr. Yakubu Taddy insisted that journalists in Plateau State are doing well. Taddy, who is the Director of News and Current Affairs, Plateau Radio Television Corporation, called for continuous synergy between the PPBA and journalists to help it achieve its desired objectives of ensuring peaceful coexistence among the citizenry. Also speaking, a former chairman of the Correspondent Chapel of the NUJ in the State, Mr. Yemi Kosoko, said, “Both journalists and the Agency have a great role to play in ensuring peace in the State. Bulus Gambo, another journalist, emphasised that it is the duty of newsmen to ensure the unity of the country through their reportage.
