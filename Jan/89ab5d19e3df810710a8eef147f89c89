A fire outbreak at Danbushiya community, Igabi local government area of Kaduna State has killed a young boy and inflicted grievous injuries on his siblings. Details of what caused the fire outbreak remains sketchy as residents said they only saw smoke coming out of the house around 10pm on Sunday night. DAILY POST gathered that parents of the children were not home when the fire broke out at the family house. The two injured minors are presently at Barau Dikko General Teaching Hospital, Kaduna where they are receiving treatment. Malam Ibrahim, a resident of the community explained that all efforts made by those who went to the affected house to rescue the child from the fire failed. ”What happened was terrible, “We tried our best to break the door since their parents were not at home at the time of the fire incident but we couldn’t enter because the door was locked. Fortunately, the two siblings were rescued through the window.”
He explained that all the people could hear was the deceased were screaming for help, lamenting that they could do anything to help him as the fire had gutted the room. DAILY POST also learned that when the parents of the children returned and learned of the incident, they fainted out of shock and were also rushed to a hospital that night.
