A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Prince Kassim Afegbua, has tackled Atiku Abubakar, a former Vice President, over his presidential ambition. Afegbua said Atiku should not be a professional and perpetual presidential candidate. The former spokesman for the Atiku Abubakar presidential campaign organization spoke on Channels Television’s Politics Today on Tuesday. Afegbua recalled how the former PDP presidential candidate started contesting from 2011 till 2019 under different political platforms. “The point is that in 2023, I don’t want Alhaji Atiku Abubakar to be a professional aspirant or a perpetual candidate in every election. “He contested in 2011 with one party; he left. When he was vice-president, he also ran under another party. He was in APC; he left APC. We are both in the PDP. “He contested in 2019; that was the best outing. He put up a good effort and we lost the election,” he said. Atiku, known for his aspirations to govern Nigeria, lost to President Muhammadu Buhari in the last presidential election.
