Former Nigeria international, Jonathan Akpoborie, has backed the Super Eagles to beat Tunisia when both teams clash in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) Round of 16 tie on Sunday night. Akpoborie also urged Super Eagles strikers, Taiwo Awoniyi and Umar Sadiq, to be clinical in front of goal against Tunisia. He called on Augustine Eguavoen’s men not to allow Tunisia to score first because of their antics. Nigeria had won all their matches in the group stage, while Tunisia won one and lost two matches. “I’m really impressed with the performance of the Super Eagles at the ongoing AFCON tournament. However, I’m really worried with the way our strikers are wasting goal-scoring opportunities,” Jonathan told Completesports. “We have gotten to a stage where few goal-scoring opportunities that are converted may count for the team. The duo of Awoniyi and Sadiq must be ready to bury all the chances that come their way against Tunisia. “We must not also allow the Tunisians to score first against us because of their antics. We have the players to get the job done and I believe Nigeria will overcome them.” The kick-off time for Nigeria vs Tunisia game is 8 pm.
