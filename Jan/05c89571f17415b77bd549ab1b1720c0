Manchester United legend, Paul Scholes, has told manager, Ralf Rangnick, to always play ‘brilliant’ Mason Greenwood ahead of club’s hero, Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo has scored 14 goals in 21 appearances since he made a sudden return to Manchester United last summer. The former Real Madrid’s frontman’s return dragged Greenwood down the club’s pecking order for strikers. But club’s legend, Scholes feels the young talent should still be starting as he is the ‘future’ of the club. Greenwood, 20, has only started 13 league games this season and has often been used in a wide role “Mason Greenwood is a brilliant player – great potential,” Scholes told Webby and O’Neill YouTube channel. “The manager keeps taking him off, he’s almost become a little bit of a scapegoat, a little bit of an easy target because he’s a young player. “He should be playing up front for this team. As good as [Cristiano] Ronaldo and [Edinson] Cavani are, and have been throughout their careers, for Manchester United’s centre forwards to be 37 and 34 just tells us where the club is at. “Greenwood has to be playing now – and in the future. He is a highly-talented lad and I’m frustrated when I watch him because you know he’s going to be the first man off every single time.” Ronaldo and Cavani have been leading the line for Ralf Rangnick in recent matches and would hope to keep their places in the XI. Ronaldo was dropped from Manchester United’s squad that defeated Aston Villa 1-0 in the FA Cup on Monday.
