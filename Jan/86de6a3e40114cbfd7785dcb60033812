President Muhammadu Buhari has condoled with victims of the fire incident at Main Market and Relief Market in Onitsha, Anambra State. This was contained in a statement by the president’s spokesman, Mr Femi Adesina, on Friday in Abuja. Recall that firefighters on Friday battled to put out a raging fire caused by a fallen petrol tanker in the state. The fire reportedly destroyed several goods. A source told DAILY POST that the fire started after a petrol tanker conveying fuel fell around Obodoukwu road, along the Onitsha-Owerri road in the commercial city. Reacting, Buhari directed Federal Government agencies working with the Anambra government to give the necessary succour to victims. He also urged public-spirited individuals and corporate organisations to assist those whose means of livelihood had been affected by the unfortunate incident.
