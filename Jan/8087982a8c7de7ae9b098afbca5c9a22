The Kano State tricycles’ union has urged its members to return to work. The Chairman of the association in Kano State, Alhaji Sani Sa’idu Dan Koli, confirmed this to newsmen. According to him “the new directive is following the order of the Kano State House of Assembly and the DSS. “DSS has informed us that tomorrow at 10am we will hear good news, so from now on, any member can go out to continue with their business.” He also assured the tricycle operators that their problems would soon come to an end. The tricycle operators had on Monday embarked on a 7-day industrial action in protest of the N8,000 permit directed by the Kano State Government. The situation left passengers stranded, forcing many to trek to their destinations. Meanwhile, the Kano State Government has said there is no going back on the new directive.
