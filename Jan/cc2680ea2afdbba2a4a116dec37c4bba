A mother of three, Olamide Lawal, on Friday prayed a Grade ‘A’ Customary Court in Mapo, Ibadan, Oyo State, to grant her divorce. Olamide’s grounds is that the husband, Saheed Lawal, engages her with too much sex. NAN reports that the applicant, an Ibadan resident, also accused her husband of being a drunk. Disclosing they’ve been married for 14 years, she called Saheed a man with “no human kindness in him”. ”He devotes his time to beer consumption, beating and forcing me to have sex with him. He does not provide for my children.” She pleaded for an order restraining Saheed from calling her phone or visiting her apartment. Responding, the defendant apologized for his actions and promised to turn a new leaf. ”I have stopped drinking alcohol. I am ready to start giving the children feeding money”, the fashion designer assured. Mrs. S. M. Akintayo, President of the Court adjourned the matter until March 1 for judgment.
