Former Ghanaian international, Asamoah Gyan, has revealed the Black Stars player that has really impressed him at the ongoing 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON. Gyan said Ghana winger, Kamaldeen Sulemana, has impressed him at the 2021 AFCON in Cameroon, adding that he hopes the 19-year-old Rennes star continues his good form. The 36-year-old said this ahead of Ghana’s 2021 AFCON final group C fixture against Comoros on Tuesday night. “Everybody is doing well and in top shape and in tournaments you can be a star but for this current Ghanaian team the man who has really impressed me is Kamaldeen from Rennes,” Gyan told CAF Online. “I hope he continues his form in the AFCON and not forgetting Daniel Amartey he has done so well in his last few games.” Gyan is Ghana’s all-time top scorer with 51 goals and the most capped player (109 appearances).
