Paris Saint-Germain forward, Lionel Messi, will miss their trip to Lyon on Sunday. Messi will be unavailable for the Ligue 1 clash as he continues his recovery from COVID-19. The 34-year-old has returned to France from Argentina after returning a negative result but is still not cleared to play. “Lionel Messi will continue his post-COVID individual protocol in the coming days,” PSG said in a statement. PSG also confirmed Angel Di Maria, Julian Draxler, Danilo Pereira, Gianluigi Donnarumma and Layvin Kurzawa are all still isolating after testing positive. “It’s always hard to pick the right team, COVID or no COVID,” PSG coach Mauricio Pochettino told a news conference on Saturday. Pochettino’s men are top of the table with 46 points from 19 games, 10 ahead of second-placed Marseille.
