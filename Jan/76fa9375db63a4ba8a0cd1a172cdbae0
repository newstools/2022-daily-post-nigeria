Kaduna State Zonal Command of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on Wednesday, January 12, 2022, arraigned one Mohammed Sani Dàuda alongside his company, MS Seven Nigeria Limited, before Justice Darius Khobo of Kaduna State High Court on a two count charge bordering on obtaining by false pretence. Dauda was arrested by the EFCC following a petition alleging that sometime in August, 2021, he approached the complainant, claiming that he was into the importation of luxury cars from the United States of America. He convinced the complainant to patronize him. The petitioner subsequently deposited the sum of N70, 000,000 (Seventy Million Naira) into the company account of the defendant, for the purchase of a Mercedes Benz S-class 2021 model. After a while, the complainant said he again paid another N 194,128,500.00 (One Hundred and Ninety Four Million, One Hundred Twenty Eight Thousand Five Hundred Naira) into the defendant’s company’s account domiciled in another bank for the purchase of a Mercedes Benz G-Wagon and a Rolls Royce. He further stated that after the payments were made, the defendant became evasive and efforts to reach him to either get the vehicles requested or have a refund became futile.
