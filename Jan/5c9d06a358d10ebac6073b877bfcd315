A man has reportedly killed his wife in Adamawa State and made an arrangement for other women to bury her. The Adamawa State Police Command confirmed Sunday that the man, 42-year-old Muhammad Sambo of Sorau Belel in Maiha Local Government Area of Northern Adamawa, was arrested for allegedly killing his wife, Fadimatu Sambo. The police traced the incident to late last year in Belel, and local sources said Sambo murdered the wife and was planning a secret burial using women when he was discovered and arrested. Muhammad was brought before a Chief Magistrates Court in Yola, the state capital, on Friday, and was thereafter remanded in prison custody by Chief Magistrate Mohammed Digil. The First Information Report (FIR) on the case indicates that one Jauro Sale of Sorau Belel reported the crime to the police. According to the FIR, “Jauro Saleh told the police that late Fadimatu was found lying uncounscious in her bedroom with her head in a pool of blood, with marks of violent attacks around the head and entire body. “He narrated to the police that when the victim was rushed to a hospital for medical attention, she was certified dead by a medical doctor. Investigation led to the arrest of the husband.” Sambo has however denied killing his wife, insisting that he was not even at home at the time of the incident. Against such defence, the police prosecutor, Ahmed Abubakar, said members of the neighbourhood were insistent there was something fishy in him making moves for a secret burial for Fadimatu. The case was adjourned to February 16.
