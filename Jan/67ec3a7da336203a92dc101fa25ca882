Super Eagles striker, Odion Ighalo, has confirmed his move to Al Hilal from Al Shabab. Ighalo, writing on his verified Twitter page, said: “Thank You @AlShababSaudiFC it was a Pleasure.” The former Watford and Manchester United man has agreed a deal with Al Hilal until June 2023. The 32-year-old is joining the Blue Waves for an undisclosed fee. “Welcome the ‘Eagle’, Odion Ighalo,” the tweet from Al Hilal read, accompanied by a graphic image of the Nigerian in his club’s colour. Ighalo joined Al Shabab in February 2021, after signing a two-and-a-half-year deal. The Saudi Arabian side had blocked the striker from representing Nigeria at the ongoing 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. Super Eagles interim coach, Austin Eguavoen, then claimed the Confederation of African Football (CAF) blocked him from calling up a replacement for the player.
