Nigerian Grammy award-winning singer, Burna Boy, has stated that he wants a physical fight with Shatta Wale and not a freestyle battle in Ghana. Shatta Wale had challenged Burna Boy to a freestyle battle while insisting that Nigerian artistes are nothing without Ghana. However, Burna Boy on his Instagram story made it clear that he wants a fist battle like real men do. According to the ‘Odogwu’ crooner, he wants Shatta Wale to consider the challenge as an easy way out as he could make his life outside Ghana a living hell. On his Instagram post he wrote, “This guy thinks I have time this ain’t 8mile no be rap battle, it’s a fist battle the type real men do. “We can do it anywhere you want behind closed doors or in the stadium for everyone to see. Stop acting like you don’t know I’ve been trying to set this up since January last year. “Consider this an easy way out for you because I could easily make your life a living hell anywhere you go outside Ghana. You know I have money than all your Godfathers combined. [sic]”
