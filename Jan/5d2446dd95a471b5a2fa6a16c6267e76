The Rivers State Government has explained why it intends to access the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) COVID-19 support fund for states across the federation. The state government said the fund will enable it to establish a world-class radiotherapy centre and department at the Dr. Peter Odili Cancer and Cardiovascular Treatment and Diagnostic Centre in Port Harcourt, the state capital. The state Commissioner for Finance, Issac Kamalu, gave the explanation at the end of the state executive council meeting presided over by Governor Nyesom Wike at the Government House on Thursday. The commissioner added that the CBN created the fund to cushion the effects of coronavirus on the federal and state governments. Kamalu noted that “the N2.5 billion is structured into two components. N2 billion will be for healthcare infrastructure support and N500 million as revolving credit for medical consumables. “As you are aware, the facility has been utilised by virtually all the States and Rivers State is among the few that are yet to utilise the facility. “So, the government has, in its wisdom, thought it necessary that this facility should be accessed so that members of the public, as well as those living in the state, can utilise the outcome of this in terms of medical service provision.” He also added that parts of the money will be used to upgrade healthcare facilities at the Prof. Kesley Harrison Hospital and the Dental and Maxillofacial Hospital in Port Harcourt. Earlier at the meeting, the state executive council approved the construction of the 10th flyover in the state which is expected to cost about N8.2 billion. According to the Commissioner for Works, Eloka Tasie Amadi, the project, which will be located at the Rumukwurushi-Elimgbu axis of Obio Akpor Local Government Area of the state, is to be completed within 12 months.
