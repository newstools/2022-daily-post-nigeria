The Director-General of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), Dr. Salihu Lukman has accused the Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) of manipulating the party’s decision as regards the February date fixed for the national convention. He said the party needed leaders that would really be sincere and uphold the trust invested in them. Lukman stated this Tuesday in Abuja while giving a keynote address at the APC Stakeholders Summit, organised by the APC Rebirth Group with the theme; “Rebuilding the APC of our Dreams.” He was of the view that the party needed leaders that would respect the decisions of other members of the party. Lukman stated: “It amounts to disrespect when a leader who is supposed to implement a decision jointly taken refused to do so. If there is a decision, leaders should implement such decisions very faithfully; we don’t want leaders that will claim to know better than people who took a decision. “That is the problem we are having in the party now, when decisions are taken that do not suit leaders, they try to manipulate such decisions and ensure that such decisions were not implemented. “That is why we are where we are, a decision is clearly taken that February 5th will be the date for the party`s National Convention and somebody will sit down and he is manipulating. We cannot have a political party that disrespects decisions. APC is becoming unattractive.” The Director-General noted that the party does not want leaders who would claim to know better than those who took decisions at meetings, saying this is the problem the party is currently having. Lukman added that if the party was struggling to hold its national convention; it should begin to think about how it would manage the process that would produce candidates for the 2023 general elections.
