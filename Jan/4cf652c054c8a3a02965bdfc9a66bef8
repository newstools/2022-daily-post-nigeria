Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar was in Katsina State on Saturday for a condolence visit. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 2019 presidential candidate visited the family of Dahiru Mangal, a business magnate Hajiya Murja Bara’u, the 85-year-old mother of the tycoon, passed away on Thursday and was buried on Friday. Atiku prayed that “Almighty Allah will comfort the family and grant her Aljannah Firdaus in paradise”. He posted photos of interactions with Senate President, Ahmad Lawan; Yobe Governor, Mai Buni; and Katsina Governor, Aminu Masari. Mangal is bereaved for the second time in less than a year. His son, Nura, died in March 2021 in a bike accident. Regarded as Katsina’s richest man, Mangal is the Chairman of Afdin Group, owners of Max Air, Afdin Petroleum, Afdin Construction, among others.
