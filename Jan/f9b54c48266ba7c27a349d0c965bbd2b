The Commissioner of Police in Rivers State, CP Friday Eboka has said the State Police Command is yet to receive the list of the 19 persons declared wanted by Governor Nyesom Wike for alleged involvement in oil bunkery activities. The comments by the Commissioner came a day after the Governor had announced that the details of those declared wanted had been “passed” to the police. The Governor, who reeled out the names of the wanted persons, directed them to report to the State Police Command immediately. But answering questions from journalists on Monday, the CP said the command was yet to receive the details of the wanted persons. He, however, assured that the 19 persons would be arrested as soon as their names were made available to the command. “Actually I heard over the news that some people have been declared wanted by the State Government. We are still expecting to get the list from the government so we can work on them. “We don’t act on what we hear on the radio. By the time we get the list, we will go after them and I want to assure you that they will be arrested and prosecuted if we have evidence to prosecute them”, he said. Meanwhile, the Commissioner also paraded 18 persons who were arrested in different parts of the State for their alleged involvement in oil bunkery activities. Speaking during their parade at the State Police headquarters, the CP advised those involved in the illegal bunkering to “stay away from it”.
