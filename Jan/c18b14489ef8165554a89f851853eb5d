Bola Tinubu, a presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has met with former Military Head of State, Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida, IBB. Tinubu met with Babangida on Thursday afternoon in Minna, the Niger State capital. He arrived at IBB’s hilltop residence at about 2.30pm and both went straight into a meeting behind closed-door. The meeting is not unconnected with Tinubu’s aspiration to run for the presidency in 2023. Tinubu visits Babangida after similar moves to some influential power blocs and individuals across the country. He had last week cleared the air over doubts of him running for the presidency in 2023. The APC National Leader had informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his intentions to run for the Presidency in 2023.
