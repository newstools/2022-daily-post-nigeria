A High Court in Abia State, on Wednesday, ordered the Federal Government to pay the sum of N1 billion to the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Nnamdi Kanu. The court also ordered the government to issue a letter of apology to the secessionist for allegedly violating his fundamental human rights. Kanu’s lawyer, Aloy Ejimakor, made this known in a tweet, saying, “Mazi Nnamdi Kanu wins as Abia High Court rules that the Federal Government violated his fundamental rights, orders the Federal government to pay N1b to him and issue a letter of apology to him. “Most importantly, the court recommended political solution to the #Biafran agitation.”
