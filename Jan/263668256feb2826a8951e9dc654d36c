The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has called for the resignation of Zamfara State Governor, Bello Muhammad Matawalle over his alleged inability to secure the lives of citizens of the state. The rights group made the call in a statement on Saturday while reacting to the killing of over 200 villagers in Anka and Bukkuyum local government areas of the state by fleeing bandits. It was earlier gathered that the bandits, who were fleeing as a result of ongoing military operations, were trying to leave the state with a large number of animals when they attacked some villages in the two local government areas, killing over 200 people in the process. The attacked villages include Rafin Danya, Barayar Zaki, Rafin Gero and Kurfa. An indigene of the area, who gave his name as Mohammed Kurfa, told newsmen that he was in his village when the bandits arrived and launched the unfortunate attacks. An eyewitness, Mr Kurfa told journalists that the assailants invaded the scenes with over 3,000 cattle and were trying to leave the state when members of a vigilante group tried to engage them in a gun battle. He stated, “When they were seen approaching the village, the vigilante group members came out to defend the people of the village, but they were overpowered by the bandits, who were moving in large numbers. “They killed many of the vigilante group members and also set the village on fire”. According to HURIWA, if these killings happened in a humane and civilised society and not a “primitive cave-like Nigeria, the Inspector General of Police would have either resigned, dismissed by the President or arrested and prosecuted for dereliction of duty”. The group, however, regretted that President Muhammadu Buhari “enjoys incompetence and show of shame from his appointees”.
