Former national chairman of All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, Senator Victor Umeh and the incumbent senator representing Anambra Central zone, Senator Uche Ekwunife will in 2023 lock horns in a Senatorial contest. The election would be the third time Umeh and Ekwunife would be challenging each other in an election. The indication that Umeh would contest the election emerged yesterday when some groups within the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Anambra State called on Umeh to contest for a seat in the Senate. Meanwhile, Ekwunife has also indicated that she would contest next year’s election. Her media aide, Kingsley Ubani who was reacting to calls on Umeh to run said Ekwunife would also run and the election would be the third time both heavyweight politicians would be meeting in a contest.
