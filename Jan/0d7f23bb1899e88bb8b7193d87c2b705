The Kaduna State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has expressed concerns over the killing of a herder in Kaduna, leading to a renewed circle of killings. According to CAN, “The development is tragic, therefore, CAN appeal to citizens and all stakeholders to join hands to bring to a stop this new wave of killings.” Rev. John Joseph Hayab, Kaduna State CAN chairman, in a statement titled, “Killings in Kaduna must stop”, lamented that the state has been on the news for banditry, kidnapping, assaults on communities and killings of innocent citizens, saying, “This evil must stop now and those keeping quiet need to speak up forthwith.” He noted that the present generation cannot pass this type of record to the next, stressing that when others are struggling to come out of poverty to be self-reliant, Kaduna is grappling with killings at every slightest provocation. Rev. Hayab emphasized, “Our faith and culture do not teach us a barbaric manner of setting conflicts. We should, therefore, strengthen our love for one another and value the sanctity of human life.” According to him, all must resolve that no life should be sacrificed from now henceforth in the state irrespective of the identity of victims. He assured that CAN is willing to work with all peace-loving individuals, groups and organisations to bring back the lost glory of Kaduna State and uphold the sanctity of human life in every part of the country.
