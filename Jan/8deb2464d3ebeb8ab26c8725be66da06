Troops of the Special Task Force, Operation Safe Haven (OPSH), have neutralized three notorious kidnappers in Jos, the Plateau State capital. Maj. Ishaku Takwa, media officer of the task force, in a statement made available on Friday in Jos, said the criminal gang, which has been on the watchlist of the military, is believed to be behind all the recent kidnapping activities in Jos and environs.
