The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arrested Oluwasegun Bolarinwa, a fake Army General, for alleged N270million fraud. The suspect, who posed as a Nigerian Army General, allegedly made false representations to the complainant, Kodef Clearing Resources. He claimed President Muhammadu Buhari shortlisted him and one other to become Chief of Army Staff (COAS) and that he needed a short grant “to press and process the appointment.” Bolarinwa allegedly forged a letter of appointment as COAS purportedly signed by Buhari and showed the same to the victim. The suspect lied that he was expected to pay a certain amount of money into the coffers of the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN). Bolarinwa was arrested at his house in the Alagbado area of Lagos on Wednesday, January 12, 2022. Six pump action guns, three cartridge bullets, a swagger stick and several forged documents were recovered from him. EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, noted that Bolarinwa will be charged to court after full investigation.
