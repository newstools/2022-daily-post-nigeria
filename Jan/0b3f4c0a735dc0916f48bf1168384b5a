Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, has disclosed that he has formally informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his intention to run for All ProgressiveS Congress (APC) ticket for the 2023 presidential election. This is coming barely 24 hours after former Lagos State Governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, declared his ambition to contest for the presidential ticket as well. The governor, who said the President advised him to consult widely, said he was not perturbed by Tinubu’s entry into the race as he believes that the contest is not about might. Umahi, who left the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the APC in 2021, reiterated his earlier stance that the former ruling party was not ready to cede the 2023 ticket to the southeast, adding that he stands a chance if the APC throws the ticket open. He said if he gets the opportunity, his presidency will replicate his efforts in Ebonyi State at the national level, saying that he has a lot to show in running governance as business. The Ebonyi Governor said he supports a political solution to the insecurity problems in the South East, noting that economic activities of the region have been greatly impacted.
