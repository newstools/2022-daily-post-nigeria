Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle of Zamfara State has commended President Muhamadu Buhari for granting multiple requests for deployment of military operatives and installation of military infrastructure across the state. By extension, the governor expressed gratitude to the gallant security personnel for the incredible victories they have recorded recently against bandits on numerous fronts. The Governor disclosed this when he swore in Dr. Sulaiman Shu’aibu Shinkafi and Hon. Anas Abdullahi Kaura as Special Advisers to his cabinet. The governor charged the new Special Advisers to demonstrate the sublime virtues of devotion, diligence, and excellent leadership in order to realise the grandeur needed for the state and bring the prosperity the people in the state so direly need. Governor Matawalle also made it very clear that absolute loyalty, honesty, and commitment to duty are required of the new Special Advisers at all times, stressing that people will be watching their actions with keen interest and much expectation, especially now that we are in the new media age. The governor equally expressed gratitude to the authorities of Niger Republic, with whom a good working relationship in finding solutions to banditry in the state and other states in the northwest is yielding positive results.
