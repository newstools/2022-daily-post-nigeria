Youths attack Ebubeagu and everyone implicated in the recent gruesome murder of someone in Akaeze. Nnaogo Akpoke Anyim was murdered yesterday 18/01/2022 by the members of Ebubeagu security outfit in Akeze ivo LGA, Ebonyi State. “Ebubeagu operatives killed a youth in the area. The Akaeze youths after their meeting went peacefully to the Chairman of Ivo to ask him to assist them in producing the killer of the victim. “The practice by the youth is a normal thing but the chairman escalated the incident, which led to the youths taking laws into their hands. As it stands now, the military has taken over the community in order to maintain law and order.” When contacted, the State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Loveth Odah, promised to call the Divisional Police Officer, DPO, Ivo LGA and will make a detailed statement on the matter.
