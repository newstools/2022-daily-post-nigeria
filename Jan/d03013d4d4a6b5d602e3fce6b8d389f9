The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) on Monday, said it has banned the registration of alcoholic drinks in sachets, small volumes and glass bottles below 200 millimetres. This was disclosed in a statement on Monday by the Director-General of the agency, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye. She said the move followed the recommendation of a committee consisting of the Federal Ministry of Health, NAFDAC, and the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) in December 2018. She said the agency will ensure that the validity of renewal of already registered alcoholic products in the affected category does not exceed the year 2024. The NAFDAC DG said the Association of Food, Beverages and Tobacco Employers (AFBTE), and Distillers and Blenders Association of Nigeria (DIBAN) are also members of the committee. She explained that manufacturers of low volume alcoholic beverages (200ml), with satisfactory laboratory reports already submitted to NAFDAC for registration before the decision, have been directed to reformulate their products to stipulated standards free of charge. The statement said the agency is committed to the strict implementation of the regulations and regulatory measures towards safeguarding the health of Nigerians, particularly the vulnerable youths, against the dangers of reckless consumption of alcohol. She revealed that Distillers and Blenders were also given marching orders to embark on intensive nationwide sensitization campaigns against underage consumption of alcohol by adolescents below the age of 18 years in a bid to stem the tide of alcohol abuse in the country. She added that the producers of alcohol in sachets and small volumes agreed to reduce production by 50 per cent with effect from January 31st, 2022 while ensuring the products are completely phased out in the country by 31st January 2024.
