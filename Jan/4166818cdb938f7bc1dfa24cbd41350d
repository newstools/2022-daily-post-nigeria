Commercial motorcycle operators, otherwise known as Okada riders, have fully returned to Kano streets, despite the state government’s ban on their activities in eight local government areas of the state, as Adaidaita Sahu (keke napep) strike bites harder. DAILY POST gathered that a sizable number of Okada riders popularly known as Achaba in local parlance are seen offering quick services to customers early morning and late night in some major streets and in the neighbourhood. Governor Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso administration had in 2013 at the wake of attack on the Emir of Kano, Ado Bayero by suspected Boko Haram members, restricted Okada riders’ activities and directed them to vacate Kano streets by 6pm and must not carry passengers within the metropolitan councils. Sequel to the development, residents that witnessed several killings allegedly masterminded by Boko Haram members, on motorbikes had expressed concerns. Malam Bala Dan’azumi told DAILY POST that “we are worried by the gradual return of Achaba riders in Kano streets, especially within the neighbourhood where it has become a pastime for them to carry out their nefarious activities.” He said the government should do all it could to flout its own transportation system that will reduce sufferings of the masses in the wake of the Adaidaita Sahu strike actions. Similarly, Sani Dadungure worried that many of those riding Okada who are now gradually replacing the Adaidaita Sahu riders, are not known faces and this is coming when there are problems of kidnappings and other serious crimes in the state. All efforts to speak to both security and government officials on the return of Okada riders on the streets of Kano were fruitless.
