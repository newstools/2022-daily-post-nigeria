Bishop David Oyedepo of Living Faith Church, on Sunday, said God can pick Nigeria’s next president from his church. Oyedepo made the remark while noting that God can pick a female president from Living Faith Church. He spoke during a sermon at the church’s headquarters in Ota, Ogun State on Sunday. The clergyman urged these members aspiring for political positions to always seek counsel. According to Oyedepo: “And it is important for me to mention to members of the church because another time is here now. You better ask counsel of the priest before you torment your life by yourself. “What office will you win election to that I will now need you? No. My eternal helper is up there, and they know if I have ever asked a thing of anyone. Allow God to lead you. Don’t let greed and avarice lead you. “Don’t get me wrong, God can pick a president from this church. That President could even be a female.”
