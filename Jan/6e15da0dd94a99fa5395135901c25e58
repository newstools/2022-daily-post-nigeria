An Ikeja High Court on Monday ordered the Nigerian Navy to pay the entitlements of ex-Military Administrator of Lagos and Imo, the late Rear Adm. Ndubuisi Kanu. Justice Christopher Balogun ordered the payment into a dedicated interest-yielding account, News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports. The judge gave the order in a suit filed by one of the spouses, Mrs Gladys Kanu, asking the Navy to calculate her husband’s entitlements and pay. In the suit marked LD/3685FPM/2021, Gladys seeks to be declared as the sole widow of the former MILAD. She wanted an order of the court to declare that she is the only woman legally married to the late Kanu. The claimant said the deceased and her co-habited, and were married for 27 years. They had been together for 31 years. Respondents are Nigerian Navy and children of the late officer – Kelly Kanu, Simone Abiona (nee Kanu) and Andrey Joe- Ezigbo (nee Kanu). The rest are Paula Ndidiamaka Kanu, Karen Johnson (nee Kanu), Jeffery Kanu, Laura Kanu and Stephen Kanu. Two other wives, Josephine Ndubuisi-Kanu and Christine Kanu are respondents as well. Navy counsel, C. G. Cirbam, told the court that she filed an application to remove the military unit as a respondent since Kanu has been buried. Gladys counsel, O. Owoh, opposed on the grounds that the Navy is holding the entitlements of the deceased. Ndubuisi Kanu died January 2021 at age 78 after an illness. He hailed from Ugwunta in lsuikwuato Local Government of Abia State.
