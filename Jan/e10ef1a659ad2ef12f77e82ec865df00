Denmark midfielder, Christian Eriksen, is close to sealing a sensational return deal to the Premier League this week, the UK Times reports. Eriksen has not played football since suffering a cardiac arrest while representing his country against Finland at Euro 2020. The 29-year-old is now a free agent after his contract at Inter Milan was terminated. Eriksen cannot play in Italy with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. However, he has been approached by a few top-flight clubs in the EPL and could return to England this week. Eriksen played for Tottenham between 2013 and 2020, scoring 69 times in 305 appearances and providing 90 assists. Spurs boss, Antonio Conte, has already said he was welcome back at the club.
