The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has charged President Muhammadu Buhari to employ all available means to eliminate banditry and terrorism from the country. The APC chieftain said he will not relent in his support for the President until he succeeds in cracking the nut. With reference to a Yoruba proverb, he said, “It’s not easy to get to the seed of a palm kernel without a cracker. We will continue to pray with you to conquer the evil of sudden kidnapping, maiming and killing of innocent lives.” Tinubu was in Katsina on Sunday to condole with the State Governor, Aminu Masari, over the assassination of Dr Rabe Nasir, Commissioner for Science and Technology. In his words, “We are here only to grieve on the wicked assassination of the Honourable Commissioner of Science and Technology, Dr Rabe Nasir.” Tinubu said he was informed by the Katsina Governor, that “the late Rabe Nasir was one of the most reliable and resourceful individuals of Katsina State with a very broad knowledge of Nigeria as a country.” While sharing in their grief, Tinubu urged people in the state to have strong faith in God, noting that “evil men may interfere and try to tempt Allah, but He is the giver and He is the taker.” Governor Masari in his remark thanked the APC chieftain for making out time to come down to the state to sympathize with the people of the state.
