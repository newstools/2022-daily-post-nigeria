The Leader Of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, on Sunday, lambasted the Ghanaian Inspector General of Police for threatening to arrest prophets if they give new year prophecies that are not palatable. Primate Ayodele described the threat as fighting with God, adding that the IGP had created doom for the present government. In a statement signed by his media aide, Osho Oluwatosin, Primate Ayodele revealed that the devil is using the police boss, and that if care was not taken, he will destroy the government. He then urged the prophets in Ghana not to be afraid, assuring them that nothing will happen if they release prophecies. ‘’The IGP of Ghana has created doom for the government for saying prophets will be arrested over new year prophecies. The prophets should say whatever they want to say, nothing is going to happen. It’s obvious the IGP is being used by the devil and if care isn’t taken, he will destroy the government,” he said. On 2024 presidential election, Primate Ayodele revealed that the opposition party should allow John Mahama get the ticket because he has a good chance at winning. The prophet noted that God has turned his back at the present government and that John Mahama can win the next presidential election if he listens to instructions and work with the right people ‘’On the 2024 presidential election, John Mahama should return to the polls, he has a clear way now but he should listen to instructions and work with the right people. ‘’Opposition party will win the election in 2024, John Mahama should return to the polls. His party should also give him the ticket because God has turned against this present government,’’ he said.
