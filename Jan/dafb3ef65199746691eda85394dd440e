The Nigerian Government has disclosed that Nnamdi Kanu denied being a member of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB. Shuaibu Labaran, counsel to the Federal Government, said Kanu “vehemently” denied being a member of the proscribed pro-Biafra group. He disclosed this while speaking with journalists after yesterday’s court proceedings at the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja. According to Labaran: “One of the charges suggested that the defendant, Nnamdi Kanu is a member of IPOB and he vehemently denied being a member of IPOB. “That is very curious and we urge Nigerians to see us through how we are going to prove all those charges against the defendant in no time to come.” The Federal Government had on Wednesday, re-arraigned the Biafra agitator on a 15-count charge of treasonable felony. Kanu, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges when read to him. Binta Nyako, the judge, fixed February 16 to hear an application by the defendant challenging the propriety of his trial as well as competence of the charge against him. Kanu is locked up in the custody of the Department of State Services, DSS, following his re-arrest and repatriation from Kenya in June 2021. He was apprehended for agitating for Biafra and by extension Nigeria’s breakup.
