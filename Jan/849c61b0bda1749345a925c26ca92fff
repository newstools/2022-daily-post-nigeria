Former Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper, Paul Robinson has told Manchester United to get two players, Phil Jones and Donny Van de Beek, out of Old Trafford as soon as possible. Robinson said this ahead of Man United’s FA Cup 4th round tie with Middleborough on February 4. Man United has already sent Anthony Martial out on loan to Sevilla for the remainder of the season. But Robinson believes Jones and Van de Beek should leave Man United. Robinson told Football Insider: “Rangnick is not going to be there long term, so it is difficult. Will Manchester United move on players who the next manager might want?” “It has not worked for Donny van de Beek, regardless of how you look at it. Phil Jones has been there for a long time and I can’t see him playing regularly for Manchester United now. They are the two I would expect to go.” He added, “United needs to get these players out of the club and rejuvenate that playing squad. But to do that, they need a permanent manager at the helm. An interim manager isn’t the answer. I cannot fathom the thinking behind it.” Van de Beek has played 14 times for the Red Devils this season, while Jones has played just once for Ralf Rangnick’s side.
