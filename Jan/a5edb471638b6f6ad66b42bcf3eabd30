Awaji-Inombek Abiante, a member of the House of Representatives has alleged that new clauses have been inputted into the electoral bill to ensure President Muhammadu Buhari rejects it. Mr Abiante made the allegation on Wednesday during the consideration of the bill. It would be recalled that following the rejection of the amended electoral bill by President Buhari, the lawmakers had resolved to yield to the demands of the president on the direct primaries section of it. There have been calls for lawmakers to override the president on the bill. But the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila on Tuesday said the House will consider reviewing the clause to save the bill. Following the reconsideration of the amended bill by the lawmaker, Abiante raised a point of order that new items have been included in the bill. He stated that the fresh sections were inputted to give president Buhari an excuse not to sign the bill. “It is my suspicion Mr Chairman that it is intended for this electoral act not to be signed. These are all obstacles that have been put in the ways of Nigerians to actually determine who governs them so that they can provide effective leadership. Mr Chairman, we have to take all these clauses one after the other. And allow members to make input,” he said. Responding to the allegation, the Speaker said nothing was included in the bill. “The bill sent to the president ab initio is the same bill as it is, the only change is 84(2) where we have included indirect primaries,” the Speaker said. The bill was still passed despite the allegation by Abiante.
