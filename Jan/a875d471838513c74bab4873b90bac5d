Approving the reopening of the markets, the state Gov Hon. Bello Mohammed Matawalle said, “the decision to reopen the markets was informed by the series of reports received from the communities on some sanity in security, as well as the agreement reached between the government and the markets leaders in ensuring no criminal activity takes place in the markets and lives and property of individuals in the markets are safeguarded. “The government expresses its profound gratitude to the people in the state for the support and cooperation, as well as prayers they have been offering to the government and the security agencies who have been working tirelessly to safe lives and property of the people.” The commissioner said the recent onslaught on bandits in various parts of the state, particularly the vulnerable communities, has been yielding positive results as well expressed deep appreciation to the security agencies in the state for the ongoing operations in neutralising the bandits and flushing them out of the state. “Government will continue to work hand in hand with the security agencies and provide them with all the necessary support and assistance to make their job easier in the state,” he said.
