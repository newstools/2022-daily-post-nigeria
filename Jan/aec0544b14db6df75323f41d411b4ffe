A Rivers State High Court in Port Harcourt has ordered the arrest of two Italian nationals, Giandomenico Zingali and Davide Anelli, over their refusal to attend court to answer criminal charges against them in an alleged $119 million dollars power plant fraud. The court ordered the Inspector General of Police, Commissioner of Police and other security operatives to effect their arrest wherever they are and can be found. Justice Okogbule Gbasam invoked section 120 of Rivers State Administration of Criminal Justice ACJA to order the arrest and directed the IGP, CP and other security agents to produce the Italians in court to face trial in respect of the 16-count criminal charge filed against them by the Rivers State government. A certified true copy of the order of arrest was obtained on Friday in Abuja by DAILY POST correspondent through Chief Godwin Obla SAN who stood for Rivers State in the matter and moved the motion for the issuance of the bench warrant.
