Ex-England winger, Trevor Sinclair, has claimed Cristiano Ronaldo chose Manchester United over Manchester City last summer, because he felt he could bully then-manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Ronaldo was linked with a move to the Etihad as he pondered leaving Juventus, with Pep Guardiola in need of a new centre forward in his squad. However, the 36-year-old ended up sealing a stunning return to Old Trafford and City failed to land Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspur. Sinclair has now claimed Ronaldo did not want “to be second fiddle to Pep”. He told talkSPORT: “For me, one of the reasons I think he may not have considered Manchester City, and it’s certainly not winning trophies because he would have won a lot of silverware there. “I think it’s because he didn’t want to be second fiddle to Pep. Whereas he could go into Manchester United, he could almost feel like he could bully Ole. “And I think he just want to do what he wants for him and it’s not the best for the club.”
