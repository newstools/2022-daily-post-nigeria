Nigerian forward, Kelechi Iheanacho, has said that the Super Eagles will pick up ‘the pieces and convert their chances’ in their next 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, tie. Nigeria will take on Sudan in their next 2021 AFCON fixture on Saturday at the Roumdé Adjia Stadium, Garoua. Augustine Eguavoen’s side head to the game after beating Egypt 1-0 in their first game on Tuesday evening. Recall that Iheanacho scored the only goal of the match as Nigeria defeated Egypt. Speaking to reporters in the mixed zone after the game against Egypt, the Leicester City star said: “I feel great, I am really buzzing about getting the goal for my team. “We missed some goals in the second half [against Egypt], but hopefully next game we pick up the pieces and convert our chances. “Our team is always a confident team, we have a very intelligent group of players, we are really vibrant and strong. “We have been together for a while and we work together as a team.” The Super Eagles are in Group D alongside Egypt, Sudan and Guinea-Bissau.
