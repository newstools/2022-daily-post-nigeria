Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State has sworn in four new legal practitioners recommended for appointment as judges by the National Judicial Council into the state High Court. They are justices Olalekan Olatawura, Johnson Apuabi, Blessing Ajileye and Oyinkansola Oluboyede. Speaking during the programme, Governor Fayemi said implementation of the Judicial Financial Management Law would commence this month in the state. Governor Fayemi said the financial management law was geared towards improving the welfares of judicial workers. He also said he had directed the immediate payment of one month out of the arrears owed judicial workers in the state by the past administration. Fayemi, who charged the new judges to exhibit professionalism by sustaining the ethics of the bench, assured them that government would not shirk from its responsibilities to improve on the administration of justice in the state. He expressed happiness at the recommendations of four judges by the National Judicial Council, NJC, which he said was in response to agitations to review the process and procedures of appointing young lawyers to the bench. Responding, one of the newly sworn-in judges, Apuabi thanked the governor for the opportunity to serve with the assurance that they would not betray their trust.
