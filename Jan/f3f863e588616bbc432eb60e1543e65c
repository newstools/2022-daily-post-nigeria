Speaker of the Oyo State House of Assembly, Adebo Ogundoyin, has said that Mr Timothy Adegoke, an indigene of Eruwa in Ibarapa East Local Government Area of the state, must not die in vain. Ogundoyin, who is also an indigene of Eruwa, made this disclosure on Saturday. He spoke during the burial service of the 37-year old chartered accountant held in Eruwa. DAILY POST recalls that Adegoke was until his death, a Masters in Business Administration (MBA) student at the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, Osun State. The deceased was allegedly killed last year in a hotel he lodged in Ile-Ife. Adegoke, who was said to be a regular lodger in the hotel, left Abuja in order to write one of his examinations in the university the following day. The owner of the hotel, Mr Rahman Adedoyin, and some staff of the hotel have been arrested in connection with Adegoke’s death. The deceased’s body was released to the family on Friday after several weeks of investigation by security agencies. He was buried at Adegoke Lodge located at new Eruwa on Saturday. Ogundoyin, while speaking, said that the police and the judiciary must not allow the deceased to die in vain. He maintained that those investigating the case should ensure that everyone involved in his murder is not spared. “Today we are gathered to bid farewell to late Timothy Adegoke. Our eyes are heavy with tears as his remains are buried This was one death too many. “Our kinsman must not die in vain. I appreciate everyone who has joined in the campaign for justice for the late Timothy Adegoke. “I am sure his spirit too will join numerous Nigerians in ensuring that everyone involved in his gruesome murder is not spared. “They have lost their breadwinner hence we need to rise up in support of everyone the deceased left behind. May the Lord rest the soul of late Timothy Adegoke and grant him eternal rest in the bosom of the Lord”.
