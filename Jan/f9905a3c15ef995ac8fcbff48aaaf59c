Fire destroyed more than 250 shanties, 200 makeshift buildings and 40 sawmilling machines at Oko-Oba in Lagos on Wednesday. Ibrahim Farinloye, National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) South-West Coordinator confirmed the incident. The inferno, which started at about 11.40am, was later extinguished due to joint efforts of federal and state agencies. The Federal Fire Service, Lagos State Fire Service and the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) were at the scene. Those affected tried their best to save what they could before the fire intensified. Some have relocated to other places for temporary accommodation while many others are stranded. The poor citizens, mostly artisans and petty traders, are appealing for government assistance.
