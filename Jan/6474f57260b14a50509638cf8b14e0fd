President Muhammadu Buhari has said that he is not happy with the state of electricity in Nigeria because he identified that no country could develop without infrastructure means; road, rail and power. The President disclosed this during an interview on Channels Television on Wednesday. Asked if he is happy with the country’s capacity of electricity production, Buhari said, “I am not because I identify that no country can develop without infrastructure and infrastructure means road, rail and power. “This government is working very hard on the road. Try to imagine what was happening between Lagos to Ibadan six months ago and what it is now. “We are doing from Lagos to Kano by rail, road from here to Kaduna to Kano. So we have to get the infrastructure right and then Nigerians will mind their own business. But when the infrastructure is not there, the roads are not there, the rail is virtually killed, no power, what do we expect people to do?” Nigeria currently has the capacity to produce 13,000 megawatts of electricity, but presently, the country produces just 4,000 megawatts on the national grid. Buhari had in May 2018 queried the spending of $16bn on power projects during the administration of former President Olusegun Obasanjo.
