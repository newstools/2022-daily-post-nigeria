Nigerian Grammy-award winning singer, Burna Boy has invited Ghanaian artist, Shatta Wale to a one-on-one to settle any “personal problem”. Burna Boy took to his Instagram story to respond to Shatta Wale’s Twitter rant where he called out Nigerian artistes for not being supportive to Ghanaians. Shatta Wale had threatened to stop Ghanaians from supporting Nigerian artistes in one of his tweets as he boasted of selling out Accra stadium without them. “Bring it on Nigeria and your artist would not get that hype they get from Ghana. I can make that stop. “Your artist comes here for numbers before the world can recognize them. Appreciate Ghana supporting your artiste and stop this foolishness,” Shatta Wale wrote. Nigerian artistes not supporting Ghana valid, deserves critical attention – Stonebwoy Responding, Burna Boy warned that any agenda of separation in Africa be squashed, adding that America and South Africa music are also played in Ghana. The ‘Odogwu’ crooner wrote: “If Shatta or anyone has a personal problem with me, I am still open to fighting 1 on 1 and squash it after. “They play South Africa, American songs in Ghana but na Nigerian own be issue, Something is fishy.” Burna Boy reiterated that he remained committed to building a stronger Africa despite Shatta Wale and Stonebwoy’s statements. According to him, “Pushing this agenda of separation between our beautiful African nations is a grave disservice to the generations coming after us and it goes against everything I stand for as a man and as an unapologetic Pan-Africanist. “Nobody will ruin the unity we continuously try to build for a stronger and better Africa.” “I don’t use my father’s money for hype” – Singer, Shatta Wale shades Davido
