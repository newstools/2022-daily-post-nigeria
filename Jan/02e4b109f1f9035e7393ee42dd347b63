Former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Babachir Lawal has endorsed former Lagos Governor, Bola Tinubu, for President in 2023. He spoke on Monday in Abuja at a conference convened by the Support Groups Management Council (SGMC) for Tinubu. Lawal says the aspirant is qualified and will win, regardless of the mode of All Progressives Congress (APC) primaries. “Tinubu’s emergence as APC flag bearer should be a task for all party members”, NAN quoted him as saying. “We are not threatened by the mode of primaries. Being democrats, we prefer a method that involves all the card-carrying members. “Our task, from today, is to develop a smart strategic plan that will deliver Tinubu as APC candidate and thereafter the landslide winner of the 2023 presidential election.” Lawal described Tinubu as brilliant, tested, detribalised, and a proven excellent manager of financial and human capital. He informed citizens that the APC leader loves Nigeria and has a clear vision of where the country should be. Former Borno Governor, Kashim Shettima advised President Muhammadu Buhari and the APC to see Tinubu’s ambition as payback. The Senator recalled that it was Tinubu that ensured the emergence of Buhari as APC presidential candidate. “In 2015, some aspirants with a very huge war chest were itching to cling to the APC ticket and like the Rock of Gibraltar, Asiwaju and his progressive team stood solidly behind the candidacy of Buhari,” he said. Shettima reiterated his call that power should shift to the South in 2023 for equity and fairness. The lawmaker added that Tinubu should be given the choice of the first refusal because of his sacrifices for the party. On the controversy about Tinubu’s age and health, Shettima told critics that the presidency was not Olympic Games. “We are not here to prepare for the Olympics, but an institution that relies on the superiority of ideas to thrive,” he said.
