Celebrity manager Jada Pollock says it is degrading to be referred to as one of Wizkid’s baby mamas. Pollock made this known during a question and answer session with fans on Twitter on Friday, January 28, 2022, as she professed her love for Starboy. Pollock revealed she loves Wizkid with all her heart and has never loved anyone like him all her life. Her tweet read, “I love Wizkid with all my heart! I’ve never loved anyone like this in my lifetime. Our love is magical.” The mother of Wizkid’s third child, Zion, added that it is disappointing when people address her as ‘Wizkid’s baby mama’ without recognizing her achievements. “I think about this, so degrading and discriminating when I’m referred to as Wizkid’s third baby mother before addressing me professionally by my name. The credit of my Journey or experience is so underrated,” she wrote. When asked about her vision for Wizkid in 2023, Jada said: “For us to continue to inspire the world. There are no limits to what Ayo/Wiz can do! “He will consistently surprise us, so you never know what to expect. Whatever it is it will be GREAT.”
