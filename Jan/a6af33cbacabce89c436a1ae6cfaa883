Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has advised the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to take advantage of the ‘brewing crisis’ within the All Progressives Congress, APC, to take over power in 2023. Gov. Wike gave the advice on Monday when he paid a courtesy visit to his Bayelsa State counterpart, Sen. Duoye Diri at the Government House, Yenagoa. He stressed on the need for stakeholders in the PDP to remain united and formidable ahead of the 2023 general elections. The Rivers Governor reiterated that Nigerians were waiting for the PDP to rescue the country from the APC. He said, “I’ve come to let him know that PDP members must put themselves together to build the party. Without the party, nobody can be a presidential candidate. There must be a party. So, there is the need for everybody to work together, make the party united before we talk about who will be the presidential candidate. “We cannot afford to miss this opportunity that Nigerians are giving back to PDP to take over the government in 2023. Everybody must work together as a party. And as governors, we must work together. If we didn’t work together, we wouldn’t have had the best convention we have ever had as a party.” He also noted that the PDP may have difficult times in nominating a presidential candidate if the governors and the other members were not united.
