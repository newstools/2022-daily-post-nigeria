The Ondo State Police Command has said that it would prosecute one Olasunkami Oluwole for allegedly killing his lover in the Oke-Igbo community in the Ile-Oluji/Oke-Igbo Local Government Area. Biola Soyinka, the deceased, reportedly travelled from Lagos to see her boyfriend before she was murdered. Funmilayo Odunlami, the Police Public Relations Officer of the command, said the matter is being investigated at the command’s Criminal Investigation Department. According to the PPRO, the suspect would be charged to court immediately after the completion of the investigation. “The case is still at the state CID for further investigation, and after the investigation is completed, he will be charged in court,” Odunlami said. Meanwhile, the elder brother to the deceased, Akeem Jinadu, said Oluwole had on January 16 called them in Lagos that Biola had died after he claimed that she became unconscious when she slumped at around 4:00 am . “Oluwole said by the time he rushed her to the hospital, the doctors declared her dead. When we asked him to bring her corpse back to Lagos, he demanded that we send money for transportation. “Contrary to what Oluwole said when the police arrested him, there were marks sustained from beating on her body when we went to identify the remains at the morgue. “Her neck, face, and body had dark patches because she was a fair person,” Jinadu said. “From the state of her corpse it is very obvious she didn’t die from falling, rather the marks on her body shows she was beaten and strangled to death.”
