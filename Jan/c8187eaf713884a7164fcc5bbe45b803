Former Arsenal striker Kevin Campbell said that Chelsea boss, Thomas Tuchel has made a big mistake by deciding to drop Romelu Lukaku from the Chelsea squad at this point. He criticised the German, who Sunday decided to drop the Belgian from his squad to face Liverpool over the striker’s controversial interview aired last week. Tuchel was angered by the Belgium international’s interview where he criticised the club and the German boss. Lukaku had said he was unhappy with his current situation at Stamford Bridge, adding that he wanted to return to Inter Milan. “..I am not happy with the situation but I am professional – and I can’t give up now…” he said. Tuchel has left him out of the Blues matchday squad for Liverpool’s visit to Stamford Bridge. “I understand Thomas Tuchel has to show his power,” Campbell told Sky Sports News. “But if you are all of a sudden going to leave your star striker out, you are cutting your nose off to spite your face a little bit. “You need all your weapons. Look at Manchester City, they are 11 points clear. This is your next biggest rival who you have to beat at home and you are possibly leaving your star striker out. “It’s not right. You have got to play him.”
