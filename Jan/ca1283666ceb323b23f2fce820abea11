Former Governor of Imo State, Rt Hon Emeka Ihedioha has charged Imo people to remain steadfast and committed to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He assured that the party will take over the reins of power in Imo again after the 2023 elections. Ihedioha gave the assurance while speaking in his Mbutu Aronta village, in Aboh Mbaise LGA, Imo State while paying host to the PDP, Ngor Okpala LGA chapter. The former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives said that he has moved on with his life, focusing on the future after his 2019 Imo Governorship debacle. He said that what happened to him when he was removed through the court was a temporary setback. The former governor disclosed that his popularity and acceptance among Imo people had soared higher and that his electoral value had tremendously increased in the State. He asked PDP members to go home and register more members, stressing that a lot of people want to join the party, as the APC had disappointed the masses, both at the State and the national level. He reassured his followers that he will return to continue the good work he started for Imo people that was cut short due to the court judgement. “Be steadfast. Be patient. This suffering will not last forever. Soon, we will correct the problems and the masses will smile again,” Ihedioha said.
