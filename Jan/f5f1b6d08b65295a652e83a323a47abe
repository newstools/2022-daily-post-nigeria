The Pastor in charge of Spirit-Filled International Christian Church, Olomore, Abeokuta, Ogun State, Timothy Oluwatimilehin, has been arrested for allegedly having sexual relations with a woman and her two daughters. The pastor was alleged to have asked the woman to move out of her husband’s home to live with him. She reportedly moved into his apartment with her two daughters and a sexual relationship ensued between the four of them. The Ogun Police Command said the pastor was arrested following a complaint at Adatan police station by the husband of the victim and father of the children. The husband, who was reportedly accompanied to the police station by an official of the Ogun State Ministry of Women Affairs, had reported that the pastor lured his wife and his two daughters, “took them into his custody and have since been having sex with both the mother and her two daughters.” The Ogun Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed that the DPO of Adatan division, SP Abiodun Salau, had detailed his detectives to arrest the pastor. “On interrogation, the pastor confessed to the commission of the offence but pleaded for forgiveness. “In his confession, he explained that he took advantage of the little misunderstanding between the woman and her husband to carry out the devilish act,” Oyeyemi said in a statement on Thursday. Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, Lanre Bankole, has ordered that the case be taken over by the Anti-human Trafficking and Child Labour Unit of the State CIID for diligent investigation and with a view to charging the suspect to court.
