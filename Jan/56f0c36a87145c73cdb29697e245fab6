There was a fire outbreak Friday evening at the crates depot of the International Breweries PLC, Ilesa, Osun State. In a video obtained by DAILY POST, as the fire raged, motorists plying the route were advised by fire fighters to take alternative routes as this will enable them to extinguish the raging inferno. Due to the ferocity of the fire, the Federal and Osun State Fire Services, it was gathered, were forced to request extra help by calling for reinforcement from their stations outside Ilesa town. The call for help became inevitable as the fire, which cause could not be ascertained, was spreading out of control towards the power station situated beside the International Breweries. The combined efforts of fire service personnel after a while proved successful as the outbreak was put under control. The electricity power station is situated opposite Fadahunsi junction, Brewery Area, Ilesa.
