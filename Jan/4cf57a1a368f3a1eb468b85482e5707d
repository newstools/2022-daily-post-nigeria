Manchester United boss Ralf Rangnick has said his side’s 2-2 draw with Aston Villa in the Premier League on Saturday is the best game he has overseen since his appointment as the club’s boss. United looked all set to win the game 13 minutes remaining after two Bruno Fernandes goals. But Jacob Ramsey and Philippe Coutinho, who came off the bench with 20 minutes to go having joined on loan from Barcelona in midweek, created a famous comeback for the home side. United, without their legendary forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, who was out due to a hip injury, started with great intent with Fernandes giving them the lead after his tame strike from range somehow bobbled through the legs of goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez. However, United could not hold on to their lead as Ramsey got the Villa Park crowd rocking with a well-taken finish with 13 minutes left. Despite the poor result, Rangnick told Sky Sports after the game that it was actually his best since he arrived at Old Trafford in December. “I felt it was the best game since I came here, in the first half for 30 minutes we dominated the game. We took some steps forward but have a few things to do better. “The plan was to press them in the midzone and we did that very well in the first 30 minutes and controlled the ball, and those were the positives. When you are 2-0 up you have to defend better than we did in the last 15 minutes. “Right now is very disappointing, what we showed was a step forward but it is about getting the results, it feels like two points lost and given away.” Aston Villa will face Everton next Saturday while United has a rearranged Premier League clash with Brentford on Wednesday before hosting top-four rivals West Ham United on Saturday.
