Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said bandits have now been officially declared as terrorists, to enable security agencies take more stringent measures against them. Osinbajo made the declaration while at the Katsina Emir’s palace on a condolence visit over the passing of Dahiru Mangal’s mother, Hajiya Murja, recently. According to the Vice President, with all the new security measures in the country, “we should be able to see a very significant change in Nigeria’s security situation.” Osinbajo thanked the Katsina Emir and his chiefs for the warm welcome, while praying for continuous peace for his kingdom and the country in general. “This Kingdom will know prosperity under your reign. There will be prosperity, there will be happiness, joy and the country also will know peace,”
By the grace of God, peace would return to all our communities and villages in this state and all across the country which is according to the President’s desire,” Osinbajo prayed. The Katsina Emir, HRH Abdulmumini Kabir, in his remarks said, I am happy now that they have been officially declared terrorists. This is the way to go since dialoguing with them has failed.” At Mangal’s residence, VP Osinbajo eulogized the late Hajia Murja for her philanthropic gesture and extended help to the poor and vulnerable in the society. He said, “I was informed that since she died, there has been sadness everywhere and is because of the kind of person that she was. A woman who served her community throughout her life.” Osinbajo also prayed for God’s comfort and strength for the business mogul.
