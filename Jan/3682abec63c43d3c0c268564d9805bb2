Real Madrid boss, Carlo Ancelotti, has advised winger, Eden Hazard, on how he can get back to his best form. Hazard started just his ninth game of the season for Real Madrid in their 3-1 victory over Alcoyano in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday. Recall that Real Madrid signed Hazard from Chelsea in 2019. The 30-year-old has failed to make an impact since joining Real Madrid from Chelsea for £88.5 million three years ago. The Belgium international, who has been linked to a return to Chelsea, has been hampered by injuries throughout his time at Los Blancos. Addressing the media prior to Real Madrid’s LaLiga clash with Valencia on Saturday, Ancelotti said Hazard needs to have more trust in himself to return to his best level. “His physical condition is quite good, he just needs to trust himself, to have more trust [in his ability],” Ancelotti said. “I think he is really close to his best level and we hope we can see it again, see his best matches again.”
