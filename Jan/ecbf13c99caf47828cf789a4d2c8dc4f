Former CNN host, Piers Morgan, has told Arsenal to sack their manager, Mikel Arteta, if he doesn’t lead the club to a top-four finish this season. Morgan, a strong Arsenal fan, said this after Arsenal failed to beat Burnley in a Premier League tie at the weekend. Arsenal currently sits in the sixth position on the Premier League table with 36 points from 21 matches. “For all his tough guy talk and endless “trust the process” bull****, [Mikel] Arteta’s so far been a demonstrable failure at Arsenal,” Morgan told The Sun. “He’s been in charge for two years and 114 matches now and has a win record of just 53 percent, less than [Arsene] Wenger’s, whose last decade was woeful, and Unai Emery’s. “Yes, he won the FA Cup within months of taking over [thanks to two goals by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang]. But for a club like Arsenal, it is winning the Premier League and Champions League that matters and on which real success should be judged. “This season, despite Arteta splashing out £150million on new players, we are sixth and already out of both domestic cups. “If we don’t make the top four this season, and even that “achievement” seems such a lowly ambition for a supposed big club, then he should not be given a pay rise, he should be sacked.”
