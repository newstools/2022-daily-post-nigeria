Pastor David Ibiyeomie of Salvation Ministries has warned against speaking harshly about the founder of Living Faith Church, Bishop David Oyedepo. Ibiyeomie vowed to kill anyone who speaks harshly about Oyedepo. The clergyman explained that Oyedepo is his spiritual father, hence he would not allow anybody to speak harshly about him. He spoke on Wednesday at the Salvation Ministries Home of Success/Glory Reign Evening Session, Day 2, in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. Ibiyeomie said he has never prostrated before Oyedepo but he would not allow anyone to speak against him due to his love and loyalty. According to Ibiyeomie: “If I tell you this, you will be shocked. I have never prostrated before Oyedepo. “I am not from the west to lie down, but my heart loves him. I don’t need to lay down for him to know that I am loyal. “But my level of loyalty is too high. You talk about him harshly where I am, I will kill you. He may not talk, but me. You can’t insult my father. “Can they insult your biological father before you? Spiritual father is stronger than a biological father. “You say your father does not talk. If they accuse your father of being a thief, will you keep quiet?”
