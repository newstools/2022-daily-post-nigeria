Manchester United playmaker, Bruno Fernandes, has snubbed the latest contract offer from the club, according to The Athletic. Fernandes joined from Sporting in January 2020 and became United’s key man as the COVID-19 pandemic hit football. Last weekend, he scored twice against Aston Villa, taking his tally for the season up to seven for the season and 47 in total. However, with some of his teammates earning more money, the 27-year-old had been pushing for a raise on his £100,000 a week basic salary. Cristiano Ronaldo became the top earner when he returned to Old Trafford last summer and currently picks up four times as much as his compatriot. Fernandes has missed just two Premier League games since making his United debut, racking up 22 assists to go along with his 33 goals in the competition. The player and his representatives have now turned down a new contract offer before the turn of the year. Talks are not expected to resume until May, at which point United will know whether they have qualified for next season’s Champions League.
