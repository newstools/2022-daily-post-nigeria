Former Paris Saint-Germain star, Austin Jay-Jay Okocha, has reacted to Nigeria’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations 1-0 victory against Mohamed Salah led-Egypt on Tuesday. Nigeria defeated Egypt 1-0 in their Group D opening 2021 AFCON tie, thanks to Kelechi Iheanacho’s first-half goal. Speaking on Supersport, Okocha, a former Super Eagles captain, said Augustine Eguavoen’s men played well against Egypt, adding that the three times African champions have matured. “The team played well and I’m not surprised because they have been together for a long time. It shows that they have matured with the way they played against Egypt,” Okocha said. “The players are not new to themselves. They have been around for a while, only the coach is new after the sack of Gernot Rohr.” Nigeria’s next game is against Sudan on Saturday.
