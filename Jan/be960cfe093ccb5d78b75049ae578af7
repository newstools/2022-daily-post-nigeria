Super Eagles forward, Victor Osimhen has wished his teammates all the best of luck as they begin their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, Round of 16 tie against Tunisia on Sunday night. Osimhen is not in Cameroon, but the former Lille star is sending his support from Naples ahead of Nigeria’s AFCON last 16 against Tunisia at the Roumde Adija stadium. The Napoli attacker would have been in the lineup when Augustine Eguavoen’s side three-time tackle Tunisia, but he had to withdraw from the squad after failing to recover from a facial injury. His absence is a blow for Nigeria, but the 23-year-old has immense trust in his teammates and wished them good luck against Tunisia. In a tweet via his Twitter handle on Saturday night, Osimhen wrote on Twitter: “GoodLuck To The Super Eagles And SSC Napoli In Tomorrow’s Encounter Against Tunisia And Salernitana.” Osimhen is not the only big name missing from the Super Eagles squad at the 2021 AFCON. Nigeria is also without the likes of Emmanuel Dennis, Odion Ighalo and Leon Balogun.
