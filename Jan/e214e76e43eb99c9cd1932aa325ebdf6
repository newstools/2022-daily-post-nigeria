Pastor William Kumuyi, Founder of Deeper Christian Life Ministry, says the outcome of the 2023 elections will not be decided by prayers only. The General Superintendent charged citizens to get their voter’s card and participate in the process. Kumuyi gave the counsel on Wednesday in Ibadan while speaking on the church’s crusade to commence on Thursday. The religious leader urged Christians to pray to God to enthrone leaders that would make Nigeria better and also vote. “While we pray, we should take action to come out and vote. We need to understand that our destiny is in our hands”, NAN quoted him saying. Kumuyi noted that men of spiritual authority capable of influencing the condition of the country through prayers are needed. “Men who will stand in the gap for our nation, just like the few righteous in Sodom who Abraham asked God to consider when He wanted to destroy the nation,” he said. On visions about Nigeria, he said prophecies can be fulfilled at an appointed time, while some on conditions such as the case of Hezekiah in the Bible. “One can prophesy about a nation or continent, but one’s prayers and faith can always influence/affect the fulfilment of the prophecy”, the cleric added.
