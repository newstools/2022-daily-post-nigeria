A businessman, Saheed Rafiu on Friday prayed a Grade ‘A’ Customary Court sitting in Mapo in Ibadan, Oyo State, to dissolve his eight-year-old marriage to estranged wife, Mujidat, on grounds of ill-temper. NAN reports that Rafiu, who lives in Odo Ona Elewe area in Ibadan, made the appeal in his reply to his wife’s allegation of not showing her enough love. The respondent told the court that he became so irritated with Mujidat when she and her mother accused his own mother of masterminding the death of their first child. “My lord, after I became so frustrated by Mujidat’s disobedience and temper, I decided to issue her a divorce notice. “In fact, Mujidat started associating with a particular bad woman in our neighbourhood. I warned her on this, but she ignored my warnings. “Worst still, her mother always takes her side anytime I report her misbehaviours,” Rafiu said. He further said that his wife denied him access to their two children. Earlier, Mujidat in her petition to the court accused Rafiu of not showing her love. Mujidat, who sells electronics, said: “I live in constant fear of Rafiu’s divorce threats. “Although Rafiu does not beat me, he no longer loves me. I can feel it.” President of the Court, S.M. Akintayo ordered the petitioner to produce the children in court on the next adjourned date. She advised the couple to avoid any form of breach of peace. Akintayo adjourned the matter until March 19 for judgment.
