Popular singer and entrepreneur, Rihanna has confirmed she’s expecting her first child with her artist boyfriend A$AP Rocky. The couple confirmed this in photos obtained by E! News. Rihanna in the pictures can be seen showing off her growing baby bump as her boyfriend kisses her forehead. This pregnancy news comes two years after the old-time friends ignited romance rumours. Recall that in May, A$AP Rocky called Rihanna the love of his life in his interview with GQ. When asked what it felt like to be in a relationship, with the fashion Mogul, A$AP said, “It’s so much better when you got ‘the One.’ She amounts to probably, like, a million of the other ones. “I think when you know, you know. She’s the One.”
