Former Super Eagles captain, Austin Jay Jay Okocha, has blamed two players for the elimination of Nigeria from the ongoing 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, in Cameroon by Tunisia. Okocha said Super Eagles goalkeeper, Maduka Okoye and right-back, Ola Aina, should be held responsible for Tunisia’s match-winning goal against Augustine Eguavoen’s men. Recall that Tunisia had last Sunday sent the Super Eagles packing from the AFCON in the Round of 16, thanks to Youssef Msakni’s second-half goal. But Okocha believes Okoye should have saved Msakni’s long-range shot, while Aina would have fouled the Tunisia player before he took the shot. “You expect when things go the wrong way that the goalkeeper might save the day but I thought he went a bit early to his right side and then it was difficult for him to adjust and make that save,” Okocha told SuperSport. “It was a well taken shot there by the Tunisian and luckily for them that decided the game.” On Aina, Okocha added: “You buy a foul, do something, stop the momentum of the game and let your players recover, but he made it easier for them.”
