The power play within the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has claimed its first casualty, with the resignation of the Director-General of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), Dr. Salihu Lukman. Lukman’s resignation may not be unconnected with his tough stance against the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) chaired by the Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni. He had insisted that Buni and his committee members resign if they are unable to conduct the national convention of the party tentatively, February. The power play from the various interest groups and power blocks within the ruling party on whether the convention should hold in February or not eventually consumed Lukman, who was seen by many as the conscience of the party. DAILY POST can reliably report that the decision to relieve Lukman of his duty was deliberated at the meeting of APC governors held on Sunday at Kebbi Lodge in Abuja. It was, however, gathered that during the deliberation, the governors were sharply divided on whether to force Lukman to resign or not Investigations revealed that while the majority of the governors were opposed to Lukman’s resignation, few of the governors insisted that he must go. Efforts to get Lukman to react to the issue were unsuccessful as of the time of filing this report but sources at the PGF secretariat confirmed the development.
