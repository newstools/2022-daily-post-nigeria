Marc Wabara, a former Abia South Senatorial Candidate of the All Progressive Congress (APC) has tasked stakeholders of the party on unity. The APC chieftain regretted the internal issues that have negatively affected some members of the party and harped on the urgent need for stakeholders particularly in Ukwa East/Ukwa West Federal Constituency of the state to close ranks and unite to fight their collective cause. Wabara who spoke during the annual stakeholders meeting of the All Progressive Congress of Ukwa East/Ukwa West Federal Constituency, charged party leaders and members not to allow personal interests override their collective interests with a view to achieving what is rightly due to Ukwa extraction. His words, “We are also here today to discuss our concerns as key stakeholders of the party. “Our personal interests should not override our collective interest. We need to collectively forge ahead in this present political dispensation with a view to actualizing what is due to the Ukwa bloc. “Time has come for us to put away personal interests and let Ukwa agenda be paramount in our hearts”. On their parts, while delivering their respective speeches during the stakeholders’ parley, some prominent party leaders in Ukwa East, including Temple Nwachukwu and Goldie Wabara, decried the internal wranglings slightly being seen in the party fold in the state but expressed total confidence that the national leadership of the governing party will properly harmonize all the interests in order to have a stronger, more united APC.
