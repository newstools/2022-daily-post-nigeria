Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State has shared his thoughts on what should be done to flush out bandits terrorizing people of the State. El-Rufai said security operatives should “carpet-bomb forests” where bandits are located. Speaking on Arise Tv on Monday, the Governor said the trees around the affected forest can be replanted later, after the area has been bombed. He, however, admitted that carpet-bombing the forests would lead to collateral damage. El-Rufai noted that such measure would boost Agriculture in the rural communities. The Governor said lack of manpower was responsible for the prolonged inability of security operatives to curb banditry in the northwest. According to El-Rufai: “These bandits operate in the periphery because their hiding place is in the forest. It’s a major problem. The security agencies are doing their best but they are overstretched. “The reality is we don’t have enough boots on ground to address the myriad of security challenges that we face, and these security challenges are asymmetric, widespread, and there’s no part of Nigeria that doesn’t have one security problem or the other. “Ramp up the number of boots and more technology and more investment in armament and wipe these guys once and for all. “I’ve always believed that, you know, we should carpet-bomb the forests; we can replant the trees after. Let’s carpet-bomb the forests and bomb all of them.”
