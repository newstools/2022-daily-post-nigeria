Popular media personality, Bolanle Olukanle has weighed in on the controversy surrounding Gospel singer, Sammie Okposo. Okposo on Tuesday took to his Instagram page to confess he cheated on his wife. He also apologised to his wife and sought forgiveness from God. He also announced he will be taking a break from his ministry. His apology came after an American lady had alleged that Sammie Okposo impregnated her after they had an affair and told her to abort the pregnancy. Reacting to Okposo’s apology, Bolanle said although Sammie did a terrible thing by cheating, his decision to step away from ministry is the best way to restore himself. She said other pastors guilty of cheating should do the same by confessing and finding the foundation of their relationship with God before they lead others. On her Twitter page, she wrote, “This is how you restore when you have fallen as a minister, you must confess and also step away from ministry. “Honestly I’ll never understand why people ministers and pastors feel like they can cheat and go on like all is well. It’s not well! Cheating is a violation that is so deep and a reflection of a deep disconnect with where you should be, spiritually. “Yes, he did a horrible thing and now has made steps to restore and heal. You cannot be cheating and still ministering. Even if you have repented, leave the ministry, go and ask yourself why you were cheating. Find the foundation of your relationship with God before your lead others. “When you cheat and you are in a moral position you must step away from Ministry! You have to! And also it’s so important to hold yourself accountable and confess. When something is in the dark let it come to the light so that there is healing!
