The Senator representing Ondo South Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Nicholas Tofowomo, has vowed to quit politics instead of decamping to the All Progressives Congress, APC. Tofowomo, a serving senator on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, who described APC as a dead party, said the ruling party will be unsellable to Nigerians in 2023. The senator stated this during the weekend at an event he organised for youths in the southern senatorial district of the state where they were trained on ICT. “Rather than join APC, I’ll leave politics because APC is a dead party in Nigeria. They have wrecked the economy of this country. So, it is over my dead body, I can never decamp. For me, it’s PDP in the morning, afternoon and at night. And if I leave PDP, I’m going back home. “If you look at APC, it has ruined Nigeria’s economy, they have scored zero in that aspect. When they took power, a bag of rice was N6,000, now it is about N35,000. “APC is a party that is not sellable, everybody knows that APC has failed the nation. Armed robbery and banditry are now an integral part of Nigeria. Nobody is safe, it is as bad as that. So, APC has failed the nation. APC doesn’t have any agenda.”
