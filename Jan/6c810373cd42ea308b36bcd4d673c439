The Warri South Council Chairman, Dr. Michael Tidi on Thursday vowed to flush out miscreants under the guise of cultists who terrorise residents in the area. The Council boss made the vow in a statement in response to online reports that cultism has taken over some areas in the zone. He assured residents including motor spare part dealers in Lower Erejuwa of adequate security. While noting that the report came to him as a shock, Dr. Tidi said throughout the festive period there was no security breach in the Council area. Dr. Tidi, however, said the Warri South Council is ready to assist law enforcers in ridding the area of cultists. He used the opportunity to call on parents in the Council to warn their children to desist from joining cult activities for their own sake. He warned that anyone caught involved in any form of cult activity in the Council will be made to face the full weight of the law.
