Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola, has claimed Arsenal will be without ‘their most important player’ when both side in the Premier League on Saturday. Mikel Arteta will not be on the touchline against Manchester City as he is self-isolating after testing positive for Covid-19. He will watch the match from his London home, with former Manchester United coach Albert Stuivenberg set to fill in for him on the touchline. Arteta was Guardiola’s assistant for three years at the Etihad before being appointed to take his first steps into management with Arsenal in December 2019. Arsenal will also be without former captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang against City but Guardiola feels Arteta’s absence is the most significant. “I would say Mikel is the most important player they have,” said Guardiola ahead of the Saturday game. “I know his charisma and ideas and especially, his personality to do what he believes is the best for the team and the club. “The most important thing is for him to stay well, hope that the symptoms are low, everything is under control and he recovers and comes back to the place he loves, on the touchline and the sessions. “But since I arrived here, it is the best Arsenal I have ever seen in six seasons. It will be a challenge for us but we have an incredible opportunity to maintain the distance and continue our run.” Arsenal has been in fine form recently and would sustain their place in fourth position with a win over Manchester City. However, many pundits believe it would be difficult to young Mikel Arteta’s side to beat the Premier League leaders.
