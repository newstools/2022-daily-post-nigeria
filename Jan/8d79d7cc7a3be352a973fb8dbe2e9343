Actor Majid Michel has revealed that he experimented with drugs and engaged in street fights during his acting career. The Ghanaian actor, who recently became an evangelist, made this known in an interview on Joy FM. Majid revealed that he consumed narcotics until he became born-again. “I used to go out to drink, go and booze, we go and smoke, get into fights on the streets. So, I did some drugs; we tried something to see how it goes. “We get into fights at Members next to Glenz at Osu,” he said. The evangelist advised youths to be careful of people they associated with as they could influence them negatively. He, however, stated that although he knows God now, he never enjoyed going to Church. “Friends are critical. Be careful in choosing them because those you associate with play a role in how your life turns out. “Any young guy listening to me out there be careful who you associate with as it has a serious consequence on your future. “I have never enjoyed going to church. I don’t go to church because I despise getting out of bed in the morning,” the actor said.
