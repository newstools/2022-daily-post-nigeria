The Anambra State Governor-Elect, Chukwuma Soludo, has lamented the influx of drug barons and internet fraudsters known as Yahoo boys into politics. Soludo said the criminals are rushing into politics to avoid being arrested by security operatives. He spoke on Saturday at the first graduation of the School of Politics, Policy, and Governance Pioneer in Abuja. Soludo said Nigerians now see politics as a big business rather than a call to service. Soludo said oil money has “destroyed the social fabric” and some political stakeholders created political structures to make so many gains. “As the noose tightened globally on other rentier/criminal enterprises such as drug trafficking or internet scamming, many of the barons flocked into politics as the next easy alternative. “Politics has become big business. Appointment or election into public office is seen largely as an opportunity to ‘eat’ rather than a call to selfless service,” Soludo said. “There is an army of rich (big men) who have never worked or done any productive work in their lives and believe that it is their right to expect something for nothing.”
