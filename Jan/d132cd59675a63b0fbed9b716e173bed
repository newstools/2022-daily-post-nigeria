The Governor of Cross River, Ben Ayade has said he will run for president in 2023 if the All Progressives Congress (APC) considers him. Ayade stated this while speaking on Sunrise Daily, a Channels TV programme on Wednesday. While responding to a question on if he will contest for the presidency in 2023 on the platform of the APC, the Governor said the party should make the decision based on zoning. “I think the party should take a decision based on zoning principles which would be resolved as a party. “Let me say, yes and no. If the family (APC) finds that I am fit and proper, yes. If the family finds that there is a better option and that option fits into the zoning (arrangement), of course, I will stand by the party’s position. “I am a conformist; I stand with the system. I have never been an aberrant. I work with the system,” Ayade said.
