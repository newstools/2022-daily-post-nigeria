Nigerian winger, Moses Simon has promised the Super Eagles fans that the team will come back stronger following their shock exit from the ongoing 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, in Cameroon. Nigeria was eliminated from the AFCON round of 16 on Sunday night after losing 1-0 against Tunisia. Youssef Msakni scored the only goal of the match as Tunisia qualified for the AFCON quarter-finals ahead of the Super Eagles. Reacting, Simon, in a tweet via his Twitter handle on Monday, wrote: “Last night defeat hurts badly. “We had the support of our passionate fans and stepped on the pitch to defend our nation with all our hearts. Sadly, it did not end the way we wanted. “As a team, we win together, lose together and will come back stronger again; thanks for Ur support.”
