The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu has withdrawn his misleading comment on Permanent Voter’s Cards (PVCs). DAILY POST recalls that the former Lagos State governor, had on Tuesday, told some of his supporters in Abuja to register ahead of the 2023 presidential election because their PVCs had expired. While hosting the supporters in the nation’s capital, the APC stalwart urged them to “take one family member, two family members, knock on all doors and make sure that the new registration… Because they may not announce to you on time. The PVCs you have has expired. Yes!” The comment, however, did not go down well as Nigerians stormed the social media to lambast the presidential aspirant for misleading the general public. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) also swiftly countered the claim, warning Nigerians against heeding to his advice. Subsequently, Tinubu media outfit, in a statement apologized to Nigerians over the comment, saying it was a mistake. The statement reads in part, “On Tuesday night in Abuja, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu granted audience to a delegation of women from Lagos and across the country attending the All Progressives Congress Women Conference. “While charging the women to check the status of their voting cards and mobilise supporters to vote, he mistakenly used the word ‘expire’ instead of stating that the cards may have to be updated. “Immediately upon being apprised of this, Asiwaju apologised for the incorrect statement and felt sorry for any confusion it may have caused. “Asiwaju Tinubu also stressed that he appreciates the patriotic and necessary work of INEC and its personnel in assuring a free and fair electoral process for all Nigerians in all political parties”.
