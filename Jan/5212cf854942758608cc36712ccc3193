The Zamfara State Police Command has said its operatives have neutralized two bandits while trying to block the Funtua-Gusau road in Tsafe Local Government Area on Tuesday evening. According to the state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Mohammed Shehu, the bandits stormed the highway on seven brand new boxer motorcycles, with the intention to abduct innocent travellers and road users. “Brand new boxer motorcycle, live ammunition and mobile phones were recovered from the bandits,” he said. SP Shehu explained that the bandits had three days ago blocked the Funtua-Gusau road and kidnapped an unspecified number of persons among which the police rescued 29 victims, including pregnant women and nursing mothers. He however appealed to members of the general public to always endeavour to give credible information to the security agencies so that they flush the bandits out of the state.
