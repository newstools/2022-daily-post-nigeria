Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick has revealed his conversation with Cristiano Ronaldo as his team eliminated Aston Villa from the FA Cup third-round tie on Monday. Rangnick also provided the latest update on Jadon Sancho and Phil Jones. Recall that Ronaldo, Sancho and Jones missed Man United’s FA Cup 1-0 victory over Aston Villa at Old Trafford. “I would not say they are injured, but they have muscular problems,” Rangnick told MUTV of Jones, Sancho and Ronaldo. “I spoke to Cristiano [Ronaldo] yesterday before training and he said he’d had some problems for the last couple of days, spine minor problems and in the end, we decided it would make more sense not to take any risks in a cup game that could last 120 minutes. “With Phil Jones, he is having some minor problems with his calf, in a cup game tonight it does not make any sense. “With Jadon, he was supposed to be in the squad, he had some issues with hamstring on both sides, so it does not make sense to take any risks.”
