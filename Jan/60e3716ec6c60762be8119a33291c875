Super Eagles interim coach, Austin Eguavoen, has said he will remain the boss and new permanent handler of the team, Jose Peseiro. Peseiro will take over from Eguavoen after the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. The Portuguese was appointed as Gernot Rohr’s successor just before the tournament kicked off. Although Eguavoen will be in charge of the Nigerian team, Peseiro is expected to watch as an observer. Eguavoen has now made it clear he will remain his boss during and after the AFCON. “I can say, I’m the boss of the new coach and we have been talking,” Eguavoen said at his press conference ahead of the game. “Collaboration is good. Anything we are doing here, it’s important we build a team for him to continue when he takes over and add his own style.”
