An elder statesman and former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, SGF, Chief Olu Falae has taken a swipe at the former Governor of Osun State, Chief Bisi Akande over the latter’s position in his autobiography ‘My Participation’ on the 2014 CONFAB attended by some Yoruba elders. According to Falae, who was one of the delegates to the CONFAB, Akande misrepresented facts in the book which was launched in December 2021. Akande had, in the autobiography launched in Lagos, questioned some Yoruba leaders including Falae for attending the CONFAB. While describing Akande as a reckless individual who wrote “nonsense”, Falae who was also a former Minister of Finance said that delegates who attended the CONFAB were of different age grades including youths. Falae, who spoke in an interview at his country home in Ondo State on Friday, added that his passion for a new and better Nigeria was the basis why he attended the national conference as against the insinuation by Akande that he and others attended the CONFAB due to mouth-watering allowances doled out by former President Goodluck Jonathan. “I have decided not to say a word about the nonsense which Akande wrote. But I just know Akande is a very reckless person,” he said. “He’ll just say anything without thought, without thinking about the consequences, he will just say it like an irresponsible person. That is how he speaks.”
