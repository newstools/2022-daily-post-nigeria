President Muhammadu Buhari has said that the 2022 budget won’t fail but will accomplish the purpose for which it was passed because the National Assembly is led by trusted members of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Buhari, who said this while speaking on Channels Television on Wednesday, expressed confidence that this year’s budget will succeed. Recall that following the President’s assent to the 2022 budget, there were reports of friction between the presidency and the parliament. Buhari had expressed strong reservations on the “worrisome changes” made by the National Assembly to the 2022 Executive Budget proposal. When asked if he is afraid that the budget might not be able to achieve its purpose, Buhari replied, “No! Not at all. “My confidence that we can successfully implement the budget is because, in both houses, the party is leading. “It’s APC party and the leadership; look at the Senate President, he was in the House of Reps for two or three terms before he went to the Senate. “Look at Femi Gbajabiamila, I was watching on the television, when he was an ordinary member, he was always on his seat fighting for the party and the system we believe in. “Really, I consider myself lucky. My party and their competent leadership are both leading in the Senate and House of Representatives.” “That is why you don’t hear much about me, I allow them to do all the things because I can’t go against my party and I can’t go against people I have absolute confidence in. I know they are doing their best,” Buhari added.
