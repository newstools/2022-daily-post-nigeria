Goods worth millions of naira were on Thursday burnt in a fire that gutted the Mokwa Central Market in the headquarters of Mokwa Local Government Area of Niger State. DAILY POST gathered that the goods majorly affected in the incident were foodstuffs while four traders said to have slept in their stores sustained various degrees of injuries. They are said to be receiving medical attention at the Mokwa General Hospital. When contacted, the Paramount Ruler of the town, the Ndalile-Mokwa, Alhaji Mohammed Shaba, stated that the inferno destroyed more than half of the shops in the market. He revealed that the fire started at about 4 am and is still burning due to lack of adequate fire fighting equipment to put it out. “As I am talking to you now, the fire is burning. We have not been able to put it out, it started since 4 am. When they informed me of the fire outbreak, I quickly called the fire service, but due to lack of water tankers, they were not able to put it out. Now more than half of the market is destroyed,” he explained. Shaba also disclosed that about four hoodlums who took advantage of the situation to loot goods belonging to traders have been arrested. Lamenting the fire disaster, Mohammed Yabuku, a trader, said: “We have lost so much to this fire and it will be hard to recover from what is happening in this market today”. He stated that despite efforts to put out the inferno, it is still raging and destroying goods in the market.
