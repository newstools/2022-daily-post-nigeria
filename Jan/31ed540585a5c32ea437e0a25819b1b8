Military personnel from the Nigerian Army’s 32 Artillery Brigade have moved the over 150 persons arrested in Ekiti State suspected of being political thugs to the 32 Artillery Brigade, Akure, Ondo State. Soldiers stationed at Ita Awure/Efon Junction in Efon-Alaaye, Ekiti State, arrested the thugs around 3am on Wednesday. The thugs, who were armed with guns, cutlasses, charms, and other weapons, were taken to the 32 Artillery Brigade in Akure following their arrest. The suspects were said to have come to Ekiti in 18-seater passenger buses all the way from Ibadan, Oyo State down to Ekiti State ahead of the governorship primary of the People’s Democratic Party, PDP. Captain Akin Omojokun, the Brigade’s public relations officer, confirmed the arrest when contacted, but declined to provide further details.
