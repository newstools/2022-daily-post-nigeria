Former Chelsea star, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has slammed Romelu Lukaku for his ‘disrespectful’ against the club. The Belgium international has been dropped from the Chelsea squad to face Liverpool after he criticised the club and their manager, Thomas Tuchel in a recent interview Lukaku, in the interview, said he was unhappy at Stamford Bridge, adding that he wanted to return to Inter Milan. He said the Blues was only his fourth choice, putting Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich ahead of Chelsea for clubs he really wanted to join last summer. And Lukaku’s behaviour has angered Hasselbaink. He told Sky Sports, “I don’t understand that, I really don’t understand. “That is fine having frustration that you’re not playing. How you react to that is coming in at Aston Villa and making and showing the difference. “Every player is going to go through bad spells, every player is going to have injuries, and if you’ve not come back the way that you should the manager has got the right to not play you. “It’s four matches, to spit your dummy out after four matches and you want to go back to Inter because they have sorted you out when you came from Man Utd. “If you really wanted to stay at Inter then say I’m not going to Chelsea, give me half my wages and I’ll stay. “Of course, we all know he had to leave Inter because they were in financial trouble. If you really love Inter and love the club say I’m staying and give me half my wages, I want to stay here. “That doesn’t happen but you’re here now and what he has done is really disrespectful.”
