Popular singer, Simi has chastised upcoming artistes for being unserious about their careers. Simi on Friday took to her Instagram stories advising those willing to grow to stop posting irrelevant stuff not related to music on their social media pages, adding that such is not a great tool. She warned them to leave such a trend of posting shoes and sunsets until they make it as an artiste. Her post read: “You’re a serious growing artist and you have only three posts on your page: a picture of sunset, one of aeroplane and one of your shoe. “Nothing with your music in it, that’s not a great tool. “If you want it badly always be selling yourself leave the mysterious shit for when you’ve won. Even then, still leave it.”
