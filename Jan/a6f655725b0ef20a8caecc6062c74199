Barcelona star, Sergino Dest, will not be leaving Camp Nou during the January transfer window, amid interest from Chelsea. This was disclosed by Michael Reschke, Head of European Football at ICM Stellar Sports, who represents Dest. Chelsea have been credited with a keen interest in Dest this January transfer window. Dest left Ajax to join Barcelona in 2020 but has struggled to become a regular starter. He has also struggled with injuries during his time at the Catalan club. While the club have managed to finally offload Philippe Coutinho to Aston Villa, Barcelona are desperate to lighten their squad further with January signing Ferran Torres still unable to be registered. Speaking on the development, Reschke categorically told BILD: “He has no intention of changing clubs.” Meanwhile, Chelsea were already seeking cover at left wing-back after losing Ben Chilwell to injury for the rest of the 2021/22 season.
