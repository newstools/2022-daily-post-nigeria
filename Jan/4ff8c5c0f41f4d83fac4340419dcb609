Arsenal striker, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, is close to joining Barcelona this January transfer window. According to Sky Sports, Barcelona are in advanced talks with Arsenal to sign Aubameyang on loan. Barcelona and Arsenal have not agreed to the deal yet, but there is increased confidence it can be completed before the January transfer window closes on Monday night. The LaLiga giants would not have an option to make Aubameyang’s switch permanent, and discussions continue over how much of the 32-year-old’s wages they would cover. The deal would see Aubameyang move to the Nou Camp until the end of the season. DAILY POST reports that Aubameyang was banished from Arsenal’s first-team by manager, Mikel Arteta, after a disciplinary breach led to him being stripped of the captain’s armband. The Gabon international last played for Arsenal on December 6, 2021.
