Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State has said he does not have the willpower to sack any of his aides, civil servants or personal staff who commits any offences. Ayade said he is always moved with emotion and fear of what will happen to them if he sacks them over poor attitude or refusal to carry out any assigned tasks or his orders. The governor addressed journalists in his office over the ongoing calls by APC stalwarts for the sack of workers in his government who are still loyal to opposition PDP. “I do not have the hearts to lay off my workers or government staff. Sometimes I will have reports about those that have committed very serious offences. “I have even personally caught some red-handed doing the very wrong things. “I will ponder over what they, especially their wives, children and dependants would go through if I sacked them. These thoughts would force me to overlook and forgive them”, he said. Ayade said the aides and civil servants said to be loyal to PDP are first citizens of Cross River State. The money used in paying them belongs to the state, not APC. “It is not morally very right to lay them off from their works simply because they are not in my party yet. “I play politics with moral conscience. As governor, I am also a father of the state. I can only be forced to sack when it has become too unbearable”, he said.
