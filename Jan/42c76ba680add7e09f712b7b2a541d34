A strange fire has razed down some sections of a popular grains market in Potiskum town, Yobe State. According to an eyewitness account, the fire gutted the market in the early hours of Friday at about 3am local time, before firefighters rushed to the scene where they succeeded in putting it off. One of the shop owners, who gave his name as Alhaji Abubuwa told newsmen that, “I woke up with a phone call that fire has razed down our shops. “I rushed and came here to see for myself the level of damage. As I am talking to you now, I have lost hundreds of bags of maize, beans, groundnut, animal feeds, among others”. Another victim, Alhaji Danlami said he also lost similar items to the fire, including milling and processing machines. They appealed to the government and good spirited individuals to come to their aid. “We lost unquantifiable items, we believe it is as a result of electrical fault”, they claimed. Recall that recently, similar incident had hit Nguru popular market in the State, where goods and other property worth millions of naira were destroyed.
