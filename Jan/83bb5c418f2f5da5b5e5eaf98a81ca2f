The Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) has cautioned governors against politicizing education. The North East Zone told them to stop establishing universities they cannot fund. The warning is part of a communique issued on Friday after a meeting in Maiduguri, the Borno capital. SSANU National Vice President, Abdulkadir Isa urged the government at all levels to invest massively in education. “The neglect and poor funding of universities by some governors to the detriment of teaching and research is a matter that requires urgent attention”, it read. The body condemned the formula used for sharing the N22.1billion released by the Federal Government for the Earned Allowances – 75 per cent for teaching staff and 25 per cent for non-teaching staff. SSANU lamented that non-teaching units in schools are being usurped by teaching staff in violation of condition of service and establishment procedures. On pending cases of earned allowances, the union reminded Federal and State Governments of the 2009 agreement. SSANU wants full implementation as well as the reflection in monthly salaries. “We are against the forceful retirement of our members at the age of 60 in violation of the 65 years agreement in state universities,” the communique added. The members, however, expressed concern over insecurity and inflation in the country. They further requested a law that will allow the inclusion of unions in university governing councils.
