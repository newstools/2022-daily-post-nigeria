Former presidential aide, Reno Omokri has reacted to the Super Eagles defeat of the Pharaohs of Egypt in the ongoing African Cup of Nations, AFCON. Omokri commended Super Eagles players for preventing Mohammed Salah from playing his game during the match. In a post on his Facebook page, Omokri applauded the performance of Iheanacho and Moses Simon. According to Omokri: “I like what our boys did to Salah. He was off his game because our boys were on top of theirs. To me, this is the best performance of #AFCON2021 so far. “Iheanacho was obviously the Man of the Match, though Moses was the life of the team. This is the first time Egypt lost the first round in an AFCON in a long time! The mood in Nigeria is good. “So good, that I fear lots of babies may be conceived today. We really needed this bit of good news after a week of calamity in other spheres of our national life!” The Super Eagles of Nigeria opened their AFCON campaign with a 1-0 win against Egypt.
