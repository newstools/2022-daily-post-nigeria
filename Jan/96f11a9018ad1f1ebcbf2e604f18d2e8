Chelsea captain, Cesar Azpilicueta has said that he did not understand why the referee failed to send off Liverpool’s Sadio Mane after the Senegalese’s elbow on him during their 2-2 draw on Sunday. The Spaniard insisted that it was a ‘clear red’ and slammed Premier League officials for their lack of consistency. Just six seconds into the match, Azpilicueta was floored and referee Anthony Taylor showed the Liverpool forward a yellow card. Azpilicueta told Sky Sports after the match that, “It’s a clear red, I don’t mind if it’s five seconds into the game and the first actions, it’s a clear red. “He doesn’t want to challenge, he doesn’t want to see the ball, he just wants to hit with the elbow. Honestly I don’t understand it. “The other day we had two penalties where VAR didn’t come, today the first action is a clear red card. “Of course we are getting these decisions against us that of course could change the way of the game. “I can understand we are promoting 50/50 challenges in the Premier League, but sometimes we have seen joke penalties and sometimes, we see real dangerous actions and we don’t take action. “We saw for a few weeks, for a few games where referees become a bit softer in terms of red cards. “Then it becomes the opposite – I don’t know what happens. We don’t have consistency even in the same game or through the season. It is disappointing.”
