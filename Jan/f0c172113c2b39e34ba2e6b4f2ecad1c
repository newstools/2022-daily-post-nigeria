Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State has described the late former Gov. of Oyo State, Otunba Christopher Alao-Akala as a shock. Fayemi, in a statement on Wednesday in Ado-Ekiti signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, said Alao-Akala, who was a man of the people, showed no sign of illness the last time he saw him. He stressed that the former governor was in his usual high spirit during their last meeting and did not bear any sign of illness. The Chairman of Nigeria Governors’ Forum described the deceased as an apostle of politics without bitterness and a leader whose interaction, influence and network cut across political divides. He added that the deceased played a prominent role in ensuring that peace returned to the Oyo State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Fayemi noted that the demise of the late politician amounted to a double blow for the people of Ogbomosho, his home town, who were still mourning their late monarch, Oba Oladunni Oyewumi, who passed away barely one month ago. “Otunba Alao-Akala’s death came as a shock. We shall miss his amiable personality, wittiness and dynamism,” the statement said. The Governor offered his condolences to the government and people of Oyo State, members of Alao-Akala family and his political associates.
