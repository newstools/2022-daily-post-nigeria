There is tension in the Omuanwa community in Ikwerre Local Government Area of Rivers State following the killing of a Nigerian Air Force officer who had been in the community to celebrate Christmas by members of a local vigilante group. The deceased, who hailed from the community, was shot after he had accosted the vigilante members for allegedly harassing his brother. A source who narrated the incident said the members of the local vigilante had “gone on rampage chasing and forcing some youths in the community to take an oath”. In the process, the deceased’s brother was apprehended and locked up in the cell of the local vigilante, an action that led the late officer to approach the vigilante members. The source said he was shot with a pump-action gun before he died on the way to a hospital. The vigilante members are said to have since fled the area after youths went on rampage. All efforts to reach out to the leadership of the vigilante proved abortive as their lines were switched off. In the meantime, the Rivers State Police Command said it has not been briefed about the incident. The Public Relations Officer of the command, Grace Iringe-Koko, promised to issue a statement as soon as she is briefed about the incident.
