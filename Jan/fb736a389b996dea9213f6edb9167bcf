The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Wednesday, disclosed what to expect in the days ahead in 2022. IPOB said Nigerian security operatives will have no peace of mind until its leader, Nnamdi Kanu is released. Emma Powerful, the spokesman of IPOB, said God would torment security agents until they release Kanu unconditionally. In a statement signed by Powerful, IPOB declared that the struggle for the actualization of Biafra would be successful. According to Powerful: “We are the global movement and family of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) ably led by our prophet and indefatigable liberator Mazi Nnamdi Okwuchukwu KANU. We wish to commend Biafrans, friends of Biafra and lovers of Biafra freedom for their resilience and efforts towards the actualisation of Biafra independence. “We happily welcome all into 2022. We assure our people that the struggle will record more tremendous successes more than the previous years. “Our achievement in the struggle for Biafra restoration will marvel many traitors because IPOB will soon showcase our achievements so far. We have accomplished so much since this fight for our freedom started, and we give the credit to the Almighty God in heaven who has ordained the restoration of Biafra. “We want to declare that Nigeria Government and its security agencies will have no peace of mind unless they release our leader Mazi Nnamdi KANU unconditionally because our God will torment them. Kanu is on a divine project and nobody will hold him and have peace of mind. “The leadership of IPOB headed by Mazi Chika Edoziem has given an order for all IPOB family across the world to activate the protest to show our anger towards the illegal abduction and extraordinary rendition of our Leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu from Kenya to Nigeria. To this end, we want to inform all Biafrans to get ready to solidarise with our leader as usual, in his next court appearance scheduled for January 18, 19 and 20.”
