Anthony Martial is back in the Manchester United squad after discussions with interim boss, Ralf Rangnick. The France forward wants to leave in January, but has so far failed to secure an exit. Last weekend, Rangnick claimed the player didn’t want to be included for their Premier League game at Aston Villa, a statement Martial has since refuted. But Martial could again be involved against Brentford on Wednesday after discussions were held. Anthony Elanga was given against Villa and showed signs of promise. He will again be in contention with his presence keeping Jadon Sancho out of the starting XI. Sancho, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Luke Shaw were also among those not spotted at the airport, but are likely to have travelled, reports the MEN. Confirmed squad members: De Gea, Heaton, Henderson, Varane, Maguire, Lindelof, Telles, Jones, Matic, McTominay, Fred, Van de Beek, Fernandes, Mata, Elanga, Martial, Ronaldo.
