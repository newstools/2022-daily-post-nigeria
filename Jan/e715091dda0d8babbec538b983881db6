Aston Villa manager, Steven Gerrard has slammed the long delay before Danny Ings’ goal was disallowed against Manchester United on Monday night. According to him, it took the wind out of their sails. The match was held up for more than three-and-a-half minutes, after Video Assistant Referee (VAR) advised referee Michael Oliver to take a look at the pitch-side monitor. Oliver eventually ruled the goal out for Jacob Ramsey’s foul on Edinson Cavani. When asked about the decision, Gerrard said: “How long have you got? The officials took three-and-a-half minutes to settle that one. “The linesman said it was to do with Jacob impeding Cavani’s run. “It wasn’t that complex to need three-and-a-half minutes and it’s disappointing as we were in a good place at the time and that took a bit of sting out of the game.”
