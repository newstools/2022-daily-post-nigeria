Veteran striker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic has named Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper, Gianluigi Donnarumma as the best in the world. The Swede is surprised that the Italy No.1 goalkeeper is warming the bench at Paris Saint-Germain. Donnarumma was Ibrahimovic’s teammate at AC Milan before the Euro2020 winner left Italy on a free transfer to PSG last summer. However, manager Mauricio Pochettino has kept faith in former Real Madrid goalkeeper, Keylor Navas, making the Italian only a second choice. Donnarumma was the best goalkeeper in the European championship, during which he helped Italy lift the trophy “I am very surprised. I know it’s not easy for the coach, I don’t know Navas but he’s a great goalkeeper too,” Ibrahimovic told L’Equipe. “They have two phenomena in goal. In my world, Donnarumma is number one today. And I don’t know if it’s a good thing to alternate goalkeepers, or if it’s more of a favour you do to one of them. “In any case, I’m used to having a goalkeeper who is number one and is always the same. And about Donnarumma there is no question: he is the best in the world, and that’s that. I played with him, I know what I’m talking about.”
