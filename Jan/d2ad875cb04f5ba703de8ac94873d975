Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, on Sunday morning departed Abuja for Accra, Ghana, to represent President Muhammadu Buhari at an Extraordinary Summit of the ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State and Government to discuss the political situation in the Republic of Mali. Today’s meeting, which is expected to be attended by leaders across the region, follows previous meetings and efforts by the leaders to resolve the situations in Mali and Guinea. This was disclosed by Laolu Akande, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media & Publicity, Office of the Vice President, today. In 2021, Osinbajo participated in meetings of leaders across the sub-region on the issues exploring solutions. On September 8, the VP participated in a virtual summit of the regional body where sanctions were imposed on the military junta in Guinea, and on the 16th of the same month, attended another ECOWAS summit where further sanctions on individuals and groups fueling the crisis in Guinea and Mali were discussed. Later in November 2021, Osinbajo again joined other leaders in Accra for the 3rd Extraordinary Summit of leaders across the sub-region to review decisions and the political situations in Mali and Guinea. In compliance with the decisions of the leaders, ECOWAS mediator, former President Goodluck Jonathan, travelled on January 5, 2022, to Mali to meet with authorities in the country over the timetable for democratic transition. Indeed Dr. Jonathan briefed President Buhari on the matter recently. Osinbajo, who is being accompanied by the Minister of State Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Zubairu Dada, is expected back in Abuja today.
