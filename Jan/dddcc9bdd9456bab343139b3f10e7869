One of the Chairmanship aspirants of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Mustapha Saliu has said that consultations are still ongoing over the national convention of the party. He said the February date tentatively slated by the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the party is still a possibility. Mustapha stated this Tuesday in Abuja at the APC Stakeholders Summit, organised by the APC Rebirth Group with the theme; “Rebuilding the APC of our Dreams.” On the convention, he stated: “Like you all know and I am sure you are well informed about the meetings that are going on at the party. “Definitely the convention will hold but you must allow those who have been saddled with the responsibility to come up with the most appropriate time which I believe they hinted before that it will be in February, which I believe they are putting final and finishing touches to the mode and conduct and the date that will be chosen. “So, for me, it is still a work in progress and we must give them that necessary support and give them that benefit of the doubt to help us to have a very successful convention.” Mustapha said if, given the opportunity, he would ensure there is a reward system that can be very beneficial and can be very befitting to those who labour for it.
