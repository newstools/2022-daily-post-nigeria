Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand, has given reasons why Anthony Martial did not succeed at Old Trafford. According to Ferdinand, the French international was too inconsistent and predictable during his time with the Red Devils. The 26-year-old is all but set to leave Manchester United for Sevilla on Tuesday after starting just two Premier League matches this season. The Frenchman moved to Old Trafford from Monaco for £36 million in 2015 but never fully lived up to this enormous price tag or billing. And former England international, Ferdinand feels something still needs to ‘click’ in order for the forward to reach the top level. Ferdinand told his FIVE YouTube channel, “I just feel with Anthony Martial he didn’t move enough off the ball, he didn’t make runs in behind. But he’s quick! “Sometimes you’ve got to vary the way you attack opponents and you can’t always want the ball to feet. I just feel he probably didn’t hurt defenders in behind as much as he could have, and he didn’t threaten in behind like he should have. “You look at Sadio Mane, Marcus Rashford sometimes when he plays off that left-hand side, Raheem Sterling, they don’t only just come to feet because for a defender it becomes a lot easier to read. You have to vary the point of attack and I don’t think he did that enough. “You see things levied at him that he didn’t smile or he was moody etcetera, but I just feel if you look more at his football and the way he played his football: inconsistencies. When you’re going to build a winning team you can’t have people that are inconsistent in your team. “It’s about output and doing it on a consistent basis and I think there might be some sort of mentality shift that he needs, maturity maybe. “But something has got to click from within for him to go on now and really fulfill that potential that he has, because I think he’s a fabulous footballer on his day but there haven’t been enough of those days.”
