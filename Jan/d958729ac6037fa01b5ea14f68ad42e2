Former Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar (rtd.) has warned that the proposed fuel subsidy removal will cause further harm to Nigerians. Abdulsalami spoke on Thursday at the 19th Daily Trust Summit in Abuja, pointing out that the country is already facing challenges on multiple fronts. The Buhari administration has made public its plan to stop the payment of fuel subsidy by June 2022. However, many stakeholders, including the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, feel the move is insensitive and wrongly timed as the citizens are already going through untold hardship. “Unemployment or underemployment remain at record levels,” General Abdulsalami said, adding “and over 80 million Nigerians are still caught up in needless poverty. “All of these tend to have negative effects on security. “In fact, Nigeria now faces a food security crisis that is compounded by the COVID-19 global pandemic and the banditry in many States in Northern Nigeria. “All of these have disrupted the fragile value chains across the country, and negatively impacted the ability of Nigerians to produce, process and distribute food. “The result is a continued rise in the prices of food items, beyond the reach of many Nigerian families. “On top of all these, fuel prices are expected to rise significantly in the coming months as announced last November by the NNPC. “We all know when this happens, as the government has planned, it will push many millions deeper into poverty.”
