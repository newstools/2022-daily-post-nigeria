Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State on Thursday has said it is time for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to rescue Nigeria from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Makinde, made this disclosure when he received the Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, who was on a courtesy visit to the state. Wike was accompanied to Ibadan by a former Governor of Rivers State, Celestine Omehia; former Deputy Speakers of the House of Representatives, Chinudom Nwuche and Austin Opara as well as the former Presidential Adviser on Amnesty Office, Mr. Timi Alaibe. Makinde while receiving his guest, explained that the past seven years has been filled with many disasters in the country. He added that Nigeria went into recession two times within the period under review. He then called on Wike and other governors on the platform of PDP to rise and rescue the country from APC in 2023. Makinde said the unity of PDP should be paramount to members. He said Nigerians are waiting for PDP to take over from the APC in 2023. He added that the population is growing at an alarming rate, saying that the time to rescue Nigeria from the APC is now. “The unity, especially that of the governors of our party is paramount and most of the successes we have recorded so far are really because we are together. “This is a year we have to make serious decisions, because whatever we do and whatever the outcome is, Nigerians will have to live with that for the next four years. “The past seven years have been a real disaster. If you look at the data, an economy that was growing at the rate of 5 to 6 per cent yearly before then suddenly became poor. “We went into recession and we thought we were coming out but still went into another recession. “Meanwhile, the population is also growing at an alarming rate. So, just like our party has been pushing, this is the time to rescue Nigeria. We have a serious role to play in that effort”.
