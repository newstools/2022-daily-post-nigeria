Joseph Odok of the University of Calabar has flayed Governor Benedict Ayade of Cross River State, for declaring that the All Progressives Congress, APC, gubernatorial race will be zoned to the southern senatorial district of the state. In a statement released in Calabar, Odok said such pronouncement in favour of the south will hit the rocks, adding that the governor is standing alone in his pronouncement. According to the university don, Ayade made the pronouncement at his “whims and caprices” without consultation with any stakeholder in APC. “The party is surely more than Gov Ayade. I have spoken to some APC stakeholders in the central senatorial district wishing to run for the gubernatorial position. Let me keep quiet now but Gov Ayade’s attempts to impose zoning to the south will be fought by many in the coming days. “In a democracy, everyone has a right to vote and be voted for and the governor will not go far with his unilateral decisions without consultation with relevant stakeholders.” Odok mentioned that there are strong and good governorship materials from the central, including Chief Chris Agara and Distinguished Senator John Owan Enoh. It would be recalled that on more than two occasions, Gov Ayade had publicly declared that zoning will be maintained, and that it is time for the southern senatorial district to produce a governor. “My position is that governorship should come to the south. I stand by that”, he had maintained.
