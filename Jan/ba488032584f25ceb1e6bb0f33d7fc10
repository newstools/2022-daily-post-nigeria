The Governor of Ondo State, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, has granted state pardon to six condemned inmates on death row across the various Correctional Centres within the state. The lucky six inmates who were awaiting execution by hanging following their convictions by courts in the state, had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment by the governor. Four other inmates, who were serving various jails terms in the state were also beneficiaries of the governor’s gesture after they were set free from incarceration. The benevolence of the governor also smiled on another inmate who had his life imprisonment sentence commuted to 15 years. The Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Charles Titiloye, who is also the Chairman, Ondo State Committee on Prerogative of Mercy disclosed this in a statement he issued on Saturday. According to the Attorney General, the move by the governor was made to commemorate the 2022 New year celebration, adding that the inmates were released based on report of good conducts received from the authorities at the correctional centres. He said “The release of the inmates was in exercise of the power confered on Mr. Governor by paragraph (a) (c) and (d) of subsection (1) of section 212 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended).” While urging the released inmates to turn new leaves as well as to see it as another opportunity to live a good life as better and reformed citizen, the governor urged the members of the public to accommodate and reintegrate them and not to discriminate against them.
