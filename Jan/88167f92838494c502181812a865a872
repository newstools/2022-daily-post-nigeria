Governor Okezie Ikpeazu’s ex-Commissioner for Industry, Henry Ikechukwu Ikoh, has announced his intention to vie for the office of Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, to represent Abia central Senatorial District of Abia State in the coming 2023 general elections in Nigeria on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Ikoh, while adducing what propelled him to run for the position of Abia Central Senator, during an enlarged meeting with members of his campaign team (Our Destiny Organization) held at country home, Ahuwa Oboro in Ikwuano local government area of the state, during the weekend, said that he was moved to contest the seat because of his desire to offer quality service to the people of the Abia central senatorial zone. “I will ensure the rehabilitation of Umuahia-Ikwuano-Ikot Ekpene road, immediately I am sworn in as a Senator. My representation will be hinged on attracting development. My representation will turn things around and change the development narrative of not only Abia central, but the entire Abia state”. “I will never withdraw, nobody had given me money to step down for him in the past and this will not be an exception. I will fight to the end and ensure that victory is eventually secured. I’m in the race to win and offer the best service to my people”.
