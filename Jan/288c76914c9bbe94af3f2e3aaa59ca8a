The Force Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba, has said the Nigeria Police extended the online registration in the ongoing 2021 police constable recruitment to Saturday, January 22, 2022, to allow Southerners apply. In a statement on Wednesday, Mba said the extension became necessary “to ensure equal opportunity and even spread of applications, particularly from states in the South-East, South-South geopolitical zones and Lagos State.” He said the extension would enable the southern states to meet up with the required quota for their respective states. Giving a breakdown of the applications received so far, Mba said out of the 81,005 applications received nationwide as of January 7, 2022, only 1,404 applications (less than 2% of the total applications) were received from the five states in the South East. MBA added that only 261 were from Lagos State, adding that Anambra has the least figure of just 158 applicants. Consequently, the Force appealed to states, local governments, religious bodies and other interest groups in the South-South, South-East and Lagos State to mobilize and encourage their citizens and wards to seek a career path in the Nigeria Police Force. “Interested applicants are urged to log on to the NPF recruitment portal to register before the expiration of the new deadline,” he said, adding that the recruitment exercise is absolutely free of charge.
