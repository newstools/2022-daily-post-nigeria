A Peoples Democratic Party chieftain in Giwa local government area of Kaduna State, Mustapha Jumomoh on Saturday decried the Kaduna- Kano road accident that claimed over 19 passengers. DAILY POST reported that 19 passengers died along Kaduna-Kano road on Thursday following a ghastly accident. The party chieftain in a statement said many road accidents were caused by drivers who engage in reckless driving in a bid to reach their destinations on time. He maintained that drivers under the influence of hard or illicit drugs endanger passengers knowing they are being controlled by such drugs. He said no human being with a sense of responsibility should drive above the recommended speed limit. He urged the Federal Road Safety (FRCN) to deploy officers both on the highway and on interior roads to avoid accidents that could claim lives.
