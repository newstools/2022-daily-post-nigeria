A Jos High Court has commenced hearing on the suit seeking to nullify the purported impeachment of Nuhu Abok Ayuba as the Speaker of the Plateau State House of Assembly. The suit, filed by Gwottson D. Fom, member representing Jos South Constituency, and Tyem Pirfa Jongfa, member representing Langtang Central, challenged the impeachment of Abok, describing it as illegal. The case which came up for hearing on Monday also joined Nuhu Abok Ayuba, Yakubu Sanda, Clerk of the House, Longbab Ponven Wuyep, Plateau State Government, Nigeria Police Force, NSCDC and 10 others in the suit. Counsel to the Nigeria Police Force, N.K Tali Esq appealed to the Court for time to enable the Police to respond to the claims. The lead Counsel to the claimants, Edward Pwajok SAN, agreed and did not oppose the application for an extension of time. Justice N. L Musa, thereafter, adjourned the case to the 15th day of March 2022 for hearing. DAILY POST recalls that Abok was impeached in October 2021, by 8 members of the State Assembly, which led to a controversy in the House. The House has been sitting at the old government house in Rayfield, Jos, since late 2021, following the incident. Plateau Impeachment Saga: How embattled Speaker, 11 others were whisked away
