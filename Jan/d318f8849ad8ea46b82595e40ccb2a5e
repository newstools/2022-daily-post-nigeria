The All Progressives Congress (APC) on Wednesday sealed a truce between Gombe Governor, Mohammed Yahaya and his predecessor, Danjuma Goje. Goje is the Senator representing Gombe Central in the National Assembly. The reconciliatory meeting was presided over by APC Caretaker Committee Chairman, Governor Mai Buni. In attendance were National Reconciliation Committee Chairman, Sen. Abdullahi Adamu and a member, Sen. Kashim Shettima. After the meeting, Buni expressed delight with the resolution of the issues between Yahaya and Goje. The Yobe Governor told reporters that the peace achieved has further stamped the authority of the APC in Gombe. “The party will continue to explore ways of resolving differences among stakeholders across the country for a united front ahead of the 2023 general elections. “I am indeed very happy with this development. This style would be replicated to solve the problems in other states,” he said. Speaking, Adamu commended the governor and his predecessor for placing the interest of the party and Gombe above theirs. The lawmaker appealed to their supporters to sheathe their swords, unite and allow peace to reign.
