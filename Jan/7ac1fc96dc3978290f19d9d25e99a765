Paul Merson has told Manchester United to appoint Brighton boss, Graham Potter as their manager. The former Arsenal star does not believe in anything Ralf Rangnick is doing at Old Trafford, insisting nothing has changed since the German took over from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. The former winger wonders why English managers are not given the chance of getting the jobs at big Premier League clubs “Manchester United are missing a trick overlooking Graham Potter – and so is the rest of the Premier League,” Merson wrote in his Daily Star column. He said, however, that it would be difficult for Manchester United to appoint the Englishman as their next manager. “It’s like English managers don’t exist for the big clubs so they’re hardly ever given a chance at the big jobs. “I’m not sure about Ralf Rangnick at all. He’s come in and everyone’s talking about him like he’s invented football and is some sort of genius. “United are as bad as they were under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer! Nothing’s changed, has it? Let’s be honest,” he said.
