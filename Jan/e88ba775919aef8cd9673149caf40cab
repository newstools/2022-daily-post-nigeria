The Organised Labour in Kogi State says it has called off the planned mass protest earlier slated for Thursday 27th January, 2022 against fuel subsidy removal by the Federal Government. The Kogi State Chairman, Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Onuh Edoka, announced this on Tuesday evening shortly after a virtual meeting with the national leadership of the congress. He said the cancellation of the nationwide protest was as a result of the Federal Government’s reversal of its earlier decision on fuel subsidy removal. He commended the cooperation of Kogi workers and civil society allies in the state, urging them to await further directive on the pending minimum wage struggle and other related matters.
