The Presidency has revealed the next government President Muhammadu Buhari the All Progressives Congress will continue in power beyond 2022. President Muhammadu Buhari’s spokesman, Garba Shehu, expressed the belief that his principal would hand over to another All Progressives Congress, APC-led government in 2023. Shehu spoke on Wednesday during the post-Federal Executive Council (FEC) briefing with journalists. He was reacting to reports that Buhari had extended the issue of fuel subsidy to the next administration. According to Shehu: “But she (the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Hajiya Zainab Ahmed) has answered you. Firstly, what this tells you is that the president is responsive and we are going to hand over to the next administration, APC, God willing.” The Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, had dismissed insinuations that the current government would remove subsidy on fuel.
