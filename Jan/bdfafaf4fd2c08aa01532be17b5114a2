Manchester United interim boss, Ralf Rangnick has identified Scott McTominay to captain the club in a few years’ time. Rangnick said this following McTominay’s impressive display in Man United’s FA Cup third round 1-0 victory over Aston Villa on Monday night. The German believes McTominay has what it takes to be captain of Man United in the next couple of years. McTominay delivered a man-of-the-match display against Aston Villa as he scored the only goal of the encounter to send Man United into the FA Cup fourth round. His header past Emi Martinez after connecting with Fred’s cross in the first half during the tie. “He’s an academy boy, his energy is amazing,” Rangnick said at his post-match press conference. “He now also starts scoring goals and also with some leadership skills. “I wouldn’t be surprised if in a couple of years he would be the captain of this team.”
