Lanre Gentry, the estranged husband of Nollywood actress, Mercy Aigbe, has clarified concerns about the paternity of their son, Olajuwon. Mercy Aigbe raised eyebrows on social media after she revealed her new lover, Kazim Adeoti, with a resemblance of the actress’ son and her new lover. Some people called for a DNA test over the striking resemblance. Gentry, reacting, confirmed that he’s the biological father of the child. His post on his Instagram page read thus, “What is life? I thank everyone for your comments and advice about my lovely son, Olajuwon Gentry. “My son is my son 100%. I love him so much. There is nothing in this world that can separate me from my children.” Recall that Aigbe and her ex-husband broke up in 2017 after the actress accused her husband of domestic violence.
