Arsenal and Aston Villa both confirmed Calum Chambers’ transfer on Thursday night in news that shocked every football fan. Chambers has made a handful of appearances for the Gunners this season, but remained a largely unused member of Mikel Arteta’s squad. Senior officials at the club have decided to offload him before his contract expires this summer. Chambers was highly unlikely to be handed an extension given his position in the squad. It is understood that no set transfer fee is involved in his move to Villa Park, just as would be the case in the summer. But with add ons, the deal could see Arsenal save £2million in total, as they also don’t have to pay his salary.
