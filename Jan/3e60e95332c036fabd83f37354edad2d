A former Secretary to the Oyo State Government, Barrister Sharafadeen Abiodun Alli, has said that former Governor Adebayo Alao-Akala was making efforts to reposition the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state. Alli made this disclosure in a statement made available to DAILY POST on Thursday. Our correspondent recalls that Alao-Akala died on Wednesday. The former Governor, who died at the age of 71, ruled the state as Governor between 2007 and 2011 under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). In 2015, Alao-Akala made efforts to return to the Agodi government house when he contested the gubernatorial election on the platform of the Action Democratic Party (ADP). Our correspondent recalls that Alao-Akala later joined APC in the buildup to the 2019 general elections. Alao-Akala was until his death, a chieftain of the APC. But Alli, while reacting to Alao-Akala’s death, explained that the former Governor was making efforts to reposition the APC in a bid to reclaim the state. Alli, who was the deputy gubernatorial candidate to Alao-Akala when the former Governor contested on the platform of ADP in 2015, insisted that APC would miss the one-time Governor. He added that Alao-Akala was a leader and boss with a pure heart and generous instinct. He described his death as a major setback to APC in the state. “This is a rude shock to me. I was close to Otunba Akala and I am down as I send this condolence message. I know our moves during our political sojourn in 2015 when I contested as his running mate in 2015. We were friends, brothers and political associates. “He was generous with a pure heart. Akala committed the state resources to human and state development,” he said. “Since he was appointed as a leader of our dear state, Akala has been making efforts to reposition our party. We all missed him”.
