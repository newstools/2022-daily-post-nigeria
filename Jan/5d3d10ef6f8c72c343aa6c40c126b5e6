River Plate striker, Julian Alvarez, is all but set to arrive in England after Manchester United are willing to pay the 21-year-old’s termination clause in January, according to Sport. Man United are looking to bring Alvarez to Old Trafford in January. The Premier League giants are willing to pay his €20 million termination clause. Alvarez, who is set to become Man United’s first signing this January, has made 96 appearances for River Plate since making his debut in October 2018. The Argentine has scored 36 goals and registered 25 assists for River Plate. The youngster has drawn the attention of top European clubs like Bayern Munich and Real Madrid. However, Manchester United are set to win the race for the forward, with Alvarez’s agent, Fernando Hidalgo, set to travel to England this week to complete the deal. Hidalgo is expected to fly to England soon to discuss a potential transfer to Ralf Rangnick’s side with River Plate, insisting they won’t sell for less than his asking price. Alvarez’s contract with River Plate will expire on December 31, 2022.
