Nigeria interim coach, Augustine Eguavoen, has said that his players should get the ‘most credit’ after defeating Guinea-Bissau at the ongoing 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) on Wednesday. Recall that the Super Eagles defeated Guinea-Bissau in their final Group D fixture on Wednesday night, thanks to goals from Umar Sadiq and William Troost-Ekong. Eguavoen’s men qualified as Group D winners with the maximum points. Nigeria will now face the best third-placed team from Groups B, E or F in the Round of 16. Speaking at his post-match press conference, Eguavoen said, “So, they [Guinea-Bissau] gave us a run for the money, but at the end of the day we were able to get those two goals and I am very satisfied with the performance. “The most credit must go to the players for doing everything we told them to do.” Meanwhile, Nigeria are already seen as favourites to win the trophy again alongside hosts Cameroon.
