Egypt captain, Mohamed Salah, has reacted to the Super Eagles’ early elimination at the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. Salah, who was the Man of the Match on Sunday as the Pharaohs defeated Morocco 2-1, said that Nigeria’s exit is proof of just how tough the tournament is. The Pharaohs will now face the host nation, Cameroon in the semi-final at the Stade d’Olembe on February 3. The Egypt captain, who scored one and assisted the winning goal for the seven-time champions, pointed to the example of Nigeria, who began the tournament as the favourites to lift the trophy but quickly disappeared after losing 1-0 to Tunisia in the last 16. “Nigeria had been the best team in the group stage and then they lost,” Salah told GOAL. “So you never know with any game. It’s tough for everyone. “Algeria lost in the group stage, having won it last time, and they had a great team. “Senegal qualified with one goal,” he added. “I’m not saying something bad, just that the tournament is tough.” The Super Eagles defeated Egypt in their very first game of Group D and followed that up with a victory over Sudan and Guinea Bissau.
