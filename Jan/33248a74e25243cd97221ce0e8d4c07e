The Katsina State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party has faulted the earlier announcement of the date for the local government elections in the State by Governor Aminu Masari. He said that it is the prerogative of the State Independent Electoral Commission to do so. The State party chairman disclosed this on Sunday at the Katsina PDP secretariat while receiving an aspirant, Sirajo Aminu, who came to formally indicate his interest in vying for the seat of the Central Senatorial District. According to Majigiri, the announcement is worrisome, adding that “if he (Governor Masari) is allowed to announce the time, he might end up also announcing the winners of the elections instead of the electoral body.” He said the responsibility of the governor in this regard was to approve the proposed plans and budgets for the election as submitted by the electoral commission but does not include usurping their functions. Majigiri urged the Katsina Governor to focus on his duties as provided by the law, Recall that Governor Masari while fielding questions from journalists at the State Government House recently revealed that the long-awaited local government election would be conducted in March 2022. Council polls in the State were last held over six years ago when the State was under the leadership of Governor Ibrahim Shehu Shema of the Peoples Democratic Party.
