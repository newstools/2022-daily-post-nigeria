Former Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr has reacted to Nigeria’s elimination from the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. The Eagles were defeated by Tunisia in the Round of 16 of the tournament. The Super Eagles lost to a depleted Tunisian team after Austine Eguavoen’s team raised the expectations of many following their group stage performance. Rohr also said he was impressed by the display of Taiwo Awoniyi and pointed out why the Union Berlin striker did not do so well in the tournament. “Nigeria was disappointing – losing to a weakened Tunisia in the Round of 16 came as a surprise. “Although Taiwo Awoniyi from Union Berlin played a very good tournament,” Rohr told Sportschau, a German sports magazine on broadcaster ARD. “You could see his potential, but there was still a lack of coordination with the team – he hasn’t been there very long.” Rohr was sacked weeks to the tournament in Cameroon following a series of not too impressive results during the 2022 World Cup qualifiers.
