Suspected Gunmen on Monday night opened fire on residents of Sabon Birni community in Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna State and killed seven family members. A resident who spoke to DAILY POST on Tuesday, Mallam Yunusa Yahaya said he escaped from the community and that the causality could have been more but for the quick intervention of security operatives who also exchanged fire with the bandits. Also, a community leader, Bello Musa, told DAILY POST that many residents of the village have fled from their homes due to fear of being attacked or killed by the marauding bandits. He, however, appealed to the federal government to deploy more troops to Igabi and other troubled zones in Kaduna State to protect the people from further attacks. Bandit attacks have been on the increase since January 1, 2022, residents claim. Meanwhile, the Kaduna Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige did not pick his calls nor respond to text messages sent to him to confirm the development.
