Uche Mefor, former Deputy Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has said a Nigerian president of Igbo extraction won’t stop the agitation for Biafra. Mefor said a Nigerian president of Igbo extraction would instead further intensify the agitation for Biafra. The former IPOB deputy leader made the remark in a post on his Facebook page. Mefor’s post reads partly: “This is very unlikely. An Igbo president of Nigeria will even intensify the agitation for the restoration of Biafra. “Biafrans must concentrate on the Biafra Territorial politics with a view to controlling the political space in Biafraland. “Nigeria is an ideal candidate, would be completing the cycle of the status of an ideal contender highly and likely to be subjected to remedial secession if she mishandles the Igbo bid for presidency and denies or scheme them out.” Lately, Igbo political stakeholders have been agitating that the Southeast be allowed to produce Nigeria’s next president.
