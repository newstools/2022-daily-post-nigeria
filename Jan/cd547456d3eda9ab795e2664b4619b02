The member representing Obudu/Bekwara/Obanliku federal constituency, Legor Idagbo, has reportedly ordered the arrest and detention of the legal adviser to All Progressives Congress in Cross River State, Barrister Pius Awa. Awa was said to have been detained at the Obudu police station. According to sources within the party, Awa was alleged to have diverted ten motorcycles which were parts of the Christmas and New Year gift items from Idagbo for his constituents. Awa was the chairman of the organising committee for the empowerment. Some of the party members spoken to said Idagbo was furious when the bikes were not produced for distribution as earmarked. Consequently, they said the lawmaker ordered for his arrest. “It was from the detention that he now produced the remaining two before he was released”, a committee member said. Meanwhile, Pius Awa has denied the allegation, explaining that the ten motorcycles taken to the Obudu police station for safe custody because the boys were rowdy and wanted to disrupt the festivity and cart the bikes away. “I wasn’t detained. There were issues surrounding the bikes Legor Idagbor have for empowerment. We were to distribute them to ten wards but problems arose that certain wards should not benefit. So I had to run to run to the police to custody the bikes. Then Idagbor directed that they should be distributed. I did not steal them as alleged.”
