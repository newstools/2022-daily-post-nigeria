A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo State, Engineer Oyedele Hakeem Alao, has declared that the Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Saliu Akanmu Adetunji, joined his ancestors when his wealth of experience and wisdom was needed most. Alao, who contested the gubernatorial election on the platform of Alliance for Democracy (AD) in 2019, made this declaration via a statement made available to DAILY POST on Sunday. DAILY POST recalls that the monarch, who ascended the throne in March 2016, joined his ancestors in the early hours of Sunday. The monarch died at the age of 93 at the University College Hospital (UCH) Ibadan. Alao, in his reaction, has however said that the monarch died at a time when his experience and wisdom was needed most. Alao, who recently joined the APC described the death of the monarch as painful. He explained that the passage of the monarch is a great loss to the people of Ibadanland, Oyo State and Nigeria as a whole. He said despite his old age, his death coming at this time is a rude shock. Alao described Olubadan as a great leader who brought his wisdom and wealth of experience to bear in discharging his responsibilities as the Olubadan of Ibadanland. He noted that his name would continue to be a reference in the ancient city. “The news of the death of our royal father, His Imperial Majesty, Oba Saliu Adetunji, Aje Ogungunniso I, came to me as a shock. “His exit at this time when his wealth of experience and wisdom for the growth and development of Ibadanland is needed is painful, to say the least as he served Ibadanland with all he had. “There is no doubt in my mind that Ibadanland, Oyo State, Nigeria and humanity at large will miss Oba Adetunji, pride of our heritage,” he said. “I commiserate with all Ibadan indigenes both at home and in Diaspora, his immediate family, the Central Council of Ibadan Indigenes (CCII) and the Olubadan in Council, on the demise of our revered royal father.”
