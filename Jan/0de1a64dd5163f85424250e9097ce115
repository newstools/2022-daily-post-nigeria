Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has insisted that he won the 2019 election in the state by a landslide. Ganduje made the remark in response to claims by former governor of the state, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso that he was imposed on the state. Kwankwaso had alleged that Ganduje was imposed on the people of the state by some powerful forces because he lost his re-election bid in 2019. Reacting, Ganduje, through his Commissioner for Information, Malam Muhammad Garba, said, “You goff because I won a landslide victory attested by even the international communities”. Garba noted that Kwankwaso managed a “well-organized election rigging network, particularly in the metropolitan local governments, where youth, mostly without even voters’ card were engaged to perpetrate the electoral frauds.” He said it was “vividly clear that barely hours into the voting, most of the ballot boxes were said to have been stuffed, only for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to discover that either card readers were not used or the voters are not captured in its data and therefore had to cancel the results from many centres and declared the election inconclusive.”
