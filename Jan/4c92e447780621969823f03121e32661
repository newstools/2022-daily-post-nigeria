An Ogun State Magistrate Court sitting in Ado, Ado Odo Ota Local Government Area of the state, has remanded Mrs Elizabeth Joseph, mother of Joshua Joseph, a student of Toyan High School, Ere, for reportedly attacking her son’s teachers on Tuesday. DAILY POST reported earlier that the student, his mother and some thugs had invaded the school to attack teachers, who had told him to cut his reprimanded by his teacher for his hair. Three teachers were said to have been beaten, while a car belonging to a teacher was also smashed. This incident came after the boy and his father had signed an undertaking as directed by the State Government, following cases of incessant attacks on teachers in Ogun. After listening to the Prosecutor, Inspector Adeyemo, the Magistrate, B.O AbdulSalam, said she was disappointed with the attitude of some parents, who are fond of going to their children’s school to brutalise teachers for scolding their wards. The Magistrate said, “Why are these children attacking their teachers? If a drastic measure is not taken, these are the kind of youths that will become a menace to the society. “If my parents had followed me to my school to fight my teachers, will I be on this bench today?” While admitting that the offence was bailable, she, however, directed that the suspects be remanded in correctional homes. She also directed that the student, who is now at large, should be produced during the next court sitting. The case has since been adjourned till February 15, 2022.
