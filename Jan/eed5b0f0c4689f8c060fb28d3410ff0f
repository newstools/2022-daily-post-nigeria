A 14-year-old boy (name withheld) has narrowly escaped being killed by his neighbour, who allegedly wanted to use him for ritual purposes. The incident happened at Ubomiri community, in Mbaitoli Local Government Area of Imo State last Friday. The 40-year-old suspect from Anambra State, who is now in police custody, reportedly invited the boy to his apartment within the neighbourhood for an errand. On arrival to his abode, the unsuspecting young boy met his assailant who is also his father’s friend in the neighborhood blaring loud music from his home theatre. DAILY POST gathered that after ushering him into his apartment, he jammed the door and hit him with a machete and wanted to push the 14year-old into an already dug grave in his room at Ubomiri. The assailant, neighbours said, was also attempting to chop off the boy’s head from his body, a situation that led to stiff resistance and commotion. The screams from the victim attracted neighbours who forcefully broke down the door and rescued him, before handing the ritualist over to police operatives. The boy, who was said to have sustained some cuts, is receiving medical attention at an undisclosed hospital. DAILY POST also gathered that the assailant before the development, sends the boy on errand from time to time. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), in the State, Michael Abattam confirmed the incident. He noted that the suspect was currently undergoing police investigation in the State.
