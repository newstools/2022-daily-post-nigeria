Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has urged Nigerians with convincing medical evidence of Bola Tinubu, a presidential aspirant to speak out. ACF said Nigerians with Tinubu’s medical evidence should come out and show that he is not fit to contest the Presidency on health grounds. Spokesman of ACF, Emmanuel Yawe, said the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, should not be allowed to run for the Presidency without providing his medical evidence. The APC National Leader on Monday hinted on vying for the highest political office in the country. The former Lagos State Governor informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his life-long dream which is to run for the Presidency. However, Yawe said Nigerians must be saved from the agony of having a President with health challenges. In a statement, Yawe said: “If people have issues or evidence about his (Tinubu) health, let them come out and speak. Let them provide evidence that he is not strong enough to contest for the Presidency or hold the office. “The people who have the evidence that Tinubu is not strong enough for the office of Presidency should save us the agony of having a sick President in office. They should speak out.” The ACF spokesman pointed out the late former President Umaru Yar’Adua, who was sick and died in office, created a constitutional crisis. “So, if we know that somebody is sick, we should not allow him to take over that office. It is a serious office that will determine the future of millions of citizens. In a complex country like Nigeria, we should not allow somebody that is not medically fit to occupy such an office and mess all of us up. “President Muhammadu Buhari is always travelling abroad for medical attention, and Nigerians would be organizing demonstrations to force him back home. It was really embarrassing. We should not allow such things to happen again,” Yawe said. Last year, Tinubu had spent months abroad after he had surgery. While recuperating, Buhari visited him in London.
