Professor Remi Sonaiya has criticized the comment by All Progressives Congress (APC) leader, Bola Tinubu, at the Presidential Villa on Monday. Tinubu visited President Muhammadu Buhari to declare his desire to lead the country in 2023. Speaking to State House correspondents, the politician explained why he was interested in the topmost position. The former two-term Governor of Lagos State disclosed that becoming the President of Nigeria has been his lifelong ambition. In her reaction, Sonaiya said such a description should not be used by an aspirant who intends to serve the masses. She warned Nigerians to “wise up”, noting that the APC stalwart’s revelation is “instructive”. “Tinubu’s avowed reason for running is merely to fulfil a “lifelong ambition”. “There wasn’t a word about serving the people. That’s instructive. #WiseUpNigeria!”, Sonaiya tweeted. The educationalist and writer was the presidential candidate of the KOWA Party in the 2015 general elections.
