Ohanaeze Ndigbo worldwide has accused the Arewa Consultative Forum, ACF, and the Northern Elders Forum of being the reason behind President Muhammadu Buhari’s refusal to release Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB. The group said it had once predicted that the President will not release Kanu in its New Year message to Ndigbo, because, according to it, there are infighting evidence, misguided assertions and utterances of certain southeastern leaders and IPOB itself. Ohanaeze said it has been sounding the warning that the approach, assertions and infighting in the camp of IPOB and amongst Igbo leaders will derail the release of Kanu through diplomatic efforts. Ohanaeze claimed those who were sent to negotiate the unconditional release of the IPOB leader changed the course along the line and seized the opportunity to chase their personal gains. Ohanaeze further claimed some Igbo political leaders and other people around Kanu are secretly benefiting from the president’s nonchalant posture of not applying the political solution for Kanu’s reasons. Furthermore, Ohanaeze claimed that “Arewa Consultative Forum, ACF and Northern Elders Forum, NEF, are behind President Buhari’s refusal to grant Nnamdi Kanu a political solution with evil intent to disorganize and set the South-East ablaze ahead of the 2023 Presidency. “Nnamdi Kanu’s trials will bring the untold tragedy of tensions and disastrous violence to the Southeast,” Ohanaeze said in a statement signed by Okechukwu Isiguzoro, its Secretary-General.
