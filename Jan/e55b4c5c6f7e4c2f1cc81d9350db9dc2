Malam Ismail Bello on Monday dragged one Hafsat Auwal before a Shari’a court in Kaduna for allegedly abducting his wife and child. Bello, a 40-year old man, told the court that Auwal, his wife’s aunt, connived with another woman to kidnap his wife and her one-day-old child. He urged the court to compel them to return her and his baby. Bello also begged the court to order them to pay him damages, saying that the incident made him worried. Auwal, on her part, told the court that they took the wife to her parent’s house after giving birth as requested by them to take care of her properly for a while before she returns home. The presiding judge, Malam Salisu Abubakar Tureta, ordered that the matter should not be entertained in the court, saying that it was a matter that has to do with the family.
