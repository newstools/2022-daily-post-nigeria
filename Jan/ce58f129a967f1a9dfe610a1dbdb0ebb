Stakeholders from the Northern part of the county, under the aegis of Northern Leaders of Thought in Kaduna, have warned Nigerians against electing politicians like President Muhammadu Buhari in the forthcoming 2023 general elections. The group, led by the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) issued the warning through Dr Hakeem Baba Ahmed of the Northern Elders Forum, during a keynote address at a meeting held at the Arewa House Kaduna on Saturday. He urged eligible voters in the north to ensure that they are properly registered to vote out the likes of President Buhari in 2023. He said the lives of northerners would be in danger if the likes of Buhari becomes the next Nigerian president, urging electorates not to sell their votes. While urging Northerners not to make the ”mistake of 2015″, he said “many think voting another set of leaders will add no value to their lives. “We say turn your anger into an asset by voting in better people into office this time. There are politicians that will continue where the present administration stopped, and, while angry citizens refuse to vote, they will buy votes and get power.” ”So, the most important thing a Northerner will do for himself and the community is to register and vote in 2023. Do not exchange your votes for another four or eight years in a country where your dignity and your life have little value.”
