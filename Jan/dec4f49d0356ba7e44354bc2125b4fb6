Asari Dokubo, a former Niger Delta militant leader, has described Nnamdi Kanu and his group, the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, as worse than terrorists. Dokubo described Kanu and IPOB as a satanic movement. The leader of the Niger Delta Peoples Salvation Force (NDPSF), frowned against the sit-at-home order usually imposed across the Southeast during Kanu’s court proceedings. Speaking on Sunday during a Facebook live, Dokubo said residents of the Southeast obey the order for fear of being killed and not because they love Kanu and IPOB. He accused Kanu of being responsible for closure of schools and businesses in the Southeast. According to Dokubo: “IPOB said Igbo people should not go about their businesses; they should not go to school. So, if we Igbos no longer go about our businesses and go to school, what else should we be doing? That’s why all the boys are going into fraud. “IPOB is worse than a terrorist organisation. It is a satanic movement. They tell them to eat the flesh of human beings, and they eat it. It is not because you people are powerful. They don’t know you people are nothing. “People are afraid of being killed, that’s why they’ve continued to sit at home; not because they love Nnamdi Kanu.” IPOB had consistently ordered a sit-at-home in the Southeast region, whenever Kanu appeared in court. During these sit-at-home, market places and schools are shut down, thereby bringing the economic activities of the region to a standstill.
