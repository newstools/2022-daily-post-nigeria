For this the whole world will know that there is God that fights for the oppressed. “Dear lord, let your wrath fall on all of them. “Let them know that I serve you. Let them experience what I am passing through in the mighty name of Jesus. “They will know that there are some people they that are untouchable. The whole world, Nigeria, let them know that you love me, let them know that you are the one fighting my battle. “Arise and avenge the death of my son. I depend on you alone Jehovah God. Arise and fight this battle in Jesus mighty name I pray.”
