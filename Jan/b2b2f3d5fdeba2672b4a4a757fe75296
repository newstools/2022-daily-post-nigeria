Ayo Adebanjo, leader of the Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, has given reasons why the group will not support Bola Tinubu or some other Presidential candidates. Adebanjo said Afenifere will not support Tinubu or any candidate until the constitution is changed. He noted that until the country is restructured, the group won’t queue behind any presidential candidate. Addressing journalists in Lagos, Adebanjo, stressed that Tinubu has the right to run for the presidency in 2023. Speaking on Tinubu’s presidential ambition, Adebanjo said: “Your man has every right to contest the election, he is not disabled, so what is the big deal about that? “We are not contending who is the President now because we don’t believe in the constitution that we have. Until that constitution is changed, then we will talk about where the President will be. “We have no candidate now until that constitution is changed because I don’t want to go on an uncharted sea that is the implication now. “You must believe in the constitution before you say I want to be a part of it. I am not going to be part of the constitution or election that operates a military constitution. That’s the bone of contention and which President Buhari himself has not disputed. The constitution we have is a military one.” Tinubu had on Monday made his presidential ambition public. The former governor of Lagos State had informed President Muhammadu Buhari officially of his intention to run for the Presidency. He had disclosed his ambition after a meeting with Buhari at the State House, Abuja.
