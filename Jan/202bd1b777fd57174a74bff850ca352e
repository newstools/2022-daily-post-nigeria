The Rapid Response Squad (RRS) of the Lagos Police Command has arrested three persons for dispossessing a pedestrian, Yusuph Ahmed, of N100,000 and other belongings. Ridwan Imran (20), Lukman Abiodun (18) and Abdulahi Isa (18) had approached the victim and robbed him. Led by Abiodun, they stopped the complainant at about 9pm on Wednesday in Isheri – Berger Garage. Other members of the gang are still at large. A statement on RRS Facebook page said the attackers harassed and chased their target to Agege Stadium, smashed a bottle on his head and pushed him inside the drainage. Apart from the cash, they stole three mobile phones and a wristwatch, all estimated at over N600,000. Ahmed explained that one of his customers gave him the N100,000 to refurbish a Sienna car. “I got to Isheri – Berger Garage where they (pointing to Ridwan Imran and Lukman Abiodun) ordered me to give them money for food. “I pleaded with them that I had no money on me. Within a twinkle of an eye, they mobilized their colleagues, apparently lurking around. “They were about six, I had to flee. They chased me from Isheri – Berger Garage to Agege stadium. They beat me ceaselessly and broke a bottle on my head,” he disclosed. The citizen said God answered his prayers because he had given up hope of surviving the assault. RRS Commander, CSP Olayinka Egbeyemi assured that all the perpetrators involved in the crime would be prosecuted.
