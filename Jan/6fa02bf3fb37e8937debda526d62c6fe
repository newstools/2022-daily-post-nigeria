Former Chelsea winger, Jimmy Smith, is dead at the age of 91. Chelsea announced his death in a statement on their official website on Friday evening ahead of their FA Cup tie with Chesterfield on Saturday. The statement read in part, “Chelsea Football Club is greatly saddened to learn of the passing of our former player Jimmy Smith at the age of 91. We send our deepest condolences to his family and friends. “A Sheffield-born winger, Jimmy joined Chelsea from the army in 1951 and made 23 appearances, scoring three times. “His debut came in a local derby at Stamford Bridge in September 1951 when we beat Fulham 2-1, with Jimmy joined in the attack that day by goalscorers Roy Bentley and namesake Bobby Smith. “He scored himself in his second and third games, another 2-1 home victory, this time against Huddersfield, and an away 3-5 loss at Wolves. “His final appearance in the first team came in October 1953. He moved on to Leyton Orient in May 1955 but was always immensely proud of representing the Blues. “Jimmy was believed to have been Chelsea’s oldest surviving former player; that honour now falls to Len Casey.”
