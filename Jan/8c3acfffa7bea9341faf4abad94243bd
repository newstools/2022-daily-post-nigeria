The Chief of Defence Staff has commended Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike for “taking the bull by the horn” in the fight against oil bunkering in the state. The Defence Chief said there is the need for other governors in the south south region to toe the path of Governor Wike, in ensuring that the region is rid of illegal oil refining. Irabor made the comments on Friday when he paid a courtesy visit to the Governor in the Government House, Port Harcourt. He said he was in the state as part of his tour to military formations across the Niger Delta region. The CDS said the military had long wanted such a government focused strategy towards the security of oil and gas assets and hoped that other governors would emulate it. He noted that the fight against bunkering will be escalated after he speaks with his men. On his part, Governor Nyesom Wike explained that illegal crude oil refinery operators are causing great health hazards to residents in the state and destroying the national economy. He, therefore, called on the CDS to direct his men in the state to join in the fight. “You and I know that one product we have today that has kept this country going is oil and gas, which I will say is the main source of our revenue in this country today. “And so, we must as a people, as a government, it doesn’t matter whichever faction you may be or whichever divide you may be, or you may find yourself. What is important is that you must defend any of our national assets.”
