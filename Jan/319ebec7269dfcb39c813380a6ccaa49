Nollywood actress, Toyin Abraham has slammed critics assuming that her husband, Kolawole Ajeyemi, is poor. There were talks in some corners that the actress was the one funding her husband’s lifestyle and family. The actress, in an Instagram post, noted that the fact that her husband is not as popular as she is doesn’t mean he is not capable. She added that whatever her husband has was from his hard work and not due to her popularity. Toyin wrote, “I don’t usually do this and I’m only going to address this just once and I hope this ends here. “People need to stop this mentality that famous people or the more famous ones are the richest in their family, relationships or even friendships. “Just because some people don’t like to blow their own horns doesn’t mean they should be seen as less or incapable. “I’m speaking up because I won’t let people talk down on my husband who is a very hard working man and is doing a lot for me and the kids. Do not ridicule his hard work and what he stands for.”
