A gang fight in Minna, Niger State capital has claimed the lives of one policeman and a businessman. The state government and security agencies seem to be unable to find a solution to these fights that have led to the loss of lives and properties in the state. DAILY POST learned that the fight is usually between youths of different areas who choose the streets of Minna as their battlefield. The clash that started on Thursday between the youthS of Limawa and Ogbomosho areas could not be controlled by the sect personnel. The youths regrouped themselves and disrupted the Minna central area, thereby affecting owners that had to lock their shops and run for their safety. It was in the process of the clash that one of the traders whose shop was located along Ogbomosho Road was stabbed and later died in the hospital. The report on how the policeman died is not clear as some claimed that he was mistakenly killed by his colleague, while others believed the warring youths killed him. Most of the shops still remained closed in the area. Recently, gang clashes have become a daily affair, making residents and commuters live in fear as the fights occur on major roads with gang members fighting with dangerous weapons. DSP Wasiu Abiodun, the state Police Public Relations Officer could not ascertain the incident when a call was put to his phone.
