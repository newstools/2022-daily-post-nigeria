Three persons have been feared dead in Ondo State following an attack on a community in Ose Local Government Area of the State. The community, Molege village was said to have been attacked by herders over the refusal of villagers to allow herdsmen graze on farmlands in the community with their cows.

We urge the people of the community to come back to their homes as peace has returned to the village. Adetunji was however silence on the casualties recorded during the forceful invasion of the village by the attackers.
