Egypt captain, Mohamed Salah, has finally spoken about his side’s defeat to Nigeria at the ongoing 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON. Salah insisted that Egypt had to rearrange themselves after their 2021 AFCON opening 1-0 loss to Nigeria. Recall that Nigeria defeated Egypt 1-0 in their first 2021 AFCON encounter on January 11 at the Roumdé Adjia Stadium, Garoua. Kelechi Iheanacho scored the only goal of the match in the first half to give Augustine Eguavoen’s men all three points against Egypt. Speaking after Egypt defeated Guinea-Bissau 1-0 on Saturday night, the Liverpool forward told CAFonline. “We have a new coach and a new generation. “After the defeat against Nigeria, we had to rearrange ourselves. We will fight in this tough competition and believe in our chances and where we can go.” The result against Guinea-Bissau means Egypt moved to second position in Group D. The North Africans are three points behind Nigeria who earlier booked their knockout stage place with a convincing 3-1 over Sudan.
