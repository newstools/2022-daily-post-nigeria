Delta State Governor, Arthur Ifeanyi Okowa has urged political aspirants to seek the face of God in the positions they’re vying for ahead of the 2023 elections. Governor Okowa gave the advice at a thanksgiving service at the Government House Chapel, Asaba. He said, “pray with us, pray for us and pray about the State.” “Whatever positions we are contesting for, let us seek the face of God because if you genuinely pray God will reveal His will for you. “As a man, I will also try to avoid people pushing me to a direction that God is not pleased with because if God has made a choice and we go in the wrong direction, it will not augur well for the State.” He cautioned political stakeholders on the need to concentrate on governance and not be distracted ahead of the 2023 general elections. “Let us approach the next few months with the oneness of love. Towards the end of every administration, there are usually distractions here and there. “But one thing is sure, whoever will succeed me must be one who keeps the fire in this altar burning, and God must direct me on the choice of the person. “I can never take the place of God in deciding who will succeed me; I will pray for God to direct me and not a man so that I don’t go in the wrong direction”. Governor Okowa also appealed to politicians as well as stakeholders to pray for the oneness and unity in the state.
