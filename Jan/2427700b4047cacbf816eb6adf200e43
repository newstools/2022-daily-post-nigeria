The Zamfara State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has called on Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle to resign, saying that his government does not have the interest of the people at heart. Addressing newsmen at the secretariat in Gusau, the state capital, the chairman of the party, Hon. Bala Mande spoke through his deputy, Professor Kabiru Jabaka, stressing that the state is on fire due to banditry while Matawalle is in Niger Republic enjoying himself. “Even if he claims to be there because of security reasons, then this is not the right time for that tour,” he said. According to him, over 50 innocent citizens were killed and kidnapped just last week, adding that there is no single Internally Displaced Persons camp in the state. Continuing, the chairman explained that all the schools in the state have been shut down and school children are roaming the streets aimlessly. He said that Matawalle’s carefree attitude to the welfare and security of their lives has become a public concern, pointing out that the present administration prefers comfort for themselves rather than for the masses. Speaking further, the state chairman of the party challenged the governor to pinpoint one capital project he has commissioned, stressing that it is very unfortunate that a civilian governor would spend almost three years on seat without commissioning a single project. “The present actors in the state have chosen comfort as their primary objective of leadership contrary to the provision of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,” he said. The party, therefore, called on the present administration to be sensitive rather than treating the citizens with a mere wave of the hand.
