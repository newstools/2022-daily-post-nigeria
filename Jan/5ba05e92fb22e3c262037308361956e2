Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel, has hailed the individual qualities of Manchester City’s playmaker, Kevin De Bruyne. Tuchel said the Belgian was the difference between both teams, as City won 1-0 on Saturday. De Bruyne shrugged off a challenge from N’Golo Kante to fire in the winner at the Etihad, as the champions went 12 points clear at the top of the table. Speaking to Sky Sports after the game, Tuchel said: “We need consistency. We could have had much more chances if we played with better timing, better precision. “That you miss chances, there is no problem in that, but we could have had much more chances. That’s what I’m critical about. The ball losses were too early and too poor and the decision-making was not on the level we need. “The individual quality of Kevin De Bruyne made the difference today but we struggled to show the quality to really hurt them and score the first goal and bring some doubts into their game.”
