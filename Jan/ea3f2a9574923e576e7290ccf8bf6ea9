The Leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, has said former Governor of Imo State, Emeka Ihedioha should prepare to govern the state. Primate Ayodele said Ihedioha should prepare to return to power because he will restore the lost glory of Imo State. He urged the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to give Ihedioha the governorship ticket if they want to win the election. In a statement by his Media Aide, Oluwatosin Osho, the clergyman said he saw the hands of God on Ihedioha. ‘’Emeka Ihedioha should get prepared, if PDP wants to win, they should give it to him, he will bring back the lost glory of the state. ‘’I see the hand of God on Emeka Ihedioha, he will govern Imo state again,’’ he said. Ihedioha was ousted from power by the Supreme Court after he won the last governorship election in the state. The Supreme Court had declared Hope Uzodinma governor of the state instead of Ihedioha.
