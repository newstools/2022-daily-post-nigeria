The kidnappers of six family members of the Taraba State former Secretary to the State Government (SSG) have freed their victims. The victims, it would be recalled, were abducted in Jamtari village of Gashaka Local Government Area last week when they were on their way back from Sardauna local government, where they had gone during the yuletide. The former SSG, who made the information available to DAILY POST, on Wednesday via a WhatsApp message said they were all released in the early hours of today. Appreciating God for His intervention, he said “today, 12 January, 2022, at about 3 a.m after eight agonizing and traumatic days in captivity, the almighty God, who is the way maker, miracle worker and light in the darkness has again answered the numerous prayers of the faithful and delivered them from the captive.” Though it could not be ascertained whether ransoms were paid, he confirmed that the victims are now at home “following a negotiated release,and have commenced the necessary medical examinations and trauma therapy.” Kataps and his wife, Clara who is the present Chief Registrar of the State High Court, it would be recalled, narrowly escaped being kidnapped that fateful day that their family members, which include three of their children, two of their nieces and their driver were kidnapped. Emmanuel Kataps, David Kataps, Esabella Kataps, Esther Geofry, Rita David and Bala Magaji were the kidnapped family members said to have regained freedom.
