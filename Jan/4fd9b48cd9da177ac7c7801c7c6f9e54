Former England international, Alan Smith, has predicted the clubs that will finish top-four in the Premier League table this season. Man City are currently on top of the Premier League table. Chelsea are in the second position ahead of third-place Liverpool and fourth-place West Ham. But Smith believes Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal will finish in the Premier League top-four this season ahead of Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United. “There’s a seven-point gap to Liverpool in third, so it looks like it will be difficult to catch Jurgen Klopp’s side, Chelsea and the league leaders Manchester City,” Smith told Sky Sports. “I know there are games in hand for plenty of teams, but City, Chelsea and Liverpool are the three best teams in the country. “Pep Guardiola’s side are the best by some distance, to be honest, but those three teams will make up the top three I am sure.” Smith added: “It’s a really difficult one to call. I can’t see Manchester United doing it. I just can’t see them getting there with the way they have been playing. “There might be a resurgence, we will wait and see, but there seem to be too many problems to fix at Old Trafford at the moment. “For me, it might just be between the two north London clubs, Arsenal and Tottenham, which would be very interesting. “Perhaps West Ham’s squad might just not be strong enough, especially if Michail Antonio picked up an injury. “Obviously, Spurs have got a couple of games in hand and were they to win those, they would go above the Gunners, but I’m just going to side with Arsenal. “I’m going with Arteta’s side because they have come a long way this season and there is a tight team spirit at the Emirates Stadium. “There is less to sort out there than at Tottenham, so that is why I will go for my former team.”
