Super Eagles star, Kelechi Iheanacho, has revealed that he and his teammates were gutted with the sack of former Nigeria coach, Gernot Rohr. The Leicester City forward said this following Nigeria’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, 1-0 victory against Egypt on Tuesday. Recall that the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) recently sacked Gernot Rohr and appointed Jose Peseiro as the new permanent handler of the Super Eagles. Interim Super Eagles coach, Austin Eguavoen will hand over to Peseiro after the 2021 AFCON in Cameroon. Speaking after Nigeria defeated Egypt, Iheanacho, who won the man of the match award, said this at the post-match conference as per Victor Modo: “We were really gutted that the former coach [Gernot Rohr] left, and we got a new manager. “But as professionals, we need to always be focused on our games. We are not going to get distracted, and hopefully, he is going to find a place to move forward in his coaching career.” Iheanacho, who scored the only goal of the match against Egypt, will hope to lead Nigeria to victory when they take on Sudan in their next game this weekend.
