Arsenal has accepted a £20,000 fine for failing to control their players during a 2-1 defeat to Manchester City on New Year’s Day. The Gunners were handed the charge from the Football Association (FA) for the conduct of their players, after referee Stuart Atwell’s decision to show Gabriel Magalhaes a second yellow card, only two minutes after he awarded City a penalty. “Arsenal FC has been fined £20,000 after admitting a charge for a breach of FA rule E20.1 and accepting the standard penalty. “The club failed to ensure that its players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion during the 59th minute of its Premier League fixture against Manchester City FC,” an FA statement read: Gabriel picked up both yellow cards within two minutes of each other. The first was for his reaction to the penalty, as Gabriel was one of many Arsenal stars surrounding Atwell after he had pointed to the spot. The second followed quickly after the Brazilian clattered into Gabriel Jesus on the halfway line in a poor attempt to halt another City attack.
