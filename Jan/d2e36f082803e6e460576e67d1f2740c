Three days after the Nigerian Army suddenly withdrew its personnel from Correctional Centres across Ondo State, the soldiers have returned. The return of the soldiers was disclosed by Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu on Saturday night. Akeredolu, had on Wednesday, raised the alarm over the action of the soldiers after he expressed worries that the move could encourage jailbreak. According to the Governor, who described the return as a welcome development, the Nigerian Army has allowed good reasoning to prevail in the interest of the people. While stressing that the initial withdrawal of the personnel from the Correctional Centres was an aberration and an undue security risk, Akeredolu in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, CPS, Richard Olatunde, said the security of lives and property of the people remained an onerous task that must be carried out without hesitation or sentiment. “A federal facility like the Correctional Centre should not have been left without deserving security for any reason. However, the return of the soldiers to the facilities is a positive development. “Both the Nigerian Army and the Correctional Centres belong to the Federal Government. There must be continuous synergy. We will also continue to do our best to give the necessary support when the need arises,” he said.
