In its effort to settle the rift between the factions of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun State, the party’s reconciliation committee visited Abeokuta on Friday. The committee, led by Senator Abdullahi Adamu, met separately with Governor Dapo Abiodun and his predecessor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun in the state capital. The committee, which earlier met Abiodun at the presidential lodge, later met with Amosun at the Mitros Residences, a State government-owned lodge. DAILY POST recalls that the duo of Abiodun and Amosun factions had on October 16 held parallel state congresses, as hoodlums fired gunshots at the Ake Palace Ground to disperse loyalists of Sen. Amosun. In order to restore peace between the warring factions, the national leadership of the APC had set up the reconciliation committee that visited both groups today. When asked after the meeting if there is a sharing formula to appease the two factions, Adamu said, “there is no sharing formula,” adding that, “What to take home in the name of God and most sincerely is that we got here around 11:00am, we have been to the government house to greet His Excellency and to announce formally that we are in Ogun State on the mandate of our committee.” He, however, expressed optimism that the crisis between the duo would be settled after listening to their individual grievances. “It’s a practice we have adopted to always talk first so that we can have the cracks of the issues raised, something to explain to us what was raised in their petition. We have just accomplished that and after this, we would also go to the Governor’s side. “Yes, we are here to treat the petition. I am more than optimistic that all these will be resolved,” he assured.
