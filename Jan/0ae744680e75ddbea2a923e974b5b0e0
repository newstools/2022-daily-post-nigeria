The Senior Pastor of Dunamis International Gospel Centre, Paul Enenche has declared the judgement of God on killers and terrorists in Nigeria. Enenche said killers and their sponsors will not escape the judgment of God this year. He disclosed this during the church’s Wednesday service at DIGC Headquarters in Abuja. Enenche declared that war will soon break out in the camps of killers in the country. According to Enenche: “Killers and their sponsors won’t go free this year, before this 21 days fast is over, we shall hear news of fight and destruction in their camps. “No killer devil shall escape this year. Anywhere they are, they shall begin to die en masse. “We declare that the earth shall begin to reject killers and terrorists terrorizing our land.”
