Bako Kure, a resident of Gusau, Zamfara State capital, was reportedly killed by suspected gunmen as they stormed the Damban area on Monday night. According to eyewitnesses, the suspected terrorists invaded Sabo Gariin Damban at about 11:10 pm, trying to break into the residence of one of the community members. Kure was shot dead while he was responding to a distress call by his neighbour. One of the daughters of the deceased, Hauwa Bako explained that their father was killed while he was trying to help. “The incident is still a shock and surprising to us because our father had no problem with anybody,” she lamented. Commenting on the incident, the Chairman, Zamfara State wing of the Southern Peoples Union (SOKAPU), Mr. Barnabas Wuyah, said the incident was unfortunate and sad indeed. Bako Kure hailed from Kwoi Local Government Area of Kaduna State. Efforts to reach the Zamfara State Police Command for comments were unsuccessful as the phone lines of the Police Public Relations Officer, SP Mohammed Shehu, were unreachable.
