Bandits in their numbers at about 10pm on Tuesday stormed Makurdi community in Malumfashi Local Government Area of Katsina State, killed two persons and abducted a woman and her two children. The bandits, a reliable source said, “started their operations in the community from the residence of one Alhaji Magaji Mallaha Makurdi, a businessman who specialises in supplying farm products to companies. They later killed him while shooting sporadically inside his compound before they left with his wife, two children and phone.” The source also told DAILY POST that “the bandits killed a health worker, identified as ‘Dini’, while returning to his Makurdi residence after hanging out at a friend’s barbing around 10pm on that fateful day.” The late Zaharadini is said to be a native of Safana LGA but went to Makurdi to seek refuge from the bandits menace where he finally met his end in the hands of the hoodlums. Late Mallaha’s son, Bishir Magaji, confirmed the attack to DAILY POST during a phone call on Wednesday. He said: “I sent a text message to the police that there was an attack at Makurdi community and that my father was killed while my stepmother and two of my siblings were kidnapped by the bandits. But by the time the police arrived, the bandits had completed their operation and left.” Bishir, however, said that his sister was freed perhaps on health ground on Wednesday but his late father’s wife and the little baby were still in the custody of the bandits Efforts to get more details on the attack from the state police spokesman, SP Isah Gambo, were fruitless.
