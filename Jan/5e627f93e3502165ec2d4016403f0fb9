Former Chelsea midfielder, Oscar, has confirmed he has had discussions with Barcelona over a return to Europe. The Brazilian left Stamford Bridge for China in January 2017. The 30-year-old has remained at Shanghai Port ever since, but could now sign for the LaLiga side. Quizzed by TNT Sports on the Barcelona reports, Oscar said: “Barcelona reached out to my agent to know about this possibility, they knew football in China will stop until March. So maybe, but Barca is facing a difficult time now.” He added: “I was told about this interest, I guess they’re still trying to figure something out. Barca has this issue about registering new signings and they’d still need to sort talks with my club. “They would want me to join until the end of the season. They’re still talking, it’s ongoing, but there’s this problem with the new signings – I guess Dani Alves has faced some. “It’s nice to see a great club interested in you. We didn’t have any talks so far, there’s no point doing that if Barcelona can’t register new players right now. Barca is trying to sort their end out, then maybe I’ll talk to my agent so we can arrange something. “It’d be an incredible opportunity for me, for Barcelona too. I’m in great form here, it would be great for my career. “I suppose Barca would also appreciate it as I’m now more experienced, mature and I know they have a lot of youngsters right now. It could work out for everybody. I’d be happy if things work out, but I still have a contract. Shanghai helps me a lot so I have no complaints.”
