The Emir of Lafiya in Nasarawa State, Sidi Bage, has asked the federal governments and the nation’s elites to renew their social contracts with Nigerians to address the insecurity bedevilling the country. The Emir made the call during the Sardauna’s 8th Memorial Lecture Series on Tuesday. He said human life in today’s northern Nigeria has been degraded by kidnapping for ransom, expressing worry that the situation requires immediate attention. He said, “the time has come to restore the traditional leaders’ role as it was during the pre-colonial times to maximize their contributions if we mean to rescue the situation. The Emir said all States Houses of Assembly must create a special role by giving legal backing to traditional leadership so that they could be seen doing their very best. “If a traditional leader must be removed, he must be caught violating the constitution or extent laws and that should also be after warning him. In his submission, a former High Court Judge, Justice Ishaq Bello, said if you are to give roles to the traditional rulers, he should not be in conflict with politicians. They should not be exposed to embracement and thereby demystifying the traditional institution and sending it to the garbage.
