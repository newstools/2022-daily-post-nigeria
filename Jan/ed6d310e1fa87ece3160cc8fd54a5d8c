Following the successful seizure of 250 wraps of cannabis sativa, otherwise called Indian hemp, the Comptroller Federal Operations Unit, FOU Zone B, of the Nigeria Customs Service, Al-Bashir Hamisu, has on Friday handed over the illicit items to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) in Kaduna. Hamisu said the success was achieved by the Customs in the spirit of inter-agency synergy. He said although the NDLEA were not there when the Customs made the seizures, the handing over was done in line with inter-agency synergy. According to him, Indian hemp and tramadol are illicit items and users are mostly involved in criminal activities. Receiving the items, the Deputy State Commander, Operations and Intelligence, NDLEA Kaduna, Aliyu Mu’azu Danmusa, said that they appreciated Customs, and assured they will investigate those responsible for trafficking the illicit drugs. According to him, the Customs has saved NDLEA from a lot of havoc by intercepting the drugs. It said there would be more criminal activities if they had been allowed into the system. He further added that it wasn’t the first time the FOU was transferring drugs seized to the NDLEA, expressing appreciation to them. In a related development, Hamisu revealed that 60 pieces of jack knives suspected to have been imported by criminal elements would be handed over to the Nigeria Police Force for investigation. According to him, the jack knives were intercepted in Katsina.
